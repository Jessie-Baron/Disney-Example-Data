201845618,5,2014-4,United Kingdom,Fantastic family holiday for a large group which included a baby and older children.We hired a bus to get there which worked well as we could stop at any point. We hired a stunning house in Ebly which was better than we could have expected. Despite the sugar coating I have to say the holiday was fantastic and the park was stunning. The evening light and water show was spectacular and the park was spotlessly clean. Would highly recommend.The only downside was the food. It was unbelievably expensive to buy and much was 'fast food'. Very hard if you are a veggie  take your own food.,Disneyland_Paris
201803302,5,2014-4,Portugal,"The sceneries and atmosphere are incredible with beautiful sets, so you can really get the feel of the World of Disney but the easter holidays are surely to avoid because the lines and times of waiting are so big that you get frustated!",Disneyland_Paris
201801064,5,2013-5,Portugal,"I went there first time with my wife in the year end 2007 and we loved it ! It was really a magic place ! We forget the problems at work , the bills, the pains, the rain, the cold weather, everything... on those days !One of the best holidays we ever had. We loved it ! We were amazed with everything. It exceeded all our expectations. Good happy and fun days !In the Park, everything is prepared and runs with high quality standards and big attention to the amusement details, the decoration... Excellent !We staid there for 3 days and it is the minimum to really enjoy and take advantage of all amusements. Fantastic ! With kids, it's better to plan to stay for more time (1 or 2 days more).Remember that you have Disney park and Studios park to vist as well. 3 days is the minimum .It's impossible to come out from Eurodisney   Disneyland Park Paris without spent money in loooooots of souvenirs). Everything is so funny. Impossible.It is one of the places all people (small and adults) should visit once at least.Also the distance from Disneyland Park to Paris is short and it's easy to go there by train. There are many train that comes and go there hourly. Very easy and fast.We visited the Studios park too in one of the days. Good and fun place as well but i preferred the Disney park.Everything was also always very clean.Now , after 7 years, we are making plans (and saving money) to go there again soon with our kids of 5 and 3 years. Probably we will try to go there in another season , to see how it is Park's 'magic' in the spring summer instead... We will let you know then !Must visit!",Disneyland_Paris
201760447,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"Family visit with 5 adults and my 5 year old grand daughter, we spent 2 days at theme park and stayed at associate hotel. Shuttle bus service to park very good bus every 10 mins and free to use. Entrance to main park reasonably quick. Queues for some rides are long and although you can obtain fast pass timed tickets for some rides the machines for these are not always easy to find. The biggest disappointment in the main park were the lack of characters....none walking around as in Florida ( although that may have changed since I was last there) . My grand daughter loves Rapunzel and we had to queue for 2 hours plus to get a photo . The character would spend 20 mins or so and then go off for a break !!!! Wny not have more than one person in costume ?. Please also be aware that drinks and snacks are extremely overpriced. There are supposed to be numerous staff as helpers but we only saw cleaners around the park. In the studio park there were a lot more characters to be seen but again they are static in one area you queue for an age and are then informed the characters are leaving in 5 minutes, my grand daughter was hugely upset as she was next in line to see Minnie Mouse who promptly left !!!!! 2 rides in this park utilize fast pass Tower of Terror and Aerosmith roller coaster and this does cut down your wait. Overall in summing up..... consider paying extra for fast pass tickets to every attraction ride, mind cost of food drinks in parks, bear in mind some rides close early and also check your park closing time, studio park closed 7pm on day we were there.One important point to note.....if you stay until light show and closing in main park and are using shuttle buses to return to your hotel it is quite dangerous in the bus station with crowds and no queuing system in place, just a free for all push and shove....very worrying if you have small children with you.Final impression .....worth seeing with, in our case a grand child but Florida  Los Angeles parks are so much better organized !!!!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
201717749,5,2014-4,United Kingdom,"Have just returned from four magical days spent in Disneyland. We had four full days in the park and this was a perfect amount of time to be able to see everything without rushing around. The park itself is immaculate and there isn't a piece of litter anywhere! The staff clearly take a great deal of pride in their work and the whole place runs like clockwork. The park opening hours means that you get 12 hours of fun so plenty of time to fit everything in! As it was Easter the park was quite busy but the longest queue we stood in was an hour which is normal for a theme park. The Fastpass system works well but you need to be aware that there are only a limited number of Fastpass tickets each day and we noticed that Peter Pan in particular is very popular so you need to get a Fastpass early on in the day. You are only allowed one Fastpass at a time so you have to plan your activities carefully. The parade is at 5.30 and it is truly magical   the atmosphere is fantastic but make sure you get a good spot to watch it as it's very popular. The laser show and fireworks are absolutely incredible   they don't start until 10pm but are well worth waiting for! The best place to view them is right in front of the castle but again people start to gather early so you need to be there by about 9.30. Don't miss the stunt show in Universal Studios   it is amazing and again like nothing you have ever seen! We stayed in the Magic Circus Hotel and the shuttle buses were excellent but can get very busy, particularly when the park closes. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants on the parks   they are very expensive and so we just took in our own food and drinks. There are some shops in the train station next to the park entrance and you can buy sandwiches etc from there much cheaper. The Disney Village has a range of restaurants but again they are all very expensive   we only ate in Annette's Diner once for convenience but it was 90 Euros for burgers and chips for three adults and two children. We took the train RER A to Val D'Europe shopping centre ( 1 stop on the train) where there are lots of restaurants   we ate at Pizza Del Arte which was lovely   much cheaper and far better value! The shops in Disney are lovely but again expect to pay more than in England. We found that it was harder to meet the characters this time than on our previous visit   last time there were more characters wandering around, we only found Stitch this year, the rest were meet and greets but these were limited with long queues. Finally we bought our tickets from AttractionTix online before we left and found this to be the best price. The tickets were much more expensive if you bought them from the park or the hotels on arrival. It's well worth reading reviews on here as there are loads of useful tips to help you make the most of your visit. Enjoy the magic!!",Disneyland_Paris
201716174,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"My partner and I went here for 4 days (2 at Disney, 2 at the Studios). The park environment is great, very happy place, obviously very busy. There are few rides for older kids, being 20  myself. Most the rides are a tommy tinker boo, slow moving, viewing rides 3 being big rides and only 2 working whilst we were there. Definitely wait for Thunder Mountain, the best ride in this park. Food was good standard, for junk food. Shows were very entertaining. Easy access to the train station, souvenirs and foods are expensive. Be ready to queue and walk around a lot. Altogether not a bad time, fun days out.",Disneyland_Paris
201709800,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"As the title says we've been before but not for some years. We went with reservations because reviews have been dodgy lately. But we were pleasantly surprised   mostly. Things we didn't find a problem were smoking   yes we saw it but it wasn't in our faces and didn't see it in ride queues very much. Toilets were fine   bit whiffy on occasions but they get a huge amount of use.We were there 13 17 April and it was very busy indeed. At times we were overwhelmed by the crowds but having teenagers rather than toddlers and knowledge of the park we were able to escape to quieter areas most of the time. Fantasyland was mayhem most of the time.One problem we did experience, particularly on our last two days was ride closures after we had either joined the queue or started riding them. This was very frustrating. Pirates broke down as we were about to exit and we had to have our boat towed backwards until we could get off and were led out the back by Disney's Fire and Rescue Crew. We had got on Buzz Lightyear during EMH on our last morning to be half way around when the lights came up and we were escorted off. Then we queued 20 mins for Pinnochio, when we almost got to the front they just turfed everyone out of the queue with little explanation. We went on Haunted Mansion about 6 times and every single time we were on the ride would stop for a matter of seconds or a minute and the recording would blast out announcing the pause in the ride and telling us to stay seated. This totally spoilt the atmosphere.The biggest change we noticed in 6 years was the character interaction   or lack of. We have many photos of our youngest son accosting characters in the park where they would be wandering around and interacting with customers. This has now disappeared and the characters are in special meeting areas with very long queues or special character meals in restaurants at huge cost. We felt this was wrong a the characters are one of the things that set Disney parks apart from other theme parks. Our boys are now 15 and nearly 18 and weren't bothered about characters. If they were younger they would have been gutted. Also we missed shows in the Chapperal Theatre and The Lion King show in the Cafe Hyperion, these were always a lovely rest from walking and queueing. The parade was lovely and Disney Dreams breathtaking.People have commented on the rundown state of the park in general but we didn't feel this was an issue. We saw maintenance people painting all over the place and it is a huge job to keep a park like that pristine.To summarise we had a great time but it's not perfect. Where is though? Especially when you bear in mind the whole world has been in recession for years. It's not cheap but we got a deal where we had 4 nights for the price of 2. Top tip: The railway station sells much cheaper drinks, snacks and sandwiches. This can save you a small fortune over a few days for a family.",Disneyland_Paris
201682010,1,2014-4,Turkey,"I am very glad that we only booked our Disneyland Paris holiday for 2 night, but not longer. From the check in till our departure, every minute of the holiday was full of disappointments. Staff were specifically trained to disappear whenever a guest was in need of help. The ones you could find either did not have a clue about the park, or too rude to respond professionally. We stayed at Santa fee, as all others were fully booked. My high school dormitory was Burj Al Arab in comparison. Hotel, park itself and rides were all too dirty. Ques all over, including the entrance to the parks. Worst was to be forced to wait in line for almost 60 minutes although we had reservations for the restaurant. In one case, check in staff at the restaurant could not validate our dinner ticket for 40 minutes straight. He called for help from the manager, and he left after 10 minutes to strengthen the agony. In the age of smart phones and fast computers, it is a disgrace for Disney park to keep guests waiting for hourst to check into a restaurant. It is obvious that we have paid for the food months in advance. Why keep waiting because of ignorant staff and managers? If anybody is willing to visit Disneyland Paris, I strongly urge to rethink. At least try to book Florida instead. You will save yourself the most expensive disappointment of vacation history. I strongly believe that American management is too tired of fighting with French arrogance and just let it be.",Disneyland_Paris
201660088,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time in here, Watching the Dreams show, The Spring parade and the evening parades, Lots to see   especially all the intricate details all down Main Street...

Rides were varied for all ages and queues were around 30 50 minutes per ride. Shops are plentiful but expensive. Food is burger chips although there is an odd restaurant but these are even more pricy and you need to book. Disappointed that the Disney characters are roaming around but they are at specific points but again you have to queue to see them. Its very clean and there are plenty of staff around to help you with any queries you may have.",Disneyland_Paris
201632110,2,2014-4,Netherlands,Sorry guys .... theoretically this place is full of charm but practically its a very expensive experience and an exhausting one.

201461455,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"The park is beautiful in the spring sunshine but from the point of booking to our stay we were given no useful information at all. I was particulary disappointed to find myself directed straight to the park despite having paid for the bag service. This is not labelled if you arrive by RER   it is geared for those arriving from Eurostar. We couldnt find the bag drop off and no one we asked could help. we walked into the bag and asked at the bag check and the staff there waved us stright through. we arrived at the gates and I was asked for our tickets. I explained I had been told to come to the gates and was sent back to the station (but still not told how to find the desk). Back we went. By now running out of the hour we had planned to enjoy before the park opens to the public. We found a policeman who explained we had to go up the stairs to find the desk. The man there took our bags. Then said oh I am sorry but your tickets are not here as we have you down as arriving on Eurostar at 2pm. I explained I had no idea how this could be given that I had I told the lady who took the booking I was coming early in the morning on the RER. I asked him to find a solution and moments later our tickets for that day appeared but no program or map was proffered. Back to the park we went and back to the queue for the bag check, back to the queue for entry and into the park. Once we reached the castle (beautiful) we found a helper and asked for a map. we were directed back to the entrance. Really should it be this much work??? By the time we reached the first ride the queue was 30 minutes. Luckily after that luck was with us and we didnt queue for more than 15 minutes for any ride after that on that day. We were also disappointed to arrive at the Movie Land on day 2 of our visit for the special 9 a,m opening for hotel visitors only to learn this did not open early. the lady who checked us in at the hotel failed to mention it as did any of the staff we spoke to which I find unhelpful. All the same we wil be back because the rides are wonderful",Disneyland_Paris

DO NOT MISS THE SHOW at 9.30 near the castle. I had never seen anything like it before. Book tickets online to save the hassle of queues and also to save some money.Thank You",Disneyland_Paris

201376248,3,2014-4,Switzerland,"Just come back from Disneyland Park in Paris   what a let down!We chose not to stay in a Disney hotel as they were out of our budget, so couldn't get into Disneyland Park until 10am on a Saturday. It was rammed with people, which was what we had expected. Quite a few rides were closed for maintenance, so we chose not to go to Walt Disney Studios as Stitch Live and Crush's Coaster were closed.I'd heard about the Fast Pass system so we stamped a pass for Space Mountain then queued for Star Tours. Even though it was the first ride of the morning, the queue took 1hr20 (!!!) due to maintenance issues which they only told us about after 45 mins. The ride took 4 mins tops, and was fun but distinctly underwhelming and in need of refurbishment. Exit through the gift shop... We then rushed back to Space Mountain, managed to squeeze into the Fast Pass queue, only to hear after 20 mins that the ride had broken down... so we had another long wait (45 mins) for another ride that was over in minutes.By this point it was lunchtime already. We had queued for over 2 hours and spent less than 10 minutes on rides. We stamped a Fast Pass for Buzz Lightyear and had some lunch at Pizza Planet, which was actually fine, considering it looks like it will be really dire. Found the only play area of the day, where the kids could let off a bit of steam.Buzz Lightyear was fine. The Castle, the Aladdin bit and the Pirate island were lovely; really nicely done. Pirates of the Caribbean was a laugh, and we ate dinner in the Blue Lagoon restaurant, which was fun and not fast food which is everywhere. But I was disappointed to find DLP was all 100% free of magic of any kind, unless you really REALLY like shopping.I understand that it's not high season, but most of the coffee stops and restaurants were really under staffed, meaning more big queues as one poor teenager tried to sort coffees, crepes, ice creams and the money side of things. It all felt as if it was being run on the cheap with the aim of getting the most money out of visitors as possible, which was horrible seeing as we'd paid so much for the trip, hotel and park entrance anyway. The only Disney personalities we saw were Captain Hook and Smee, from a distance, mobbed by children, so chose not to queue even longer to meet them. All the shows were closed, which we had no way of knowing when we booked our tickets last year.I was really looking forward to it but ended up spending most of the day queuing, and saying no to my kids, as of course it is impossible to avoid the shops.There was also a lot of emphasis put on the fireworks display, which took place at 10pm i.e. two full hours after my kids are usually in bed. It took a lot of barging and about 25 mins to get back to our hotel from the park, so I couldn't let them stay up for it, and they were really disappointed. I can understand a late display in the summer, but it was dark by 8pm when we were there so they could've had it early, or not shown so much video about it during all the queuing you are forced to do. I got the distinct feeling that it was so late so that they could entice people to stay longer and spend more money. Made me feel shabby.Kids loved it of course. For magic, great rides, well managed queues, awesome shows, beautiful surroundings, really special hotels and lots of friendly personalities who will take time to greet your kids and make them feel special, go to Europa Park in Germany. It's lovely. Disneyland is like a shopping mall in comparison.",Disneyland_Paris
201371309,1,2014-4,United Kingdom,"An extortionate amount of money for a very below average experience. 3 big rides were closed with no notification at the gate. Many of the rides had parts closed meaning that the queues were longer. On some rides people were blatantly pushing in with no organisation from the staff. Very few characters to be seen, poor service, tepid food at extortionate prices and to cap it all my niece was insulted by a member of staff, which caused her to cry. I will never visit again, the Florida theme park although expensive at least allows the adults to share in some of the magic, Disneyland Paris just leaves a very bad taste in the mouth.",Disneyland_Paris
201368356,3,2013-5,United Kingdom,"If your planning on doing Disney do it right and go to Florida. I Visited the Parris Park with High Expectations which sadly were not met. If shopping for fridge magnets is your thing then its great there are 10 shops every half mile all selling the exact same stock. The Food wasn't so bad there were lots of carts selling Ice Creams and lollies which was handy and in the cafes a lot of the staff spoke at least basic English again very helpful. It Disappointed me that at the time I was around 14 (so not a young child e.g. toddler) and the characters found this enough to refuse to sign my book after waiting patiently for 35 minutes in a queue as there were younger children who had been waiting 15 minutes. This happened repeatedly. A lot of the rides were closed on the day I visited. the ones that were open were pitched at 5 6 year olds so not suited. I tried but could not find a information centre to help me find something to enjoy the day there (Not saying there was not one there just hard to locate) The only two points I did enjoy were the Big Pink castle to have my picture taken with it in the back ground and the show put on by the characters, get there 1 hour early if you want to be able to see anything!Overall if you have very young children e.g. 3 4 then this may suit you but anything over the age of 10 11 it is worth paying the extra and going the whole way to Florida.",Disneyland_Paris

We had 48 students (High School show choir) with us and they were there to celebrate the 50th anniversary of  It's a small world . The parks and rides are generally smaller than ours here in the states, but so were the waits in line! Food was a bit hard to find as many of the restaurants were closed which was a bit weird. The fire works and laser show at the end was incredible!! I've been to Disney World and Disney Land and just as with those two the Park Employees are the real difference and those in Paris were NOT rude!!

I've only been to Disney World in Florida and even though Florida is more extensive, this one is still very nice. It's smaller than the other parks so do not expect anything crazy for this park. You can get through both parks in one day because if you spend a day per park you may not feel very fulfilled because, again it is pretty small compared to the other parks. The prices for food are very reasonable compared to what you usually pay to eat in Paris and the food is actually good! The rides are a lot of fun! The new crush coaster that's based off of Finding Nemo is a lot of fun! The rides are less intense than those in Orlando, but they are enjoyable.

201077338,4,2014-1,United Kingdom,"It was amazing. All the characters I wanted to see were there (if you look at the park guide it clearly shows what times characters will be there to meet and greet) but if you don   t want to queue then the parades have all the characters in them and they are good if a little bit short (both are no more than 5 minutes long for all the floats to go through). There are certainly more restaurants and shops than attractions but Disney do the rides excellently (the best one in the park is definitely Buzz Lightyear spaceranger spin. Unfortunately Indiana Jones was closed but did that previously and its v rickety. Phantom Manor was not as good as I remember it to be which is a shame. Big Thunder Mountain is better than Space Mountain (it was nice doing this before the queues). Visiting during the week and off season (January 2014) was definitely the way to go for a more relaxed experience. Can do it all in a day off season too with careful planning (the dark rides in Fantasyland look dare I say it cheap and cardboard full whereas its a small world is just stunningly detailed). Sequoia Lodge is really good esp golden forest club experience we had. The sheer amount of characters in the parade is staggering but here goes:  the three fairies (I'm sure we also missed Merlin and the Fairy Godmother) , Anna and Elsa, Rapunzel and Flynn, Aurora and Prince Philip, Cinderella and Prince Charming, Snow wWhite and her Prince in large carriages (v much missing Tiana and Naveen  are they not being promoted anymore  there is space enough on the float for them!)   no need to pay for really expensive meal at auberge de cenderillion (we missed the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter but went to the maze which made up for that!), Pinocchio and Gepetto, Buzz and Woody, Winnie the Pooh and friends, Rafiki, Simba, Pumbaa and Timon and Zazu, Smee, Captain Hook and Peter Pan (wheres Wendy?)

201006110,1,2013-11,United States,"Disneyland Paris is an embarrassment to the Walt Disney Company. What's wrong with the park? Everything! From the time we checked in, to the time we left, the entire experience was awful. For specifics on the hotel, check out my review on the Sequoia Lodge here: yelp.com biz sequoia lod   As for the park itself, it was very poorly maintained. There was trash all over the place, rides kept breaking down and the employees were generally unfriendly. We did meet one genuinely friendly fellow in one of the gift shops that was truly delighted that I wanted to trade pins with him and even more delighted when he found out that I'm from Hawaii. But that was the highlight of our entire experience there. Food is another area the park falls flat on its face. You'd expect food at a theme park to be bad, but I wouldn't expect it to be inedible. We had a burger in the park for lunch one day, and its flavor reminded me of the smell of dog food... I took a bite and couldn't eat it anymore. And if you want to eat in one of the overpriced restaurants, you have to make a reservation the day before... for lunch or for dinner! And most of the food services weren't even open despite the enormous crowd. Granted it was November when we went, but if park attendance is that high... The wait for the rides were ridiculous too. Disneyland RR, for example, had only 1 train running. That was it. It was a 45 minute wait between each time the train went around. You'd think they'd run at least 2? Would I ever go back? No. Once was enough for me... Never again with Disneyland Paris. It's nice to have been able to gone to see what it's like, but it really isn't worth staying for even an entire day.",Disneyland_Paris

The parade was so disappointing as it was so short but to be fair it was my grand children's first visit to a Disney Park so they loved seeing the Princesses etc in the Parade however short it was.,Disneyland_Paris
200898227,3,2014-4,Germany,"Liked the parades, especially the late evening one.  DIsliked the many technical problems with the rides and numbers of rides out of action, and total lack of any Disney characters anywhere.",Disneyland_Paris
200827460,5,2014-3,United Kingdom,i loved this place brought tears to my eyes when i saw how stunning it looked. very clean great place to take the kids.,Disneyland_Paris
200797441,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"Many reviewers compare Disneyland Paris to Florida, but if you live in the UK this is an unfair comparison. Florida costs thousands   we had 5 wonderful days in Disneyland Paris for   1000 for a family of 4. Compared to some of the average theme parks in the UK, Disneyland Paris wins hands down. The shows parades are fantastic, the atmosphere wonderful and my kids absolutely loved it.Yes, it's not perfect   a little tired in places   but compared to UK theme parks immaculate. Food and drink is extortionate   so take your own snacks.Queues can be long for some rides, but when we went (April) most rides had queues no longer than 10 mins  plan ahead, save the busy rides for quiet times.",Disneyland_Paris
200783786,4,2014-4,United States,Staying at the Disneyland Hotel (literally on top of the park entrance) is great if you can afford it. It allows a quick escape from the Park for nap time or quick changes of messy clothing. The buffet breakfast was great. Everyone says age six is the be,Disneyland_Paris
200736762,5,2014-4,United Kingdom,Great short break. Definitely a trip for all the family. We had a wonderful shirt break. Kids loved it.,Disneyland_Paris
200681231,4,2014-4,Belgium,"Went to the park for like the third time. I   ve visited it back in the 90   s during their opening year, about 4 years ago and now again.I love Disney! It has a magical attraction both for children and adults. I love the whole vibe, with the music playing, the nice shops and the overall buzz of happiness.The park itself is beautiful. Everything is very well maintained and the flowers and trees look amazing.When I compare to previous years I did notice that some of the attractions are in need of some TLC. This resulted in some of them breaking down during the day for an hour or so. We got lucky when they just re opened the Space Mountain in front of us and we stormed in like idiots to get the first ride     Unfortunately afterwards Big Thunder Mountain broke down just when we were about to cash in our Fast Pass. Fast Passes are great by the way. Just plan your visit a little and you can avoid the waiting lines on most big rides. The only one we actually queued for was the Pirates of the Caribbean. The Disney Studios are not as crowded as Disney itself and we only headed to the main park after 6 o   clock when it started to calm down. The food quality has definitely improved (both in the parks and Disney Village  over the last couple of years. I remember it being horrible at first, it was better last time but this time they really got it right (after 20 years). I know some people complain about the prices in the restaurants and the shops. If you want a cheap weekend getaway this is not the place to go. This is to get the Disney experience but it   ll cost ya.Finally, I see some people have mentioned that you don   t see as much Disney figures in the park as you used to. That was what we noticed too. We only encountered a couple during 2 days in the park (none in the Studios actually) It   s a petty. We went to Orlando last year and you couldn   t take 5 steps without running into one of them.",Disneyland_Paris
200667656,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"After visiting Disneyworld recently we were a little worried we were making a mistake coming here thinking it would be nowhere near as good. We were wrong. Obviously it is not Disneyworld but we still had a great time, some of the rides were better than the same ones in Florida, such as Space Mountain. You have to have your wits about you when queueing as we witnessed queue jumpers five times. No one got past me however but my children were scared not to let them past so I had to act like bouncer! We were very disappointed in the lack of characters, luckily we had booked Cafe Mickey and that was the only place we got photos and autographs.",Disneyland_Paris
200664562,5,2013-11,Malta,Really beautiful place. Had an amazing time and would go again. Reccommended for family trips as kids would have an awesome time there.,Disneyland_Paris
200631109,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"We took our two grandchildren here for a break. They enjoyed it thoughly but we felt it was too commercialised, well it is Disneyland. The positive was that they enjoyed it and the negatives were:Like a cattle market all the time, you get pushed, shoved, moved all the time, people with no manners only hell bent on getting to front of line before you or getting better place of view.Breakfast time was appalling, too many people in such small a space that you cannot even balance a tray in your hand without being knocked over literally.Meal plan tickets   do not buy   waste of time. wE HAD half board and it was worth at time of travel, 33 euros for adults and 15 euros for children. What they do not tell you is that if you do not spend the exact amount you either get no change or have to make up the overspent amount. Also you can only have certain drinks in this plan. You need to book a reservation as well before hand otherwise queue or risk not being allowed in. Don't forget the mobile phone otherwise most phones you will find are French card phones thereby paying again.Hotels well yes we did book a two star and yes it was nice and yes we had a kettle, however, that was it no coffee, tea or sugar or milk, you pay extra for these.Do not book a meet and greet character for your darlings. You can meet and greet these anywhere within the Disney parks or by booking Cafe Mickey beforehand.Do expect long queues unless you use the fastrack ticket to secure a time for your next ride (one at a time I hasten to add) and the rides are not as long as fairground rides over here.You get checked going in for security   yes I understand security issues fully   by putting your bag on conveyer belt and it is scanned, you as a person are not and some with buggies were allowed through without any scanning cos they stated they had no bags. Am I missing something here?Expect high prices, you are in Paris after all and it is a money making venture, so take plenty of money with you. Steaks at Disneyland Steakhouse were from 45 euros each.Take the shuttle bus service from the airport as it takes you right to hotel and is fast and when you find the stop that is, efficient enough. The airport takes a bit of getting used to as it is vast and not always clearly marked for directions.Good luck with the hoards of arrogant people who are there, all out for themselves and the children who are constantly dressed and paraded as princes and princesses, a little OTT for me although from a childs point of view?",Disneyland_Paris
200597309,5,2014-4,Australia,"Loved the dream show at closing time. It is definitely worth making the children stay up late to watch as it gives you goose bumps!The down side of the park is the prices of all food and drinks, very high! Try to bring in your own if you can to keep costs down!Also be prepared to queue for a long time if you wish to see the Disney princess as always a long queue!",Disneyland_Paris
200596902,4,2013-12,United Kingdom,"This was my 2nd time visiting Disneyland Park and it was just as fun as when i went in 2008 when i was 16 and this time was for my 21st birthday. i did notice back then there were more characters around for photos. We had lunch one day at Cafe Mickey which i would recommend as this is a chance to see some of the characters and i had pictures with, mickey mouse, gepetto, pluto and eeyore.The park itself is quite busy which is expected although the queue times for the rides were no longer than an hour and we managed to get on everything we wanted to (excluding crush's coaster which was 90 min wait and forever busy!!!) Lots of shops, all seemed to be selling the same thing which seemed a bit pointless. Some of the rides are open until late which is a good chance to get on any you might have missed in the day and we found doing the fast pass was a good idea if you could coincide them to go straight from one ride off to another. A must for children and a great place for adults to enjoy also. The parades are worth watching.",Disneyland_Paris
200565573,3,2014-4,United Kingdom,"We recently visited the park and I have to say that we were a little disappointed. For the amount that we spent on a ticket & other extras I would expect this money to be put to good use on updating and maintaining the park. However, the theme park feels aged and tired. Whilst we were there a number of rides experienced long technical faults, resulting in us wasting hours queuing only to be told to leave the queue line. I would at least have expected a complimentary fast pass for a different ride to make up for the time wasted; all we received was a disinterested shrug. The whole park feels like the poor cousin to the American theme parks, with very little value for money. There's no denying that the atmosphere in the theme park is wonderful, especially for the younger children, but the attractions themselves are in definite need of some TLC.",Disneyland_Paris
200503992,5,2014-4,United Kingdom,"I mean yes Disneyworld in Orlando is much better but for a little break Disneyland is good enough! All the favourites are there, Thunder Mountain, Space Mountain, Star Tours, It's a Small World and newer favourites such as Buzz Lightyear's Laser Blaster which is just fantastic! Meeting Mickey Mouse is a must and for all the little princesses out there there is the Princess Parlour where you can meet a princess.",Disneyland_Paris
200496607,3,2014-4,Belgium,"Long story short: this is really nice for the children. It's like a dream for them to meet the Disney caracters and to see the Disney Parade. The parc is really well organized and clean. Everything is done to help the public to find something to do...but:Sometimes it's really a pain to wait in the line 45 min and to do a 2 min attraction ride. Really!?So if you have children able to wait so long for so few, ok.So my best advice it's to go there when you can be sure that the parc will be half empty!!When it's full you have to wait for everything (except the toilets, thanks God)..If you go there without children for some sensations, be prepared to wait 1h00 for the best attractions so in one day if you're lucky you can do 4....",Disneyland_Paris

200377213,3,2014-4,United States,"Coming from the US & visiting Paris, 3 26   4 1, we wanted to see Disney Paris. I tried not to judge the park on the the Orlando standards, but the park itself. I found the park to show some of its age. Wear & tear were apparent on the rides, some rides had broken down the day we were there. Over @ Disney Studios there seem to be a shortage of toilets, the ladies room had a line 10 deep outside the door. Due to seasonal restrictions some of the restaurants were closed, making the few that were open very crowded. Casey's Hot Dog Stand was closed, a majority of people were trying to get a Hot Dog, but , not able because it was closed. Being an American I think the Hot Dog Stand should be open whenever the Park is open. There were limited number of character roaming the park. The staff were friendly & helpful. Easy commute from Paris on the RER A line. Nothing special, just average. Visit all the hot spots in Paris first, then go to Disney",Disneyland_Paris
200363098,4,2014-3,United Kingdom,Its absolutely wonderful for both kids and parents. We took a train from mid paris and in 40 minutes were in front of the gates. Large park with lots of rides for all ages. Nice joyful atmosphere all around with lots of walking to do & sights to see. Only gripe was the long wait for many rides..The parade & lightshow are worth jostling in the crowds for.,Disneyland_Paris

We will be going back very soon.",Disneyland_Paris
200319918,5,2014-3,Ireland,We loved every minuite of Disneyland parks. The fireworks where amazing. All the people involved in each ride made it great. One girl dressed as a pirate on the ship made my little boys dreams she played with him and kept in charcter. It was great fun. All the help with the baby swop on the rides was great and efficent.,Disneyland_Paris
200314241,4,2014-2,United States,"I am a 20 year old princess at heart exchange student in France, and I took a trip to Disney with my colleague for her 21st birthday on February 1st! My first Disney experience was in Florida and it was incredibly sunny and warm, and I loved it. This was not the case here in France. It was a little chilly and pretty cloudy, but at least we expected the weather to be this way and prepared for rain (and we refused to let this deter us from having a good time)! The lines weren't crowded, and the staff were friendly. Of all the rides and sights Disneyland Paris has to offer, the most beautiful is Sleeping Beauty's castle. I must have taken 50 pictures of it. We covered the entire classical park in a day and went on many rides from Space Mountain to Pirates of the Caribbean. After watching a wonderful afternoon parade performance by the Disney characters and resembling the small children with the excitement on our faces, we made a dash for the cr  pe and waffle shop. I had a delicious nutella cr  pe, and I even finished off my friend's waffle. Very satisfying! My friend's 21st birthday and first time Disney experience was magical, and it is no surprise that Disney truly can make anyone happy, no matter the weather, no matter the age. And so we continue to live happily ever after!",Disneyland_Paris
200263042,3,2014-4,United States,We have been going to disney land paris since it opened and have always found it to be very customer friendly until today when we queued over an hour with a child with ADHD bearing in mind that the park was very busy it was daft that half the resturants were shut. Please be awear that the prices are appoxamatley 2euros higher that posted on their web site. It is ridiculous that we can have a fast pass for rides and not resturants as this makes a very unpleasant time for us and anyone else in the queue as it is very difficult to amuse a child with his disability for this length of time so be awear and take a packed lunch you can eat out side the numerous number of shut resturants.,Disneyland_Paris
200172804,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"I hate theme parks. I really hate them. But Disney got me with their magic! Admittedly we went mid week out of school holiday time so it was quiet. We never queued for more than ten minutes for a ride. So in two days we had gone around the whole park at least twice! Staff are good, lots of places to eat and drink and its very clean. There are rides for all ages (our 3 year old son was never bored) and our 7 year old could go on most rides too. The Parade and lights firework shows were good and the mid day mini parades were fun. I cant think about anything that wasn't good! It makes the UK theme parks look really pathetic.",Disneyland_Paris
200096996,4,2014-3,United Kingdom,"I have visited Disneyland Pairs 4 times and have had a fab time but this time there seemed to be somthing missing. The parades were much sorter with less dancers, less caracters unless your in the right place at the right time, less staff around the whole park even the background music was not like before. But with saying all this we still had a lovely time and would this would not put us off going again.Using the extra majic hours if you are staying in a disney hotel is good. We ate in the plazza gardens a few times which had lovely food we used our half board vouchers which entitled us to have a 3 course meal and drink. We did book a resavation at our hotel the night before but always got the time we wanted. The disney dreams show at the end of the day is not to be missed we watched this twice during our stay it is fabulous.",Disneyland_Paris
200056078,5,2014-4,United Kingdom,"IntroductionDisneyland Paris is not one but two beautiful parks for all the family to enjoy. The Disney Company have created a    magical    environment with bright colourful buildings, costumed staff, themed music and wonderful lighting when dark. They have various rides for all ages and parades  shows to enjoy each day.Having just visited in April 2014, I want to provide some useful information for new timers travelling to the resort.Plan your stayVisit the official web site http:  www.disneylandparis.co.uk to check out opening times, which rides will be closed for maintenance and what time the shows run. We also used http:  www.dlrpmagic.com which has very useful information. Within planning Advice section they have ride, queue time information and money saving tips. Some rides have height restrictions, are noisy or can be frightening for the young, so make sure you make your own list of    must do    rides and events. The time goes quickly after you arrive so planning ahead is important.Journey outEurostar offer one direct train from London to Disneyland Paris each day, this service varies through the year so check availability. It is an easy journey which delivers you to the gates of the park.We departed from Ebsfleet International, aiming to arrive two hours early should accidents delay us. The Ebsfleet departure gate was open despite how early we arrived and check in through the French security was straight forward. There is a small departures waiting area after this with a couple of shops and toilets. Around 15 minutes before the train arrives you are allowed onto the platform which is clearly marked with the carriage numbers.When the Eurostar arrives put your big luggage into the racks by the door and small luggage above your seat. There is limited space for luggage in the train so take as little as you can, I noticed there are areas behind the seats too if it is busy. Booked seats do not always work out together so you may need to ask if anyone would swap. See http:  www.eurostar4agents.com files Eurostar seat plan UK.pdf for the seat plan.On the journey a Disney cast member (Disney employee) will pass through the carriage and provide tickets for your stay at Disneyland. You will be given park tickets (they are credit card size and have Disney characters printed on them, one for each person. On the back will be    enfant    and    adulte    plus the days the tickets are usable), hotel booking information, a meal ticket for each person  for each day (half board for the young and full board for adults), travel tickets for each person (for any booked journeys out of the park),    Disney Express    luggage labels if staying at a Disney hotel (write your name on the labels, put onto your luggage and remove the bottom ticket to pick up the luggage). Check that you have all the correct items before the cast member leaves.On the Standard premier carriages the seats have a little more room and either breakfast or a small dinner is served on the journey. Keep a little tea in your cup when you have eaten your meal as you may have three top ups through the journey. Speak to Eurostar a few weeks before your journey to choose meals for your children; ours did not like what was offered on the train.Arriving at Disneyland ParisWe could have delivered our luggage to the    Disney Express    team but as the train was delayed by an hour we headed straight to the hotel. Disney have free    bendy    coaches every 12 minutes from the station. It was crowded and we later found took much longer than it would have walking!Once at the hotel the arrivals desk was busy, have your passport and tickets provided on the train to hand. The staff will provide you with even more tickets  cards plus the room details. You need to choose the days for any planned trips and times for breakfast. Remember to book into the restaurant too if you plan to go any specific times. We aimed to book for opening times for both breakfast and the restaurant when it is least busy.The ParkBe prepared for the shops and food on offer. They are the first to greet you when entering, after each major ride, dotted around the park and when leaving. We asked our children to look through them all before deciding what they would like to buy which meant delaying purchases to the end of our visit (you may not be as mean). The shops have good quality merchandise themed for each area; I found it all very tempting as an adult so cannot imagine how children must feel. Pick up a park map and head for the    City Hall    if you require any more information. City hall will also provide a special sticker for anyone celebrating a birthday for special treatment.Be prepared to queue. The resort was not busy when we visited but the queue systems are vast for some of the rides. The larger rides have a    Fastpass    system (look for the FP symbol on the map), a free service to jump the queues. Scan each of your park entrance ticket at a Fastpass terminal located near the entrance to the ride and take your time ticket. Once your time arrives go to the Fastpass entrance and show the cast member your time ticket, they will let you through. You can do this multiple times through the day but only have one Fastpass time ticket at a time. If you miss your time slot (about 30 minutes) the cast member may refuse your entry.After completing a ride or meeting Disney Characters with professional photographers ask for a Disney    Photopass   . Disney Character and ride pictures can be linked to the Photopass and purchased up to 7 days later within the park, it gives you time to think if you really would like one from your stay but don   t forget to ask for the card to be scanned after each photo. We also found that the photographers were happy to take pictures with your own camera if asked.There are water fountains throughout the park but we noticed many were not working.Some people smoke around the park which is only allowed in certain areas but this does not seem to be enforced.Be prepared for the weather. We were very lucky with warm sunny weather on our visit but it can be cold and wet. A lot of the areas have extra cover to help.Disney    Magic on Parade    is a procession of themed floats with Disney characters dancing and waving to the guests. With the    Magic Everywhere    music, it is a good feel factor event for the children. Look for the black dots on the map to pick a location and arrive at least 20 30 minutes before it starts (17.15) to be at the front of the crowds. If you are not interested in this event then it is a good time to go on the busier rides.The    Disney Dreams    show start at 21.30 and runs to the end of September 2014. It is a spectacular projected image, firework, laser and light show designed for the 20th birthday at Disney Paris. Be in view of the front of the castle, the middle is better due to the speakers. You will need to arrive 40 60 minutes early to be at the front, but don   t panic too much if you arrive late as it is amazing even from a distance. If you have young children make sure you plan at least one evening to see the parks closing show. Be warned that some of the rides close down behind this show, however it is a great time to go to rides, we enjoyed seeing the fireworks whilst riding    Big Thunder Mountain    my own families favourite ride.Don   t be fooled by the small presence on the map of the Walt Disney Studios. Many of the shows are timed and run for 20 30 minutes. Some only run once or twice a day so plan as much as you can before you enter. See http:  www.disneylandparis.co.uk content GB EN Neutral system images ShowsAndParades.pdf for show times. We spent a full day at this park and did not go to every event. The youngest member of our family adored the Studio Tram Tour and went back many times. My own favourite was the Moteurs stunt spectacular, the least was the Tower of Terror which my children adored.The HotelThe Sequoia Lodge was peaceful within a tree surrounding. Many of the ground floor doors are alarmed from 11pm to 6am so can be used for an easier route to breakfast and the park. The breakfasts and buffet was vast and exceeded my own and my children needs. The room was comfortable and clean. The double beds are located in one room, it seems that each room is linked together with locking doors in between, so it would be possible to rent two rooms together. I would recommend taking at least one small euro travel adapter. The plugs were located by the TV, by the door and above the sink, the one by the TV has little space around. With the very long days (6am 11pm) and walks our children slept well. The TV had English stations and a 10 step    must see whilst staying    guide. The pool was small and a little cold but good fun for the children with a water slide, in truth we only found a 30 minute gap that they could visit the pool!Departing DisneyOur children knew exactly what they wanted by the end of our stay and very wise purchases they were! We dropped our hotel passes in a box near to the hotel checkout desk (not owing any money for services) and took our luggage to    Disney Express    at the hotel (drop off before 10am), they transported it to the station whilst we went on a few of our favourite rides in both parks. We arrived about two hours early at the station to pick our luggage up at Disney Express located on the top floor (the signs can be confusing) and then through security at the station. It seemed busy and rushed, we were glad to have arrived early and found once through security being held at the top of the station with no shops or toilets (so be prepared). The train boarded about an hour before it departed, there were no carriage number signs on the platform, either ask a member of staff or look at the electronic sign next to the carriage door. The ride home was very fast (gaining an hour on the way back) and smooth.You have made it to the end of my post. If you travel to Disneyland Paris I wish you a truly amazing and epic (as my children say) time at the resort. The Disney crew appear to work extremely hard to keep everything clean, well presented and exciting. Don   t forget to give them a smile or to say thank you. Most of all make sure you share the 'magic' with your children.",Disneyland_Paris
200049330,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"There were a lot of attractions for all ages, but there were a few rides closed for refurbishment as well as some of the rides broke down quite a lot, especially the buzz lightyear ride! We hired a pushchair which was stolen towards the end of the day, which is not great when you have a $70 deposit to collect on it. One of the perks from staying in the disney hotel is that you can access the parks 2 hours before they open, however it later came to light that this was only the disneyland park and only areas.",Disneyland_Paris
200012786,3,2014-4,Australia,Looking forward to the land of magic lost some of its sparkle with major rides closed such as Indiana Jones plus malfunctions on the Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain rides saw close to two hours lost in queues. Food was OK at best and drinks far from cold. The cleanliness of the park was excellent as was the washrooms. What was impressive is the level of detail and construction on all the displays. Would see the park ideal for younger families. Overall if you are looking for adventure theme parks are are many better.,Disneyland_Paris

199881148,3,2014-3,Vietnam,"Hope this is helpful.If travelling by Eurostar dont bother with the advance check in service offered by Disney. Simply use the free shuttle buses from outside the train station and check yourself in and save money.The breakfast is pretty poor so dont waste time booking a slot. Use the magic hours to get in the park before the masses and have breakfast in the park. The longest queue is for Thunder Mountain so do this first. When the queue splits take the right queue as this moves quicker. The food and drink in the Disney Village is overpriced, however, Cafe Mickey is a great laugh with full on interaction with the characters. Stay at your table though as you will be ushered away if you approach the characters. Avoid McDonalds, they haven't got a clue. Service in Planet Hollywood is appalling. Bon Voyage!",Disneyland_Paris

199844756,5,2014-3,Slovakia,"Disneyland park in France is just wonderful. I cannot compare it with other Disneyland parks as this was my first visit ever, but i love it. It is very big and although there are many people everyday it is clean. In the time of our staying in the park 4 attractions were closed, but it was OK because there were many others. We spent there three days and we didnt see everything. We will definitely return back. Our children were very happy. Yes, maybe the food and shops are overpriced but you can find also some cheaper alternatives for eating. You can choose cheaper or more expensive restaurants. The only cons of this park are the queues for the attractions, we were sometimes tired and bored while waiting for an attraction.",Disneyland_Paris
199770830,4,2014-3,United Kingdom,"There are good and bad points but generally my experience of Disneyland Paris was really good.We stayed at the New York Hotel, we took advantage of the magic extra hours a few mornings which are from 8am to 10am. I come to my first negative, there are not a lot of rides open during this time. Staying and paying the price of staying at a Disney Hotel I feel we need more benefits and get more access to rides and different areas of the park. In the extra hours, the only areas that are open are Fantasyland and Tomorrowland, but not all the rides are open. In Fantasyland, the rides that are open are Le Carrousel de Lancelot, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Mad Hatter's Tea Cups and    it's a small world   . In Tomorrowland its, Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast, Orbitron and Space Mountain. So not much is open. You could do all these rides before 10. But the good thing about being in the park early, is that when the rest of the rides do open at 10am, you can be there ready to get in the queue before anyone else. We couldn't do this as we choose our breakfast slot for 10.30 so we could make the most of the extra hours and not have to be up super early and then go back and have breakfast. But there is a 7am breakfast slot.The parades are brilliant, thats one thing Disney do best. I was disappointed that I didn't see Merida, but yet the Princesses from Frozen where there. But I hear that Merida will make her first Disneyland Paris appearance this spring summer.I didn't see that much characters around the park, could have been because we went back for breakfast and weren't back in the park until about 11.30 and where on rides most of the time, rather than wondering around the park, so possibly missed their appearances.The night time Disney Dreams show was amazing! Disney knows how to put on a show. The fireworks and the projections onto the castle with the music was just amazing! The queues for the rides where surprisingly short, going in March I think was a good decision as it was off season. The longest we have to queue for any ride was Thunder Mountain, which was 45 minutes and then it broke down and closed so that was a bit disappointing but nothing can be done about that, and they gave us fast passes for that evening. But everything else in the park was a really short wait. We didn't need fast passes for anything in that park.The only thing that really angers me about queue though is people that budge the queues. We were really lucky as it didn't happen that much to us, and we did hear a lot of stories about the French cutting the queues. We did have some incidents in the space mountain queue and thunder mountain. But the park is great for all ages, not a lot of big rides but Disneyland is aimed for kids. And brings your inner kid out of you. Everyone is running around excited, wearing silly hats and minnie mouse ears and just having a great time. Space Mountain is got to be one of the best rides there. Compared to the one in Florida, the Paris one is much better, as it has loops and goes much faster.The only bad thing about going at March time is that a few of the best rides were closed for refurbishment such as Indiana Jones and Peter Pan's Flight and some of the rides in the other park were closed too which was disappointing but I did know this before I went.But a part from the bad points, my generally experience of the park was very good. A lot of the staff were very nice, you do get a few rude and unhappy ones, but a lot of them were very helpful.I do like Florida better as its better and has more parks, but Paris is easier to get to and I still had a great time. I will defiantly be going back.",Disneyland_Paris
199752026,2,2013-5,United States,"Let me preface this by saying that I've made close to 30 trips to Disneyland and to Walt Disney World. I've always been impressed by the Disney brand and it's dedication to quality. I'm working outisde the US, and when I got a chance to take a trip I thought I'd include Disneyland Paris. Bad idea. What I found out later is that the Disney Corporation does not own the Disney parks outside the US. They rent the names and some of the attraction names. I haven't been to any of the other non US parks, but this park was alrgely an embarrassment to Walt's name. To begin with, the customer service was lousy. When something bad happens in Walt Disney World, they let you know, they give you an idea what to expect, and they try to make it up to you. In PAris, I was in the next batch getting ready to board a ride when it (apparently) broke. They Left us sitting there. After 20 minutes they came and gestured at us to get off the ride, but still didn't explain, even when we asked whether we should wait to reboard. It was almost forty minutes before someone told us that we should leave the building. To make matters worse, when I reported this to Disneyland Paris, their response was  Customer safety is our top priority. In general, the rides are pale versions of what we have in the states, again with mostly the name only intact. For instance, the Indiana Jones ride in California is a state of the art motion simulator with amazing special effects. The Indiana Jones ride in Paris is a cheap roller coaster with painted flats for scenery.Overall, this park is the equivalent of the cheaper theme parks in the US. The Disney name does not belong on it. If you go, be forewarned.",Disneyland_Paris
199750766,2,2014-3,United Kingdom,"Paris Disney is expensive to eat if you can find a place that is 1 open and 2 not fully booked.Even though we bought prepaid meal vouchers at   21 per person we could not find anywhere in the park to eat on the first day and had to go out of the park and had to spend another   60 on top of the   114 we had already paid for a two course mediocre meal and two of the smallest glasses of wine you have ever seen.When we tried to complain we were met by the normal for france 'Gallic shrug'.We have complained to Disney who say that even if you prepay they may not have a meal for you and shut restaurants if the park is not busy. Which begs the question 'Disney know how many vouchers they have sold, so they should be able to estimate the number of places they need open to service those vouchers. My suggestion is put it down to experience and make a pack lunch at breakfast to make sure you don't go hungry, take a knife and bags crisps, biscuits and drinks a kettle coffee and tea and a few small containers of milk from B & M.Having been to Disney in Orlando, Disney Paris sucks.",Disneyland_Paris
199724477,5,2013-6,India,"Great and a memorable day. Always had a fun at disney. Easy access if you are staying at Paris. Take a Subway to the park which cost around 10 euro for one for return journey and park access is about euro 120 for one person for single day. But the experience is mesmerising. Must stay for fireworks and evening prade. If you visit to Paris, must visit Eiffel tower, Champ Ellipse street and Disney land.",Disneyland_Paris
199692872,4,2014-4,United Kingdom,"If you are staying in a Disney hotel, you have the advantage of getting into the Park early, from 9 am and this can be a real bonus. Although the other three Lands are closed, Fantasyland will be open, and you can ride Dumbo, Peter Pan, etc before the lines get too long. An early start to the day is the key to enjoying your stay. At about 10 am, the roped off lands will be open, and you can head for Frontierland and get fastpass for the Big Thunder Mountain ride. It's a wonderful ride and always busy, but the line is really tedious, it takes ages. It's one ride where fastpass is essential. The other advantage of staying in a Disney Hotel is that you get some fastpass tickets given to you, per day, but you can't use them between 1pm and 4pm. Of the four lands, there are rides that are always quite quick, and those that are unbearably slow. Fast moving rides include Snow White, Pinocchio, Pirates of the Caribbean, Buzz Lightyear. The slowest rides are Dumbo, Orbitron ( only go on this one if it really has no line, otherwise it takes forever!) Phantom Manor. By noon, everything clogs up. It is so busy, you might want to go and have lunch, or even leave the park, to do something else or rest up. You can always plan to come back into the park. There is a parade at 3 or 4 pm, and the crowds tend to plot up early, then, irritatingly, if you have staked a claim on a tiny piece of pavement for half an hour, some other family decides to come and stand right in front of you. Dont be polite here, as queuing isn't often as honourable as it is the UK and the USA . You need to channel your sterner side!! The parade will always pass into or out of the gates just below  It's a Small World  so you could go up as if going on the ride, but then stand at the green railings to have a good view of the parade. The food in the Park is mostly burgers and hot dogs, if you have a decent breakfast at the Hotel, bring  extra  rolls and pastries for a useful snack mid  morning, and lunch then isn't too much of a pressing issue. Videopolis is very good for sitting down for a while, especially if the weather is bad. You can order food, but you can also sit and gather your senses as it is huge, has toilets, and lots of tables. Two things struck me this time, as a veteran of this Park. Firstly, the Snow White ride, which is basically a ride through the story of Snow White, seemed to have speeded up to an almost ridiculous degree, you could hardly see the scenery, and everyone literally felt dizzy as the ride had gone so fast! It used to go at a leisurely pace?? Secondly. I was shocked at how short the Parade had become! It used to be at least 30 minutes, with gorgeous elaborate floats and dancers, so many princesses.... now, it lasts about 5 minutes, then the rope appears and that's it! It has occurred to me, therefore that Disneyland might be making some cuts. This would be a great shame, but we all noticed, and we have been coming to these Parks for 15 years, on and off.However,it really is what dreams are made of, especially for the younger ones. But, it gets so busy and that can result in tears and frustrations (and that's just the adults) especially at Christmas and busy times. Just plan ahead, and the golden rule is, and always will be   get there early, get there early Oh, and I have a tip about the best place to take a picture of your beloved kids outside the Castle. As you walk out of Adventureland, there is a small deserted area the gives a great and uninterrupted view of the castle. Plonk the kids in front and hey presto!",Disneyland_Paris
199681541,4,2014-3,Romania,"We loved it! My 6 y.o. pushed her limits beyond imaginable and stayed awake from 7.30 to 23.00 just to catch the fireworks. She was so excited and happy. Her fav were Pirates of Caribbean ride , Buzz Lighter and Autopia. She refused to try Mad Hatter's Tea Cups and Dumbo the Flying Elephant, possibly because we have similar attractions at a local park. She didn't like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, a bit too scary(but she enjoyed the pirates ride). We plan to return in a couple of years, to check Ratatouille and other attractions she wasn't allowed to.I recommend anyone to stay at one of the Disney hotels in the park, the extra hours were extremely helpful for us. Also after the fireworks we returned to the hotel within minutes.",Disneyland_Paris
199643956,4,2014-3,United Kingdom,"Magical day out, after going to Florida 7 times already I was a bit nervous about going here but the magic was still there. Went on Saturday for my Birthday, very impressed. The only downside was a couple of the rides were down for refurb but there was plenty there to do and see. Food prices are expensive but that is Disney for you, might be worth taking in your own lunch but if you do it might be easier to put your bag through the scanning machine's, instead of getting it checked by one of the workers. The staff were very helpful and the park was very clean.",Disneyland_Paris
199631375,5,2014-3,United States,"My husband could speak some French but I couldn't speak any fortunately everyone there speaks English. Everyone was friendly,the park was clean and easy to navigate.

199627027,4,2014-3,Switzerland,"If you can go in low season is the best, so you do not have to spend hours in the lines to enter the games.

199557951,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"Loved it, everything was brilliant, dreams was amazing and something we will never forget. The park was clean, tidy, and well maintained. Extra magic hours meant we could get to the rides that usually had huge queues when they opened at 10am, after doing the other rides that were open. Brilliant place, but I would recommend a few days there, not just one! We did 5 days between both parks and still didn't see everything!",Disneyland_Paris
199549643,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,Being someone that suffers with anxiety I never thought I would copy at Disney. How wrong could I be! I can't express how much fun we had. All the cliches are true.

199502828,5,2014-4,United Kingdom,"Great Park   we managed to cover everything we wanted to within the 2 days. Take advantage of getting in early at 8.00am if you are staying at a Disney Hotel as you can get some good photos before the masses rrive as well as access to a limited number of rides   such as Buzz Lightyear (good for adults and the younger kids) and Space mountain (probably the most adult ride in the Park). Thunder Mountain was another favourite of ours. Queues are annoying but inevitable, longest we had to wait was around 45mins, but try to take advantage of the Fast pass system as much as possible. The Park itself it more compact than I'd expected, making it easy to get around the different areas without too much of a rush. Highlight for me was the Park Closing show   I must admit after a few long and tiring days I wasnt sure I was going to bother watching a few fireworks but we did and Im glad we did as it was a trult spectacular light show   try and position yourself centrally in front of the castle for the best view but be prepared to sit on the pavement for a good hour.I wasn't too impressed with the haunted Manor ride, found it a little dull but aside from that everything we went on was great. The meet and greet for the Disney characters are good if your kids are keen to get their photo and autograph with them but expect long waits for these   good in some respects as the characters dont rush things and are happy to spend a little time with each visitor while getting their photos taken but it can lead to long queues as a result.Food in the Park isnt cheap but acceptable (approx 12 Euros for burger, fries, drink and desert). Definitely worth the visit and offers something for everyone.",Disneyland_Paris
199446791,5,2014-3,United States,"We have recently returned from our first visit with our two little girls aged 3 & 4. We went by Eurostar from Ashford as we didn't want to have to get the kids and luggage across London ( we live in S.Wales ) so drove up the day before and stayed in Premier Inn near station. Great location as the was a cinema next to hotel and a choice of restaurants too so got us all in holiday mood. Eurostar itself was painless and the fact that you collected all your Disney passes and vouchers before boarding was one less headache too. And here's tip no 1) book Disney Express!! This allows you to dump your luggage on arrival at Disneyland station and head straight into park. It's then waiting in your room when you eventually go to your hotel. On departure you just leave your luggage with hotel staff and the collect it at the station before getting back on the train. Brilliant.The park itself is very clean and the park staff pretty friendly although for the most part the tourists themselves seem to dump their manners by the park gates especially when racing to see a character!! Tip no 2) take a stroller. We bought a 2nd hand double one before we went after reading some advice on here and it was a godsend. The ones for hire reminded me of something me and mates made as kids to race downhill , ie rickety, not waterproof and hugely uncomfortable. And all for    15 a day!! Believe me if your kids can fit in a stroller you will be grateful you took one. We also took a bike lock too to which meant we could leave it for hours at a time while we queued for rides or ate. Talking of eating tip 3) take lots of your own food for the kids ( and yourselves ) . We filled one of girls trunkies with snacks and even took a jar of peanut butter and a pack of butter (there was a fridge mini bar in room ) and some rolls. It is daylight robbery eating in parks and whilst the signs say you aren't to take your own food in our bags were searched every day and nothing was ever said or taken from us. Tip 4) is look for the free half board vouchers booking incentives. We had this and I reckon it saved us about   250 over the 3 nights we were there. I'm not sure it would be value to actually pay for them though but if you are able to take advantage of the deal the try to.In terms of restaurants this goes hand in hand with Tip 5) if you want to see characters without queueing for hours then book a meal at Cafe Mickey and if you want to see Princesses then book the meal at that restaurant. The food is shocking   it was inedible at the Princess meal  but the kids had the best time at both places and that's what you go for isn't it?As for meeting characters outside of the restaurants it seemed a bit of pot luck to be honest. The best place we found was at 12 noon in Walt Disney Studios where it seemed that half a dozen characters or more all appeared at once outside the Disney Junior Live studio. My final tip is specific to our accommodation the Sequoia Lodge. Tip 6) if you are staying here upgrade to Forest Garden rooms. This entitles you to breakfast in a more exclusive lounge and to much faster check in and departure too. You also get characters at breakfast. The breakfast queues for other guests in the main restaurant were ridiculous whilst we never waited more than a few minutes for a table and there was never a queue at the buffet itself.All in all I would thoroughly recommend Disney Eurostar and the Sequoia Lodge Hotel but be prepared to do a lot of waiting in line and expect to be fleeced whenever you want to eat.",Disneyland_Paris
199411364,4,2013-7,India,"The park does have a great variety of rides but u hardly feel like ur actually in Disneyland. Regular rides, Not many Disney characters to play with! Food options are quite limited. Very pricey. Impossible to see everything in a day though.",Disneyland_Paris
199367108,5,2014-3,United Kingdom,"Just back from 4 days at Disney Paris and we re all still buzzing. Dont let the miserable reviewers put you off, some people eh? Yes its busy, yes its terribly expensive , (a bottle of water is   2.50.), yes its exhausting but its also brilliant fun, beautiful to look at and very clean and professionally run. We went on every open ride and to every show except the Dumbo ride for kids which had the longest queue. Most of the other rides had waiting times of 15 minutes, fast pass helped sometimes to shorten that to 10 minutes. Most rides were probably ideal for 9 years old and up, ie a little scary but not too much. Only Space Mountain, Rock n Roll Coaster and perhaps Tower of Terror were a little challenging.Older teens might find them lame...We loved the shows, Animagique, Stitch was hilarious, Moteurs was exciting,Disney Juniors for kids. The food was massively overpriced and average. Macdonalds in Disney Village is better value as there were meal deals but I hate Mcdonalds so not for us! The parades were fun and Disney Dreams at 8pm was a stunning end to our day. This place is huge and we walked at least 5 miles every day. I dont think a 1 day visit would give you enough time to see everything even in 1 park . We did 2.5 days in Disneyland Park and 1.5 days in Walt Disney Studios. We never saw any litter but the continentals do like to smoke their Gitanes or Camels right in your face....The shops are great to wander around but yes expensive . We had a brilliant family holiday , our ten year old enjoyed everything about the park and even I , king of complainers , smiled all day....especially when I met Goofy. Meet and greets were available with all the animals in Main Street every day, there were queues for about 20 mins, we got lucky and chanced upon Goofy, Minnie, Pluto, Stitch and Chip n Dale in a quiet corner with no one around. Dont let the complainers put you off, Disney is an awesome, expensive, once in a lifetime experience that every family should do once...My final piece of advice is make a map plan before you go or you ll miss things out...",Disneyland_Paris

That makes it the most expensive Disney we visited, as we also went to California (2013) and Hong Kong (2012). Although it had the usual fun Disney rides, decorum, parade etc., there were some major letdowns: 1) limited food choice (most restaurants had only three standard fast food meals) and mediocre food especially for France2) lack of Disney characters; yes they were in the parade but during the day we could only find Mickey locked in his house (at least one hour wait) and just one (!) princess locked in the princess domain (at least one and a half hour wait, and this was the least busy day, 5 minute wait for all rides). We didn't bother, since we had great photos with characters at other Disneys.3) expensive stores; e.g. 60 90 Euro for a regular Disney princess dress, are you kidding me?4) the Disney train only visits each station every 45 minutes or so (not worth the wait)",Disneyland_Paris

But if you are a big Disney fan, as is my family, or you want to compare the European parks with the US then have at it. No discounts we were able to find here including Military discount, so expect to pay full price. The park is small enough that is it's not busy you can probably do both parks in one day, so it might be worth paying the extra    10 for park hopper. We were there in late march on a nice, but cool day. Not used to doing Disney with scarves and gloves. Lines were short, but a number of attractions were closed and many restaurants were closed. They didn't appear to have a handout telling you which restaurants were closed. We knew the attractions by checking online ahead of time. Apparently there's a free app, but of course you need European data to use it. Also be prepared for smoking in all outdoor areas. Less walking than Orlando because it's smaller. Some attractions are better than elsewhere, some not quite as good. Surprisingly, not quite as clean as the usual Disney experience we are used to, but overall still quite good.",Disneyland_Paris

198731456,5,2014-3,United Kingdom,"Thanks to all the forum members who helped before the trip with invaluable hints and tips. We (DH, DS, DDIL, DGD) have just returned from our first trip to DLP   three days and two nights in the park. Travelled with family for DGD fourth birthday. M20 closed because of bad crash overnight but traffic diversions in place and we got there in plenty of time. Travel on Eurotunnel faultless   would not have known we were moving if we hadn't looked out of the window   10 10 for our driver.Drive to the park great, on Sunday roads were very quiet.Upgraded to Golden Forest Lounge in Sequoia Lodge Hotel. Own reception for check in and this was very efficient. They reserved table by the river in Blue Lagoon restaurant but couldn't book PFAD   we had to do this in person. Adjoining rooms on sixth floor   facing over the front of the hotel   might have been better to have view over the water? Didn't have much time to look at the view tbh. Rooms were ok   clean and had everything we required. Off to the Disneyland Hotel to book PFAD. We had never been to the park or to this hotel before and it's not clear where to enter. There are no signs anywhere but lots of helpful people to ask   FYI it's far right hand side revolving door as you approach the park. Lovely hotel, helpful staff in the shop and thankfully booked for the next day at 10.40. As DGD is 4 we spent a lot of time in and around the childrens rides in Fantasyland. We did the Carousel de Lancelot, Casey Junior, It's a small world, Alice's curious labyrinth, dumbo, teacups, Le pats des Contes de Fees and lots of others that I don't know the names of. Weather was cold and wet, bought ponchos to watch the Parade. Fabulous, even in the rain. Dinner at Blue Lagoon was great and we did Pirates ride straight after   DGD loved it too. Disney dreams was completely amazing   was at 10pm as park closed at 10 on Sunday.Breakfast in Golden Forest Lounge was good   continental, v busy but fun. Lots of characters   Mickey, Goofey (who shook his head when I called him Pluto   oops but he tickled my neck   what fun). Didn't quite appreciate the excitement the characters would create but the kids loved it. Even us big ones. PFAD   fabulous. Hair, makeup, dress, photos   it was wonderful. Her hair was still in a princess bun when we drove home last night! I was concerned that we wouldn't get a booking but there wasn't a problem. I think the park was quieter than normal? We didn't wait more than 20 minutes to get on any ride   even when we did rides on our own like Big Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain. We ate at lucky nugget saloon in Frontierland on Monday for lunch. Band was playing too which was fun. Some restaurants in our half board plus package were closed (Walts   sign outside said restaurants close by that were open so we went to Silver Spur steak house which was also closed but we found others anyway   all part of the adventure! We also forgot DGD pass when we went to Blue Lagoon so we paid then got refund next day. On Monday evening we went to see the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show   just fantastic entertainment. Would highly recommend. We went to the early show and got into the park for the end of Disney Dreams   park much busier on Monday and we watched from Town square and then walked back to our hotel   which was about 5   10 minutes away. Last day spent going around the rides again   no queues to speak of   it was cold and wet which may have contributed to that. Lots of shopping on Main Street. Our last lunch was in Cafe Mickey   what fun. Must have been 10 birthdays when we were there. Mickey, Goofy, Chip and Dale, Geppetto and Tigger all came round. Great! All home safely last night   drive back to Calais was good   roads quiet. Very efficient checkin at Eurotunnel. We live in London so were grateful to get to M20 after 7pm when traffic was quieter. Food everywhere was ok   we thought of it mainly as fuel to tell you the truth. Some meals were ok, a couple were good. DLP isn't a gastronomic experience but you won't starve   top marks go to the profiteroles in Cafe Mickey.If DLP could do one thing to improve the experience it would be to ensure smokers smoke in designated areas. People just smoke everywhere and there are hundreds (obvs!) of kids around. It was quite unpleasant sometimes especially waiting for the parade and at the fireworks.

198603536,1,2014-3,Canada,"We visited Paris Disney on the last day of our Paris trip. We had read that it was in disrepair and 'not up to Disney Standard.'. We've visited all of the Disney parks in the US. We're Canadian so this should be somewhat neutral. Obviously, we didn't go to Paris to go to Disney, it was a last minute, 'why not' visit.The Good: Not busy. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was much better than the US version. The wrap up laser show at the castle was really cool. The Aerosmith ride was neat but short.The Bad: Everything Else.We didn't notice any surface wear on the park aside from a lot of litter and trash on and around the rides. What we did notice was closed rides and breakdowns with no notice. Indian Jones and Crush's Coaster we're both closed with no forewarning. The Armegedon effects show only runs on Thursday's... What? Tower of Terror broke down when we were on it, the motion on the platform was broken on the Studio Tour as well as many of the effects in the haunted house were not working (hitch hiking ghosts). Every second car in the Buzz Lightyear ride was out of order, covered with a blue tarp. We also noticed many restraint issues with people being either unable to get out of the harness or unable to get the restraint to secure them. As an aside, Space Mountain was so violent that it felt like we were in a car wreck after. Other people complained, two staff members rode alone and came back shrugging. The staff were uninterested and not in character. Photo pass didn't exist and we never saw a single Disney character in costume.Ultimately, the kids had fun (16,15 & 12). This is most we've ever paid for Disney and the least value. If you get a discounted ticket, it would be a good day. If you pay full freight you will likely be disappointed.",Disneyland_Paris
198524705,1,2013-12,United Kingdom,"Disneyland was a big disappointment for our family!We visited Disneyland Paris on Sunday 29th December 2013WE spent a total of 8 hours in this place...and our two grandchildren aged 8 & 6 only managed to get onto 3 rides during the whole of that timeThe rest of the day was spent STANDING IN LINE for those 3 rides...in very cold conditionsThere were, in our view TOO MANY PEOPLE INTHE PARK for the amount of rides availableChidren do NOT enjoy standing in the cold for hour after hour to then go on a ride which only lasts for between 1 & 2 minutesThe catering arrangements were shockingly poor ...nowhere to sit...food ranges very limittedDisneyland is all about cramming as many people in and getting as much money as possible out of them as possibleDisneyland...you need to either limit the amount af people in the park at any one time, OR build more attractions OR expand the attractions that you already have there...because YOU are failing to provide a good and enjoyable experience for childrenIf you have ever been to Brighton, uk, I would say that BRIGHTON PIER represents much better experience for childrens enjoyment...without the cost or the hours or waitingDISNEYLAND PARIS.....WHAT A DUMP !!",Disneyland_Paris
198435962,4,2014-3,United States,"Our 3rd trip to DLP was very good, much improved since our last trip 5 years ago. Staff seem more 'on board' and more into the Disney spirit. Some rides closed but waiting time in most rides less than anticipated, especially Big Thunder Mountain (get in the left hand lane if the queue, much quicker). Parade was very good as always. Plenty of opportunities to meet characters around the park too.Coffee and cookies from the kiosks in Main Street were lovely.",Disneyland_Paris

198320419,4,2014-3,United Kingdom,"Just got back from 5 days 4 nights Mon   Fri at Hotel Cheyenne at Disney and apart from food prices and choice was the best holiday we have ever had! Got 2 kids aged 10 and 6 and everything ran like clockwork   from Disney Express at St Pancras to   well   everything! All the staff were lovely, very little or no queues for rides and the weather was brilliant. The longest queue we had was 50 mins for the Tower of Terror but thereafter max time waiting was 30 mins for anything and one morning we were getting off the Space Mountain running round and getting straight back on! We did every single open ride in both parks at least once (Thunder Mountain 5 times, Tower of Terror 3 times, Space Mountain 7 times) never needed to get a fast pass for anything. Took a day trip into Paris on Thursday and that was good too. It is very clean, no litter. Shame that the food is so expensive and its hell to find a piece of fruit or a vegetable but really for a few day, what the heck! The parade and dreams shows are wonderful. If you can't have a good time at Disney then stay at home!!",Disneyland_Paris

It is truly magical, though it is expensive.You turn into a child again, everyone has so much fun, no matter what your age is! There is always something to do whether it is the rides, the food, the shops, hot air balloon ride, taking pictures and autographs of the disney characters, everything.You don't even know where the time goes, the day flies by. It is truly magical and something everyone should experience, especially those with children younger siblings.",Disneyland_Paris
198183772,3,2014-3,United Kingdom,"OK it was March but there was limited places open to get a coffee without walking back to main street. A lot of refurbishment going on and rides closed. We had pre bought the full board meal plan which was good as costly to eat in the park, but the downside of this was the limited options burgers, chicken or beef chips, chips, chips, and either burger fish or chicken nuggets for children. No Veg in sightThere was also a great lack of charactures walking about the park. The only way to  meet  them was to buy the Characture Meals at Cafe Mickey, which we felt was dissapointing, my kids (25 &27) remembered previous trips where the charactures were always about. Don't think I am moaning we had a great time, but at times it felt the magic only happened with money.",Disneyland_Paris

We had arranged 3 days in the park, but after 2 days, we decided enough was enough and spent the third day in Paris. Even with good use of Fast Pass, it would be a struggle to do all the rides in one day. Park is very clean and all staff are great, rides are good although none are hardly thrill rides for regular theme park visitors.",Disneyland_Paris

198069386,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"The attention to detail in these parks are breathtaking. Every corner and nook and cranny have had a little bit of fairy dust sprinkled on to them. It is expensive, there is no getting around that. There are some brilliant deals to be had though, so shop around. a 4 day 2park pass is around 105 euros I think. But when you think that an adult ticket for one day at Alton Towers can be   45, I think Disney is good value.The queues can be long, especially for the family favourites like Big Thunder Mountain and Peter Pan's Flight. But there are FastPass options available which, unlike the theme parks in the UK, are free and these can make a huge difference in the amount of time spent queuing.People complain about the cost and quality of the theme park food but I'm not sure what they expect? It's the same in every theme park around the world, or every big city etc. You're paying for the location more than anything and surely it's not the end of the world if chips are the staple of the diet for a couple of days. Plus, if you're willing to go into Disney Village for food, Earl of Sandwich will give you a chip free meal, McDonalds is cheaper than the burger and chip joints inside the park and King Ludwigs offers nice food but a decent price.To go to Disneyland Paris, is to know you're going to spend the equivalent to a week long family holiday in a couple of days. To pay high prices for ok ish food and to spend at least some of your time waiting in line. If you understand this, you'll find that it is also a place to take you right back to being a child again, to watch the amazement on your childs face as they meet their Disney hero's in person, to see a world class night time show in Dreams, to see a park that pays a ridiculous amount of attention to detail, to make memories that last a life time and finally, to know that this isn't a place like Thorpe Park or Alton towers where you're literally going for the thrill rides, at Disney, you go for the whole unique experience. Have a magical time.",Disneyland_Paris
198064757,3,2014-3,United Arab Emirates,"Had the chance to spend about 5 hours here on a short trip to Paris.For anyone who likes Disney, the park itself is nicely laid out, the areas are themed nicely and there seems to be a good variety of things for different ages.However, a few things lessened the experience for me.I only used the restrooms once , believe me that was enough. They were absolutely disgusting. I didn't see any attendants anywhere. Broken toilets, broken dryers, smelt bad, wet floors... They really should have cleaning staff with the amount of traffic they were getting.The Princess Pavilion was a massive let down. As an adult I can hack waiting if I know something will be worth it. Not sure about little kids. I was told the wait would be about 60mins. The cast member on the door told me it would be worth waiting as there were 3 Princesses in attendance and we could take pictures with all three. This is not the case. After 90mins of waiting, I was told only one Princess could be met, and they wouldn't tell us (even when next in the queue) which three Princesses were there. I got Ariel. The little kids in front of me we crushed when they realised they got a different Princess than they were hoping for. Bear this in mind if you go with kids. You don't know who'll you get. Considering that I spent maybe 40sec max with Ariel, it shouldn't have been an issue to let people take pics quickly with each one. It's a shame they can't just give each Princess or pair of Princesses a seaparate area so you don't waste time queuing for one you're not particularly interested to see.... e.g at least have the three classics (Cinderella, Snow & Aurora) in one building and the newer ones in their own to make it easier and shorter queuesOnto the good  I agree Space Mountain 2 was easily worth it. Wait was only 5 minutes! I also liked the Buzz Lightyear Ride which was fun for me as a grown up and seemed to be enjoyed by the kids that I saw. It's interactive so you participate rather than just sit and watch.Scenery is nice, the buildings, small details like posters on the walls and trash bins decorated. I never made it past Fantasyland and Discoveryland so can't tell you anything about the rest of the park. Indiana Jones is closed until May. All the main rides aside from Space Mountain were closed during my visit (Crush's Coaster, Captain EO etc) so check the schedule.I did enjoy myself but not quite to the level I expected. Makes me want to try one of the other parks rather than return to this one.",Disneyland_Paris
197959375,3,2014-3,United States,"I've been to all the Disney Parks in the world, and this is probably the most disappointing.First the good   the Space Mountain ride here is more intense than other parks' version. It's definitely the highlight if you have older kids, or want something more exciting.The park was really crowded the day I was there. The wait estimates were terribly bad in a few rides. The Indiana Jones ride was closed. The Thunder Mountain Railroad closed repeatedly. And even the Buzz Lightyear Laser thing had problems. We wanted to ride the circling railroad at 6pm, and was told that it was closed too. On top of that, service was typically French, with an attitude. Wait for lunch at Videopolis was ridiculously long   about 20 minutes. French don't serve ice with cold drinks. When I asked for ice, I got a dirty look for server. When we asked for fruit cup instead of fries, we got another dirty look, even though the menu clearly says you have a choice. The dance at Videopolis was quite amateurish, and not very good.There are only 3 attractions for older kids here, and 2 of 3 were closed that day. The other strange thing is that at almost all the rides, you see people cutting using the handicapped lane. While some looked handicapped, many don't. Instead, they hold some sort of paper. Is this some sort of VIP thing? I haven't seen this in other Disney parks.",Disneyland_Paris
197944029,4,2013-9,United Kingdom,"A lot of fun here although there were a lot of restaurants food stalls closed   I'd say this was due to the time of year though. Pan's Flight was out of use but this park was in better order than Studios. Space Mountain was a bit rough. I had a sore neck head afterwards from being thrown around. Other than that, the parade and Disney Dreams were amazing. Definately worth seeing!",Disneyland_Paris

This time some games stopped in the middle (roller coaster & mountain train) and people had to walk out. I guess they are lacking some maintenance. Nevertheless we really enjoyed it. Stayed for 2 days (1 for each park). I suggest to make it 3 days at least in order to enjoy it. I'm sure I'll go again & again.",Disneyland_Paris

Both Parks are in need of a good splash of paint and unlike the Parks in Florida   both seemed to lack that  spark  .... also we felt the staff did not have the same approach, they were lacking in their interaction with the public.

From rides to shows, parades to fireworks everything about Disney is special for the littles ones!! The light shows & parades are just brilliant!! What a place!!

But, came away disappointed. 3 of the 1st four rides I went on were missing things or had things broken during the ride. . It seems like this park isn't kept up to the standards as the American parks. I do like the wide open spaces it has compared to the other two. Lots more room to walk.

197719991,2,2014-3,Spain,"We have just returned from Disneyland Paris and I am sure it would have been cheaper to go to America. Disney have you over a barrel as once on site there is nothing else around, they charge 2,89euro for a 500ml bottle of water. You can buy a litre for 49cents if you have the time to get on the RER and go to the nearest shopping centre. A meal without starter or dessert costs in the region of 75 euro for 2 adults and a 3 yr old. Even the Disney hotels charge an ridiculous amount for drinks with no coffee or tea making facilities in the rooms. Okay so your getting Disney magic without an 8 9 hour flight but it seems to me there is no need for Disney to take every penny from you. Water and food, basic human needs should not cost the earth. They do like in America have water fountains by the toilets, however, every time I tried one they didn't work.To me Disneyland Paris appears to be about how much money they can make from you while you are there having enticed you with cheap deals such as the one we went on, 2 nights free.... We stayed at the Sequoia lodge, the bathroom smelled of wee. My husband assured me its because there are small tiles on the floors and it absorbs into the grout not that it isn't cleaned. Breakfast was typical continental but so busy on occasion there were no bowls or plates and no fruit salad. So its difficult to even fill up before you go to the parks.If you are thinking of going to Disneyland Paris I would suggest you have a huge contingency fund for basic needs, or in fact fill your case with water!!",Disneyland_Paris

We got our park tickets online through FNAC stores and saved so much money compared to buying at the gate on the day (paid 49 euros each, with free child place as opposed to 80 & 70 euros at gate). Make sure you get to see the stunt show in the studio, it was one of the highlights of the day for us. Hope you enjoy the experience as much as we did, looking forward to going back one day.",Disneyland_Paris
197670039,5,2014-3,United Kingdom,Yes Queues.Not as Expensive as people make out. Great Fun. Queues are to be expected in a park this busy and apart from Autopia all queues were very fluid and you never felt like you were having to stand still for long. Autopia was a real long queue and the ride was worth the wait. for other rides use that FastPass system where it is in place which speeds up the process. All rides we went on and that was the majority were worth wait apart from Autopia and also the Star Wars ride.Last year when went to Disney we had snow which stopped a lot of the rides but this year there was none so all the rides were up and running. We used the 2 hours extra in the park we got from staying at a Disney hotel and this made a lot of difference as we managed to get on a lot more rides in that time. Staff in the park were nothing but helpful and there were also plenty around. The food and shops are no more expensive than if you were at a them park in the UK or at a Disney store in the Uk.

The park needs a little refurbishment and certain areas needs to be cleaned properly. There were constant issues with rides breaking down throughout or 5 day stay. When I was younger it was a free for all to have a photo taken with the characters, but now the characters do not come out to take photos with people, you have to search for them and they are only available for 10 minutes which is very disappointing.

It's worth getting there early for a good seat for both. The queues are awful though. I can't imagine what they are like in the summer holidays. Must be horrific. The food is ridiculously priced and we always took our own. And the smoking in the park is vile. Why aren't there smoking areas?

Each shop in the park have a different offer on, one of the shops were selling a large blanket with all the characters on it for just 10 euros!.the parades and the light show at the end of the day are a must see, but do try get down there early to get a good view!.the rides in the studios are brilliant ! although having to wait atleast on hour to get on each thing it is worth it in the end, the rockin rollercoaster is amazing, even better if your a fan of aerosmith!. The car show in the studios is also a must see, the stunts are brilliant and they really make you feel like you are watching the making of a movie.when the park is closed at night, the disney village is still open till late, there is many great places to eat, bars and shops. the rainforest cafe is amazing! really fast service and the staff are very freindly.overall there is nothing i can say bad about our holiday at disney, we had a fantastic time and would go back right now!!!",Disneyland_Paris

Some rides had long queues but if you use the fast passes were possible this makes it alot easier and quicker. We found all the staff and crew members to be very friendly and had no problems with them or anyother people waiting in line for rides or shows as i would not have taken kindly to anyone pushing my child or pushing in line to get a head in the queues, but we did not see any of this rudness thankfully. We would so reccommend anyone to try here for the Disney Magic who have never experienced Disney before but i still have to say nothing bets Florida Disney if you have the time or extra cash to go there instead, but as this is just a short flight away it is so worth it to get that Disney Fix.",Disneyland_Paris

There were queues but they were well organised & you can bypass them with fast passes if they're available(sometimes they weren't). The parades & evening light show is a must. If you have young children either go early or wait until later   they won't manage both as there's lots of walking & standing. Take a buggy if u have under 6's   they can be left around the park quite safely although some people had bike locks which is a good idea if you've an expensive one. Food & drink is expensive so if you can get a half board deal when you book it's worth paying extra up front. Officially you're not allowed to take food & drink in, but if you go through the bag scanning aisle they don't check unless you have cans.

196737672,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"Spent 6 days 5 nights at the Disneyland Paris resort. We stopped at the Sante Fe hotel, which is on the site and is a Disney Hotel.This hotel can not really be faulted   it offers a comfortable base for the resort. The breakfast is fairly basic but high quality and as it is a buffet, there is no limit to how much you can eat. Recommend that you get to breakfast when it opens, not only to give you more time in the park, but to miss the rush   if you go much after 8am, you have to wait a while for some space to clear in the breakfast area (which is huge)Hotel is fairly quiet and the room we stopped in had recently been redecorated in a Cars theme   very good. Room can not be faulted   has a TV, safe and a kettle on request   beds are huge and pretty comfortable.The location of the hotel means its about a 15 minute walk to the Disney Village   basically the first part of the resort. Disney LandThe main park is open from 8 for Disney Hotel guests, and its well worth the effort to get up and to the park by this time   guests get 2 hours before the  day  visitors can enter.Inside the park there are a multitude of rides to suit all   some are excellent and very popular, with the corresponding queue later in the day. Its worth heading for the most popular rides in the 2 hour window before the paying public get in   maximise the short queue's !The real downside to the whole Disney experience is the total rip off prices charged for Food and Drink   you are a  captive  audience and they take full advantage of that   2 kids meals (pasta, drink, ice cream) and one adult meal (Lasagne, garlic bread and a drink) work out at about 30 euros (at lunch time)   the evening meals are even more   60 Euros for the basics. I do not really  do  McDonalds   but to put it in perspective, there is a McDonalds in the Disney Village   we had our evening meal there one night (Kids Happy Meal, Adult meal and a Big Mac Meal) and it cost 18 Euros. ONE Basic Burger at somewhere like Planet Hollywood (also in Disney Village) was 17 Euros.But the biggest disappointment was eating at Caf   Mickey   we had been there before on several previous visits and I always considered it to be quite expensive but have really good quality food. This time it was more expensive and you did not even get a side plate, a glass for Kids drink and the food was terrible   but, the experience of the characters visiting your table helped greatly !The other area of Disney Land Paris is the studios   almost a separate park. The rides here are mixed, with some brilliant ones (RC Racer for example), but these get the queues. There are also lots of film based shows etc. The studio part of the park is ideal if there is inclement weather   you can generally find a show or indoor attraction to keep dry warm.6 days is a long enough time to fully explore both parks and other than the price of the food drink, the whole experience is well worth it   and be warned, walking around for 6 days is very tiring!Disney, get your pricing sorted on the food drink and this would easily be a 5 star attraction",Disneyland_Paris

Weekends are busy no matter what time of year so avoid these. Bring dome snacks keep kids occupied in queues. If going in winter months, prep for all weather.

196510394,2,2014-3,United Kingdom,"For 81 Eur per day per person one might have high expectations...My main issue is that too many people are allowed in, resulting in attraction waiting times between 45 min and 2.5r hours... I believe this is way too much. Your day consists of 90 % waiting in queues.... Children get bored, nothing is done to keep people in queues entertained...So overall I don't think it is worthwhile going mostly because of the long queues....",Disneyland_Paris
196450964,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"We visited as a family of 5 (children aged 8, 5 and 23 months) Monday to Friday during the last week of February. Having read the reviews by other people who visited during the same month I have to say we had a completely different experience, certainly we didn't experience any significant queue waiting times. The popular rollercoaster type rides will always have long queues, but the biggest wait we had was about an hour for the Big Thunder Mountain train ride. I rode Space Mountain during the Extra Magic Hours (the park is open at 8am for hotel guests and 10am for the general public) and the queue was about 10 minutes. So a good piece of advice is to try and get into the parks for the extra two hours if at all possible because the queues are not too bad at that time. It's only certain rides, in Fantasyland and Discoveryland, that are open. Frontierland and Adventureland remain roped off until 10am even for hotel guests. And they do actually let the public in from 9:30am (so as to avoid a crush at the gates at 10am I suppose) so this means that you will need your hotel EasyPass to get into Fantasyland and Discoveryland if you are not in by that point. Our 23 month old could go on all of the rides that didn't have height restrictions, and she is small for her age. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride scared her though, it's quite dark and there are three short drops that the boat goes down. Her favourite was the Carousel ride, but one of us had to stand next to her on the ride. The rules are that children should be able to reach the footrest on the horse, if they can't they have to move to a smaller horse or you have to stand next to them. I didn't ever see an adult and a child on the same horse so I don't think they allow this. It's definitely worth visiting Disneyland Paris with under 3's, they might not remember much but they won't be left in the pushchair all day while their older siblings go on all the rides. The Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast ride is really good, the queue times were about half an hour but the queue is constantly moving (the ride has a high capacity) so it doesn't feel too bad. Again, our youngest went on that ride. I didn't enjoy Space Mountain, I could not persuade my 8 year old to go on but it's probably a good job he didn't because I forgot that it goes upside down and is very dark. The first bit of the ride, where you are shot up the slope, is brilliant but after that the ride shakes you around a lot and I spent the whole ride just thinking  ow, this is hurting my head ! I was pushing my head back into the headrest, as advised on the ride, but still found it uncomfortable and won't go on that again. The Dreams show at the end of the day is fantastic. It was on at 8pm during February, but as the year goes on it eventually ends up being 11pm at the height of the summer which would be far too late for my children and I would not have let them stay out that late (mean, I know, but they are little horrors after just one late night and it would have spoiled the rest of the holiday). We ate at the Plaza Gardens buffet one night, the food was lovely but it was a bit busy at 5:30 so you had to queue for food instead of just being able to walk up and get to any part of the buffet. There was lots of variety, with salads veg fruit available. We only bought lunch one day in this park, we went to the Hyperion Cafe in Videopolis (Discoveryland) and again the food was good quality (pre packed salads, plus burger chicken nugget type food), plus they show cartoons which is good if you just need half an hour's peace from the kids! If you are taking younger children on the Big Thunder Mountain ride then you need to warn them that the first part of the ride is in the dark (you go under the lake to come out on the island where the main part of the track is), there is a dark part in the middle of the ride and again you have to come back under the lake to get off the ride. The Princess Pavillion, where you can meet a princess, is worth a visit (but maybe I'm just saying that because we only had a 45 minute wait!). You only get to spend maybe 2 or 3 minutes with the Princess, you don't get a choice but if it is your second or subsequent visit they will ask who you have met on previous visits and try to make sure you see a different one. There is an 'official' photographer, who will give you a ticket at the end with a barcode on so you can view the pictures at the exit, but they are perfectly happy for you to take your own pics and will stop taking theirs after a while so that the princess and your child can look at your camera. The look on my daughters face when she met Snow White was worth the entire cost of our holiday and more, I was almost in tears! We bought two of the official photos (my camera had got a bit damp in my pocket because it was raining and I could tell that my pictures were not going to come out very well) which cost    20. We had a fantastic trip, and have a perfect excuse to visit again in a couple of years because our youngest won't remember much of this trip. We booked under the 2 days 2 nights free offer, and all the children were free in the hotel and got free park tickets so I think it was good value for money. I'd definitely stick to visiting mid week during the low season, you have to take a bit of a chance with the weather but it's worth it because the parks are quieter. I must add though that our half term holiday fell a week later than most of the rest of the UK, so again that could have been why we didn't think the park was too busy. And as for the comparisons with the American Disney Parks, I think this is a bit pointless. We were completely happy with the Paris park, and it's ideal for families with younger children. I'd not want to fly to Florida just now with our youngest child, a quick trip on the Eurostar was much more manageable. All the Cast Members (Disney staff) we met were lovely, but I think they appreciated that we used some basic French (just hello goodbye and please thank you) and smiled at them. But the main thing was that our children had a good holiday, and they did. Disney can have as much of my money as they want because the children just loved everything they did and saw at the Park and their little faces just lit up every day!",Disneyland_Paris
196442683,5,2014-2,Ireland,"Very expensive both for entry and shops eating but very impressive. Very well kept and clean, informative 'cast', breathtaking beautiful castles, beauty everywhere.

196442492,5,2014-2,Norway,"My girlfriend and I went to Disneyland Paris in the end of february, it was magical! It was just like being in the aucually Disneyland. I was impressed of everything! WOW! I recomend this to everyone! It is a lot of queue, but it is so Worth it, because the park is just amazing. The fee is a little high, but it is all Worth it. We payed 150euro for two adults in both of the parks. Totaly Worth it! It was also a very helpful and friendly lugage staff. Perfect if you are like us, staying in Paris a couple of days and then visit Disneyland the last day, and then take the bus to the airport later the same day. I will recomend to be in the amusment park more than one day. It is so much to see and do.",Disneyland_Paris
196289678,3,2014-3,United Kingdom,"This attraction could have a 1 star rating on TA and still day after day, year after year, people will Q up to go and see Disney land. Such is the power of the brand. Reality is, all reviews are pretty pointless but here goes anyhow...We went with 2 kids, 5 and 7. They liked it but then this morning I went to the playground and we went crazy on some of the toys there and I think they had a better time there! The kids did love the parade and they loved the pirates and the thunder mountain. But I am simply not convinced that kids really love it. Looking around the park, watching tired parents queu up with cranky kids, made me think: why are we all here? Because we think we need to take our kids there. It has become a must. But is it really? Seeing parent after parent with bags and bags full of Disney toys and princess dresses etc etc. what a business...This was our worst experience: My little girl loves the princesses. We queued for 1 hour 20 minutes in a hot place. Finally it was our turn. We were allowed to see 1 princess, Snow White , then we were quickly ushered out. Horrible. Big disappointment. I would not go again, that is for sure.",Disneyland_Paris

However, there were quite a number of rides that weren't open, a disappointment. We went to Studios too, hence we did a lot of walking from park to park. By the end of the day, the family was pretty tired out.Stay for the fireworks show at the closing time of the park, it's well worth the wait. The show was simply magical.Overall, the family enjoyed the visit.To avoid unnecessary time waiting, you may want to consider purchasing tickets online before visiting the parks in peak season.",Disneyland_Paris

195802541,4,2013-8,Egypt,"We went to Disney Land in August. It was really wonderful. There's opening and closing shows, make sure you go really early to attend the morning one, as you will be in real rush in the closing show if you're taking the metro or the train in your ride back. First of all, I advise you to book online because the booking queues are really long, so you will save much time if you printed your tickets back home. When you get inside, get a map, it will guide you through the entire park, showing you all the games with how hard each is. Some games are suitable for young kids, so if you're a bit older, they may be boring, others are for families which are really great, not dangerous, but you get to see the amazing detail oriented designs. Also, there are difficult games that aren't suitable for children.Tip: Do not miss Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean adventures if you're a fan of the movies.Although the food is expensive, but I advise you to eat there, we ate in The Lucky Nugget Saloon. The design of the restaurant was fantastic, with live musicians performing. It was really breath taking. We paid EUR 16 which included a sandwich, fries, soft drink & sundae ice cream.Also, in the map, you will find a list of other restaurants with their estimated price range. The only bad thing about our visit was the queues we had to wait in to get into any game. There are toilets everywhere, to avoid the queues, there are toilets at the back of each women men's room, so don't get shocked when you see the toilet full of people, they probably didn't notice the row 2 toilets in the bathroom. The ticket price includes ALL the games inside.",Disneyland_Paris
195679140,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"Despite it being half term, we never queued more than 20 minutes for a ride. However the queues for the overpriced food were horrendous! If you take food  snacks in with you, use the automated baggage scanners (bit like an airport) as in the manual check queue staff members were asking people to leave their food behind. Disappointed that not one of the water fountains was working, luckily we took in enough drinks. Be prepared for a long walk to the park   even though we were in the front row of the car park, it still took 20 minutes to get to the park   not good for a child who has mobility issues and he was frequently knocked out of the way on the moving walkways. The characters were great, although queues were slow moving   it would be a better idea to have more characters at each meet and greet so children can collect more autographs.It would also be nice if adults were banned from wearing mouse ears   this spoiled a few things for my children   they couldn't see characters, things on rides etc due to several adults wearing these ears and my youngest actually got poked in the eye by the person in front of him on one ride. So glad we stayed at the Davy crockett ranch as queues for the shuttle buses were horrendous and it was nice to relax in the evenings in the peace and quite and not be tied in to meal times and overpriced food.Parks lovely and clean (although toilets a bit smelly, even at 8am in the magic hours!)Best rides were peter pan, pirates of carribean, buzz lightyear and the tea cups. The whole atmosphere was magical, the only thing that let it down were other people (mouse ears, queue jumping, pushing my children out of the way, adults holding up the queue for characters due to having ten million photos taken with them....)Will hopefully be returning in a couple of years, although this would depend on prices   we did get a good deal, but i wouldn't pay more than we did this time.",Disneyland_Paris
195669705,5,2014-2,Australia,I travelled to Disneyland with my brother and loved every minute of it. There was only one ride closed but we had so much else to do that it didn't worry us at all. The souvenirs and food were quite expensive but we expected that before we arrived. We had lunch at pizza planet. For about 20 euros there was all you can eat pizza salad and desserts. When we visited the park it was raining a little bit on and off all day. Most of the rides were indoors so it didn't really bother us at all. The park was very quiet and we didn't have to wait in line for any rides. Be aware that it is VERY COLD at the park if your not used to the cooler climate. Scarfs and gloves are essential if travelling in the colder months. The park is very easy to get to from Paris. The train goes straight to the park. Just be sure to buy the correct train ticket to get out there (not the ticket that is only valid for Paris) or wear a 66 euro fine like I did!We managed to see both parks in one day but in the busier months you will probably need two days to see everything in both parks. Well worth the money.,Disneyland_Paris

Saves a lot of money. For tea we brought tinned curry micro rice for one meal as no ovens only microwave and hob, also jacket potatoes and tinned beef bolagnase. Lots of fruit for dessert to balance out the tinned !! Saying that don't knock a tinned chicken curry after 12 hours at Disney and saving 50 euro on a meal for 4!!

After days visiting museums and landmarks in Paris, it was nice to reset with a lil touch of fun and whimsey from the good old USA. The lines were manageable, and it was nice touch of the Disney experience, but don't expect it to compare to Disneyworld in Florida, I'd say more like Disneyland in California, small and quaint, just enough to get the feel of Disney in France.",Disneyland_Paris

195412242,4,2014-2,Netherlands,"We liked that in the park the different activities had signs indicating for whom they are intended to (i.e. entire family, not for pregnant women, children of a certain age, etc.).Fantasyland station was the best site for us with a 3 and half old son, he loved all the activities, especially the little rollercoster train and the  It's a small world  boat tour.We found very convenient the stroller rental inside the park. To rent a stroller for the enitre day is Euro 15, and by leaving a deposit you can even take the strolled outside of the park, for example to the hotel.Don't miss out the 5:00pm parade and the 10:00pm show. Just leave the 10:00pm show 10 minutes in advance to avoid the big crowd heading to the exit.Keep your expectations about food down, since here eating could be just an ok experience, if you are lucky.

195353868,3,2013-9,United Kingdom,"Firstly, for the amount of money we paid, which was the cheapest we could find it, it worked out more expensive than going to Walt Disney World minus the flights. Unfortunatley we noticed problems as soon as we arrived in France.  We booked to use the disney coach to take us from the airport to the hotel. When we got to the airport we found the coach stop and it was already full with people on the pavement and on the road. There was no queue system and this resulted in some heated discussions between passengers. When a coach finally turned up we were not helped with our bags and people were pushing to get on the coach. The bag thing didn't bother me as much but I felt sorry for the families with children and prams. My boyfriend also banged his head quite hard on the boot of the coach which didn't help matters   he was simply not used to putting things in a coach! The driver would not let people on the coach unless the whole group was together so he could scan the tickets as people get on. This would have been fine if there had been someone helping with bags and there had been a queue system   people were panicing to get on as it was clear there would not be room for everyone. I could not believe it when we got on the coach and the windscreen was smashed with a piece of plastic backing stuck over the top of it. Furthermore, throughout the journey the driver was talking on his phone! I know the law might be different in France but there is simply no excuse for putting 40 peoples lives at risk just to speak to your friend. Also, he was playing his own chart music very loud. To me non of this equates to the disney magic I expected. If I compare this service to the service I received in Orlando, that is a complimentary service might I add, it does not match up on any level. When you arrive at the airport in Orlando a red carpet awaits you and you are checked in at a desk so they know you have arrived. Your bags are put on for you and taken off when you arrive at your desitination. Furthermore, there are screens on the coaches in Disney World that play an overview of what the parks and hotels are like with all the characters involved and it keeps you entertained on the 40 minute journey. Furthermore, the driver speaks to you throughout telling you where you are and how far away we are   this did not happen on the Paris coach.  The hotel was nice and the staff were pleasant  we stopped at Sequoia Lodge, but there were broken things in the room and VERY small towels. However the beds were very comfortable and there were always new toiletries provided. Also, the surroundings were absolutely stunning, we could have walked round the hotel area for ages.  In terms of the parks, the attention to detail with the restaurant and ride decors plus the walkways and different areas was what made the holiday for me the park was genuinely beautiful (in places) and made for some great pictures. However, some rides broke down four or five times and we were queuing for crazy amounts of time when the park was not at full capacity. If I again compare this to walt disney world I was there at the end of July 2012 and we did not queue for longer than 30 mins. Furthermore, the toilets were very clean as were most of the restaurants we went in. However, the outside bins were overflowing so we were stood in queues with huge wasps flying round. This would never have happened in Orlando   probably due to there very good underground bin system!The Dreams fireworks were brilliant but it was completely RUINED by people smoking standing pushing each other and myself out of the way to get the best spot. When wishes comes on in Orlando the whole thing is just more organised, no  one stands on the road   so that you can leave if you need too and everyone has enough room to be able to see. Overall, the holiday was enjoyable but it certainly depends what you make of it and I can't say I felt relaxed. People smoking in the parks nearly ruined it for me. If anyone is thinking of going to Paris I would seriously suggest that you consider saving for a bit longer and go to Orlando   they seem to care a lot more about you as a guest and really instil magic throughout your whole stay.",Disneyland_Paris
195298849,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"This is our third visit to Disneyland Paris. The first 2 were when my daughter was in her princess phase....but this time it had moved onto the bigger rides.We didn't watch any shows or parades as we have 'done' them...but if you haven't I would strongly recommend catching at least 1 parade and recommend the motor stunt show at the studios. We visited on Friday 21 Feb and although there were enough people there we thought the queues were ok. We mainly manage our rides around the fast pass system. We loved thunder mountain, space mission and quieter rides like pirates of the carribean and the toy story parachute drop. The biggest shock for us was the crush coaster in the studios. In previous years the queue has been too big but we managed to get okn it this time...we thought it was going to be a gentle ride but it certainly was not. It was 'awesome' though and probably my favourite ride. I'm glad we hadn't got onto it in previous years as it would have terrified my daughter at an earlier age, and some of the younger kids coming out of the ride looked like they were in shock.We absolutely love Disney and the only reason I haven't scored it excellent is because a number of rides broke down throughout the day...which started to get a bit frustrating.",Disneyland_Paris

195236008,4,2014-2,Ireland,"I really enjoyed the experience in terms of the magic of Disney. I LOVE thrill rides, not the place for them I'm afraid. (head for Thorpe Park I'd say) 5 of them here, 1 under repairs, 2 had technical difficulties for a bit and another wasn't that 'thrill'ish. The money they put into the sets of every type of ride really pays off. NO BAGGAGE STORAGE, but not much need to be honest. Book tickets in advance, the FNAC website usually have good deals and possibly include the Studios too to get more rides in. And I would highly recommend getting a return Metro ticket to Paris en route to Disneyland because the queue after 8pm is about 40mins!! A good place for younger families. Defo fastpass wherever you can as it's free and saves on queuing for 45mins. Parade runs at 5pm, not great to watch but it's brilliant to get on the rides as everyone's out watching it. The light show at 8pm is TOTALLY worth waiting for (apart from Daddies with kids on their shoulders standing in the way)",Disneyland_Paris

We chose to only go to the Disneyland Park as we knew we would be pushed for time anyway. Wow. What a day. Make sure you get a good sleep the night before cause there is lots to do! The food is not as expensive as everyone makes out considering it is a tourist attraction and well known all over the world. We went to 'The Lucky Nugget' for lunch in Frontierland and it was   30 for 2 unlimited drinks a main meal (burger, BBQ ribs etc with chips) and a dessert. Not bad in our books. Fast track is great but can only do one ride at a time. Space mountain is the best ride in the park but not for young children.

195132578,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"I wasnt going to write a review but after reading some of the terrible ones here i had to stick up for Disneyland : )We have just returned from a 5 day break, 17th   21st feb and it was our second visit. We stayed at the Santa Fe this time and we are 2 adults and 2 children (aged 5 and 7).We had a fantastic time and cannot fault anything!!I booked direct during the 30 days of yes and we drove via le shuttle with an over night stay in Canterbury on the way there to break up the journey and allow us to catch a nice early train without having to get up too early.Breakfast, this complaint bugs me! Its continental, you are not going to get sausages and bacon, if you want that then go self catering. Yes its ham, cheese and rolls but theres also toast, fruit, yogurt, croissant , pain au chocolat, nutella, jam, honey and plenty of coffee, tea, orange juice...what more do you want inc in the price? Yes the que for the toast machine gets long   simple...have something else... a few days without toast isnt going to kill anyone and the ham rolls are very good : ) Yes, it gets busy   there are alot of hungry people staying there BUT people are always leaving and freeing up tables and food is always restocked so calm down. we ate at 8.30 on our first day then changed to a later time as the little ones needed the extra sleep and we didnt feel we needed the extra hours in the park with 5 days there.Food, personally i dont think its that expensive. look before you go, plan based on your budget and take sandwich bags. Its true that yes most people make rolls at breakfast and take them into the park and we did this too incase the kids got peckish before we wanted to eat...we ended up snacking on them in the evening though as breakfast was so filling they werent needed. Menus can be found online at sites like dlrpmagic. Last year we used the meal plan and i wouldnt do this again, we found just buying what we wanted when we wanted worked much better. we ate at Planet hollywood, King ludwigs, mcdonalds, Hippo (in val d europe) and pizza planet. The food isnt out of this world, its fast its a theme park! If you want to eat on a budget go for counter service or McDs personally we love planet hollywood and pizza plant, although basic, is a must will young children   ours loved it. McD is the same price as home but a happy meal comes with fruit or yogurt and whilst we were there there was also a free dvd promo on. Ques, we went in feb half term. its also a french holiday and ques were not bad at all. the longest was 30 mins for thunder mountain but we could have used a fast pass on that. You get access to fast pass with your hotel so use it. Again though, this is a theme park and like Alton towers there will be ques...if you need to then use the extra hours, plan your routes etc or better still just enjoy your break   its a magical place. The biggest que we saw was to see the princesses and this was 75 mins so that one would be worth doing nice and early if possible. Space mountain regularly has a que less than 5 mins long so if its more go back later.Characters were everywhere!! Last year it was a bit difficult to see them with the crowds but this time round they have a nice que and a member of staff letting you know when the que is closed. the best place is around by the disney junior show in the studios park and at the top of main street in the main park   we saw LOADS!The disney junior show in english fills fast, its currently at 1pm and doors open 25 mins before   get there for then as theres a preshow thing with sofia and jake which the kids loved.The park is not run down, whilst we were there there were staff going around cleaning the chewing gum off the floor and i didnt see any cigarette ends. Look around you, the attention to detail is amazing! Go into the castle and make sure you go in the basement to see the dragon too : )The staff are lovely, they are friendly and helpful but at the least try and say please, thankyou and hello in THEIR language   its just good manners. The only rude people we encountered were sadly British.One train stop away or a few mins drive is Val d Europe, a nice big shopping centre with supermarkets and restaurants too   this is worth a visit to restock drinks etc for the room.Kettles, i can honestly say we have never stayed in a French hotel with tea making facilities...this isnt something only Disney do. We take coffee with us and a mug and borrow a kettle from the information desk   this year it was free with no deposit but last year at the cheyenne we left a deposit for this so just check   they also have tea baskets with tea bags etc you can buy.the sante fe is also very close to the esso garage where wine is from 4 euro a bottle so worth popping there if youd like a drink in the room.Shops, i also didnt find these too expensive   it depends what you are buying! minnie mouse bag with removable minnie mouse toy for 22 euros seems fab to me, a mug for 6 euros and there are plenty of little things for 5   10 euro if you want to just get the kids something small. ours loved this little tins of sweets for 1 euro (they are little but its something and then treat them to a big gift on your final day) Every shop has its own offer on a red sign by the till...buy  this  for half price if you spend 20 30 euros...its worth checking these out, we got the doll our little one wanted by getting the few bits hubby wanted from the shop with the doll on offer.drinks, these can be costly! The best tip we got? KING LUDWIGS HAPPY HOUR!! 5 7.30pm 50% off beer, soda and wine....we recommend the litre glass of beer with a shot of grenadine in it : ) its located by planet hollywood.if you eat at King ludwigs you get 20% off at the rainforest cafe and visa versa   if you wont use it give it to someone else thats heading that way (they need your receipt from the other restaurant too) might as well save someone some money.we paid   432 for hotel and park tickets inc breakfast and took 480 euros with us, this was for food, drinks and gifts...we only put 3 tshirts on our card in planet hollywood   everything else was paid for with the cash we took and that inc treats for the kids and a few beers too. It doesnt have to be expensive.If driving keep 21.70 for the toll ... they do take cards too though   its worth it to drive on those roads...no traffic, no issues just a pleasant drive.The biggest tip i can give is to embrace it. See the magic, be a kid and take things on the shoulder.....if someone pushes so what? if theres a line dont moan about it. you are making magical memories...the kids wont remember the man that pushed in   they remember mickey mouse rubbing noses with them on the parade! Have a fab time!! ooo and say hello to the man thats painted as a white statue outside the park, he`s been there for years and he`s a nice guy. Pop a euro in his tin for a kiss on the hand a picture and a chat : )",Disneyland_Paris
195118744,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,It was a great experience but take advantage of rides that offer Fast Passes   you have to go to an area near the start of the queue or near the queing area to obtain a Fast Pass. This will print out a ticket that will allow you to come back at a later time and go into a separate que which has priority over the normal queue. This helps greatly if the normal queue is massive.,Disneyland_Paris
195104162,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"What can I say that hasn't already been said in other reviews? Yes food is pricey where ever you go, shops very expensive, some queues were over an hour like crushs coaster but we queued just the once for this. On the plus side, the kids and the husband love it there, lots to do even though we repeated lots of the rides on the last day, make use of the fastpass option and the extra magic hours to squeeze a few extra rides in. French kids are a pain in the backside and the parents don't do anything to keep them under control. Pushing, shouting, and generally getting on your nerves just about sums them up. The park staff we found friendly especially if you make an effort and say bonjour and be polite. Not too busy midweek in feb half term but I know due to past experience weekends and french holidays that all changes and it becomes unbearable. Book early for the best deals. We got 2 nights free with park tickets for 5 days and worked out good value. Enjoy.",Disneyland_Paris
195074946,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"Loved   range of rides and entertainment.   Queues short  5pm parade was fabulous   8pm fireworks   gorgeous  Disliked   food was terrible, expensive and limited in range.  Take your own if you can.",Disneyland_Paris

194985608,4,2014-2,United States,"Had two days on the parks In Feb half term. The 2 extra magic hours are worth getting up early for. On Monday the queues for most rides was okay, so didn't bother with fast pass. On the Tuesday it was extremely busy with large queues on most rides, and up to 60 75mins wait on some rides in both parks and the fast track queues where also long. Also long queues to see the characters.The parades in both parks are good and the light show at the end of the evening was amazing. Everything is expensive but I was prepared for that. Its easier to eat tea before the lights show as afterwards its very busy. Its worth buying a guide book to get the best out of Disney (I used the Brits guide).My children loved it at Disney and want to go back.",Disneyland_Paris
194971827,4,2014-2,India,"We went to DLP for a long weekend, arriving friday night and leaving at 3pm monday. This was plenty of time for us but with a pregnant mum and 3 year old toddler we were limited as to what we could ride. I got an easy access pass due to being pregnant, that included my husband and toddler. This was invaluable as it allowed me to reduce my waiting time. If a queue was less than 20 mins we would usually queue but being allowed to go pretty much straight on if it was longer queues was amazing as even with this pass I was absolutely shattered from the sheer amount of walking (I work out 4 times a week, but at 7 months pregnant my feet protested quite quickly!). The parade was amazing, my daughter loved it, rides entertained her. Can't say much about the bigger adult rides as i wasn't allowed on them. If you are staying in one of the Disney hotels I would take advantage of the extra magic hours to get on some of the smaller rides, or to queue for the bigger ones. It wasn't as magical or amazing as i was expecting to be honest, but we really enjoyed it and the experience for my 3 year old daughter was completely worth it. If you can avoid buying ANY souvenirs from ANY of the shops as they are about 2 3's of the price if bought from home via the Disney store online.",Disneyland_Paris
194968553,3,2014-2,United Kingdom,"We have managed to avoid the Disney park thing for many years but succumbed to pressure from our teenagers as claiming to be  the only people they know who haven't been . The parks are well organised, we went in winter so queues were smallish. The cost of merchandise in the hundreds of shops and booths and restaurants is astronomical, almost an insult to the intellect, and was clearly a source of great stress to the parents of the wailing kids engaged in acquisitive rampages through the aisles. Horrible experience. The rides are ok if you like feeling sick, we don't. The movie part was marginally interesting. The only impressive feature is the light and fireworks show in the evening   amaaazing and not to be missed. We did stand around in the freezing cold for 90 minutes beforehand because there is inadequate seating and there were crowds of people all wanting the best view gathering well in advance of the show. Food? Yuck, have very low expectations and lots of money.",Disneyland_Paris
194956408,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"We took a group of 40 school pupils here and they loved it. On this side, there are not lots of big rollercoasters but there is still space mountain and another one involving wagons that I cant remember the name of. Indiana Jones is also there which apparently is great but doesnt open until May.There is lots here for a range of ages as for the little ones there is buzz light year which involves shooting aliens with a laser. Some of the small rides where you sit on a boat or cart and go through show the level of detail that Disney go to. 'Its a small world' and Pirates of the Caribbean' and 'haunted house' obviously have had a lot of time and effort spent on them to make them look visually interesting. It is worth asking for the parade times as you dont see many characters around the park but they are all there for the parade. When you do find a character they are very keen for you to take pictures so this is a great photo opportunity. Basics like drinks are expensive here so take plenty of cash. I would also recommend coming out of the park as there are restaurants on the outskirts of the park by the hotels just a 10 minute walk away. These are still dear but much less pricy than purchasing food within the park itself. After going on the rides there are opportunities to buy pictures, these are expensive but most dont check if you take a picture of the picture displayed on screen.It was raining all day and queues were very good and luckily most were inside so everyone kept dry. The only downside to this is that it is very dark so it is not like places like Alton towers where you get multi sensory thrills and big roller coasters but it is still worthwhile going if in the area, especially with little ones. The bigger school kids reported Alton Towers was better but then this was just because there is a limit in the size of roller coasters etc due to who their target audience is. A once in a lifetime experience so if in the area, do it. You wont be disappointed.",Disneyland_Paris
194943115,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"The Disneyland model has existed in parks in California, Florida, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Paris for nearly 60 years, and the Disney company have perfected the amusement park. I cannot fault the park in any way. The atmosphere, the props, the cast members, the attractions, the rides, the restaurants   everything. February is a risky time to visit due to potential bad weather but the queues were very short. However the park management needs to provide more cover in case of rain. The only real criticism I have are the extra magic hours. These are early opening times for annual passport holders and Disney hotel guests and allow an extra two hours in the park. The problem is that very little opens early in these two hours, including some of the popular rides. While everyone's tastes and needs will vary, highlights for everyone are the firework display, parade and railroad. I'd also recommend taking time to take in the architecture and design of the lands and park in general   there's lots of detail packed in that adds an extra dimension to the park.",Disneyland_Paris
194901513,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Really enjoyed my visit here, will return again, you cant go far wrong with a visit to any Disney park, wonderful place, adults and children can incredibly enjoy it, perfect for all the family!! you always feel welcomed!! we stayed in Disney so the shuttle service was incredibly convenient! Take a trip you will enjoy!!",Disneyland_Paris
194888171,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"We visited the park for 5 days and 4 nights staying at the Sequena Lodge in the park. I have twin boys who are 6. We booked the trip separately to flights and saved money as we were quoted nearly double for flights when I enquired with the travel company. Definitely book the transfer before you go as if you try and get a bus to the park from the airport it was nearly 80 Euros return. The hotel was brilliant with its theme of a ranger lodge. Really simple but effective. The only let down (and I have to say with everywhere we ate) was the food. Breakfast was white bread and cheese and ham and after 4 days of the same you were pretty sick of it. It was also a rush and very busy at breakfast but it did its job and you wanted to be out in the park anyway. The hotel was clean and well organised and I found the staff really helpful and pleasant.FOODIn the park the food was much the same, boring and expensive. We got the train for one stop ( from the Disney village) to the supermarket to buy water and snacks and wine for your room. This saved us loads as a soft drink (Small bottle of water) was around 5 Euros a time in the park and a small glass of wine   7 in the hotels. McDonalds was OK for price but not want you want to eat everyday. We ate in the hotel restaurant one night which cost us  120 and was disappointing. Planet Hollywood was better. Mickeys Caf   was good for the entertainment but again the food was poor. It didn't spoil our holiday as we weren't there for the food but thought Disney would done this better. PARK   Amazing. Loved Loved Loved it. The fast pass was a good idea to save on the ques. The longest we queued was about 40 mins but I can imagine in the summer it would be a lot worse. The railings for the queues showed how busy it must get. The time of the queues is displayed before you choose to go on the ride which helps. The park is spotless and so well organised. You didn't need your map after the first day as it is easy to get around. The must sees are the parade at 8pm. Don't get too close as you miss the special effects. Also the parade at 5pm in the main street. Really fab and interactive for the children. The rides are also quieter at these times because everyone is at the parade. The studios parade is also good but not as interactive and is on about 2pm. The rides vary for ages. My boys loved the runaway train and the buzz ride as well as the parachute ride in toy story land. After 3 full days in the park and 4 evenings I had had enough, not of the park but my feet and legs were killing me. The amount of walking you do and the standing around is a killer. Make sure you take your comfy shoes. Warmth and comfort is key for the most enjoyment. Our hotel had a pool and a Jacuzzi which was bliss after a long day. It is a great experience. Wouldn't do it often but will prob go back in a couple of years when the boys can go on other rides. I would say older children ( 10 onwards) may find the park rides boring as the excitement of the characters is what made it for us. The rides were just an added bonus.",Disneyland_Paris
194880365,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"I recommend a visit to Disney land if it is something your children are begging for as as an adult I found it a bit of an anti climax. You must be prepared to queue and queue. The castle is fantastic as is the firework display again you have to get a good spot early . I found a few adults very rude pushing in front of little ones and I would definatly not recommend taking very small children here as it is hectic. The food is average on the parks and very expensive, the nice resteraunts you had to pre book for.The rides were excellant but do not queue for the haunted mansion as it is not worth the wait. Overall the children enjoyed it and we got a very good deal. A word of advice watch the parades on the first day get the timings right and you can get on plenty of rides if you miss watching the parade on the second.",Disneyland_Paris
194868491,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Without hesitation I can say Disneyland Paris is my most favourite place in the whole world!! We have been here five times over the last ten years. We have stayed in the cheapest accommodation and the most expensive. Of course the Disneyland Paris hotel is unsurpassed in convenience and experience for a family visiting the park, but all holidays here have been amazing. We have been in ice, snow, sun and heatwave and have found each time to be an incredible holiday. We love it here, everything is just perfection and we have never had a bad day. OK, so the food is expensive and on busy days there are rather long queues, but what else would you expect from a Disney venue?! Knowing what to expect in advance is key, plan and it's not so bad   filling up a lunch bag at the breakfast buffet saves       !!! We would keep going back except for the fact that our children are now considered adults so it is incredibly expensive! Still, will save up for just one more trip!",Disneyland_Paris

We have three children aged between 5 and 10 and were a little bit worried about whether the mix of rides would suit all three children.

194829686,3,2014-2,United Kingdom,Just got back from disneyland paris and wasnt that impressed with the parks the park themselves are trying to recreate the style there american counterpart's have to offer but thats where it ends the fact thag people can smoke anywhere in the parks instead of having specific areas its like walking around in a giant ashtray with cigarette ends everywhere and discarded rubbish most of the fast pass machines where out of order and didnt see many characters around the park except for meet mickey in fantasyland the plus side for the park is the show at the end this is done very well. The hollywood studios park was very enjoyable especially cinemacique the tower of terror I would put on a par with orlando and the cars camera action show is a good watch. I also didnt feel comfortable walking around at night with my daughter why do they need armed soldiers walking around the carparks and train station also thd sellers selling there cheap 1 euro tat spread out on blankets outside the park exit. Come on europe look at your american counterpart's and grab a few ideas afterall is disnry is meant to be a magical experience I for 1 will stick with orlando.,Disneyland_Paris
194825542,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"We took our slightly older kids (13,11 & 9) to Disneyland Paris as a half term surprise   it was one of those things we felt we should do to add to the Memory Bank. Eurostar was brilliant and it was great to be able to get rid of our bags and go straight to the park on arrival. We had pre booked our food vouchers as we didn't want to worry about all of that. We were disappointed with how limited our choice of restaurant was on the Standard tariff   three options for supper and when we were there two of these were closed altogether, leaving the third fully booked. They did solve our problem however, when we complained. The park itself is very beautiful   you really do feel like you've landed in a Disney film. Everything is spotlessly clean and the staff all very efficient. The fast pass system works well. If you are going to go my advice would be to research research research before you go. Get the Unofficial Disney Guide and read it from cover to cover. There were a lot of things I knew about from that book which I wasn't told about through my booking process and it meant that we really got round everything in the time   I knew all the tricks and tips and had our days planned out totally. We had a great time and got round everything   I'm not sure we would have done if we'd arrived unprepared. The hotel was pretty average   we stayed at Sequoia Lodge. It's supposed to be a 3 star   it isn't   2 at the most   no coffee tea in the rooms which we really missed. Breakfast was a bun fight. They have a booking system but it doesn't help   thankfully I'd read the guide book which told me to go for breakfast early   I'm so glad I did   the queues were 25 minutes long after 8.45am!! There is no hot breakfast at all other than toast which you make yourself (2Star!) and because of the queues outside you really feel that you have to gulp and go. They have massively oversubscribed the restaurants with the number of rooms. Food in the park restaurants is edible   the all you can eat buffets are the best value   and the coffee is filthy everywhere. Go to Starbucks in the village   it really is the only place which serves decent coffee. All the food is massively expensive   3.99 Euros for a doughnut! As a slightly sceptical adult I found it pretty galling to be so blatantly ripped off. Overall though we had a lot of fun and the children loved it. Walt Disney Studios is really good fun and on reflection our best day. On arrival home you put the frustrations behind you and remember the good bits   I won't be going back though!",Disneyland_Paris

There were no cafes open at all. The only place to eat was the Studio Catering Company hall which consisted of ridiculously over priced burgers with chips and barely aynthing else. They didn't even have decent coffee. I was in France, I should be able to have a good cup of coffee! And where were the baguettes, the pastries, the crepes? And I know that I'm not in Paris, I'm in Disneyland, but why Disneyland isn't utilising the amazing food culture that is around them is beyond me. Rather there is the worst of both worlds, bad American food that is overpriced instead of providing, alongside the Armerican food, afforable quality French cuisine. Very disappointing.",Disneyland_Paris

They can't know because surely they would do something....... wouldn't they?We've had a lovely few days but there's little magic thrown around by the staff   they are pretty joyless and don't seem to delight in anything much. Don't you take a job at Disney to bring a little joy and happiness to everyone?DLP is tired, it looks old & weary with many things breaking down repeatedly.The Stunt Show at The Studios was fantastic & a highlight.The Phantom Manor at The Park was a long wait & was rubbish.We tried and failed to find anything nice to eat   accepting even the lower priced options are vastly overpriced. Toad Hall fish and chips were average but the best of the bunch. Pizza Planet was shockingly awful; as was the main food hall in the studios. Recommendation is to do anything & everything possible to avoid eating at the parks.Most important thing was our son enjoyed himself, but highly unlikely we would do this again.",Disneyland_Paris

Next time I go I will try and go for a couple of days, not just one, so that I can go on and and experience everything. It was such a wonderful day that none of us wanted to leave!",Disneyland_Paris
194712001,3,2014-2,United Kingdom,Disney magic is in the air. Well maybe only for the little ones. If you are an adult then be prepared to get bored very quickly. Some of the rides are must do rides in the park (Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain). However that is it. Indiana Jones is closed at the moment so not really somewhere I would recommend for the Thrill Seeker.Queue times get very long (even in the quieter seasons). And when you are queing you are herded through a makes of barriers and all you can see is people. Other parks try and keep the line length a mystery. Not Disney. You can see exactly how many people are in front of you and there is very little to do but wait. Having spent a lot of time in the shops you find all the stuff the same. There is no thought gone into separating the merchandise to make you search for products. Go into any shop in the park and you can find exactly the same stuff as the last; even in the themed shops. A little more thought into the whole park and I may just revisit. But not in a hurry at the moment.,Disneyland_Paris
194709920,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"I have always loved Disneyland Paris, particularly in December. It's definitely the best time to go, as the weather is so crisp and sunny. The park looks gorgeous! And of course, the Christmas festivities, including all of the decorations, the Christmas tree turn on every night and the finale, are out of this world! I had a brilliant time. The park was moderately quiet, so queues were short. With the addition of Disney studios, I would definitely recommend going to the park for a minimum of 4 days (3 nights). There is so much to do and see! The only down side was the lack of variation in food. Be prepared to eat lots of fast food  burgers and chips! If you can, bring in food from outside. They don't check your bags for this or take it from you, so if you can, definitely do it!",Disneyland_Paris
194630950,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"Having been lucky enough to visit Disneyworld and Disneyland Paris a few times, this is my first review. Went with partner and toddler. Stayed at Sequoia Lodge (have previously stayed at davy crockett, but first time in a proper Disney Hotel), room nice, freshly painted and roomy enough. Breakfast fine (although absolutely packed today due to half term, not so busy and a much more pleasant experience previous days), good bits: watching our son's face when he saw met character, he and we loved the rides. Totally worth getting up early for whole extra magic hours, walked onto main rides and went on each a few times before main park opening, then free to walk around and go on some of the less popular rides while missing queues later in the day. Well planned fast passes make a big difference. Disney parade and dreams absolutely brilliant. Bad bits: toilets in certain areas quite rotten   I know the habits of other guests are not really Disney's faults, but they should keep on top of this. Luckily I found some toilets tucked away that were quiet and clean! Food: not a lot of choice, you can do healthy eating if you pick the right places, but few and far between (agrabah cafe made a nice change and the steakhouse in the village was great, blue lagoon nice too), characters too few and far between, has hoped to see more having stayed in disney hotel but only saw goofy on first morning (we were there five nights) which was a shame. We coughed up for breakfast at cafe mickey which was worth seeing my son's face, but I felt cheated at having to pay even more for this (although obviously my choice), only a few meet n greets in main park and same characters each time, only change was Captain Hook, smee and Wendy in pirates area one day which was a shambles   we waited twenty minutes patiently ( as did others with young children) only for adults and older teenagers to be push through and be picked ( while cast members watched) and then to be told they were leaving, did put a bit of a spoiler on the day, having said that other meet n greets were well organised. If we can get a good deal, we will return, otherwise will save for Florida which I think has that bit extra.",Disneyland_Paris
194616781,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"Here are a few tips that we put together for the park and have amended for this visit having now been three times.   We have been twice before in May and February and were surprised that the park was so much busier in February than May and it wasn   t a French holiday. Weekdays were quiet and certainly worth blitzing the rides that have long queues.   Tip for some rides     if your children are young and happy to dress up then the whole family can use Thunder Mountain via the Fastpass line as many times as they want if they are dressed as cowboys (or Jess from Toy Story). The same applies if you dress as Buzz for the Buzz Lightyear ride. Both of these had big queues during the day.    The    Baby Switch    system works well. You don   t have to have a baby but a child that doesn   t want to go on a ride. As you go through the gates ask the attendant for a baby switch voucher and they give you a piece of paper that allows your partner to then jump to the front of the queue with up to 2 children (depending on the ride e.g. Thunder Mountain allows 3 in a row so you can take three children but Crushers Coaster will only allow 1 with you). This is done well and you don   t feel awkward. There is no time limit on these so every ride we got one of these and then used them during the day if there were any queues or if the fast pass system didn   t apply to a ride. I think it would even be possible to do without a child but I   m not advocating this!!!    We have found that as time has gone on they have become a little more attentive to this system to ensure that it works fairly.These were the top tips that my wife wrote down for us to take into the park:   FASTPASS RIDES     on busy days these run out quickly and they close the fast pass machines down around lunchtime. They also don   t open them at all on some rides e.g. Indiana Jones     we asked them about this and they said that it depends on the foot count through the front door. If it   s busy at all then they don   t run it at all on this ride!   Indiana Jones, Temple of Peril  Adventureland height 1.4m   Space Mountain Mission 2  Discoveryland 1.32m   Buzz lightyear Laser blast  Discoveryland    Star tours  Discoveryland 1.02m   Big thunder mountain  Frontierland 1.02m   Peter Pans flight  Fantasyland   Rock and Roll Coaster  Studios Backlot 1.2m   The twilight zone Tower terror  Studios Production Courtyard 1.02m   Flying carpets over Agrobah  Studios Toon studio   Popular rides with no fast pass:   Crush Coaster Studios 1.07m     the only way to do this ride is to get in first thing in the morning. The Studios doors open at 9:30am     head straight to this ride and it will be the shortest queue of the whole day. We never saw the wait time on this ride to be less than 60 minutes.   RC Racer Studios 1.2m   Autopia Discovery land 1.32 self drive   It   s a small world  Fantasy land (long queue but moves quickly)   Pirates of caribean  Adventure land (long queue but moves quickly, beware younger children  get wet and drop)   Other helpful hints   Always very long queue to see The Princesses near it   s a Small World go early. The wait time is frequently 2 hours.   Captain EO   waste of time   Fastpass after 2 hours from previous one issued   or after the earliest time that your current Fastpass is valid from.   Magic hours 8 10am:   Space Mountain Discovery land   Buzz lightyear Discovery land   Peter Pan Fantasy land   Dumbo Fantasy land   Madhatter tea cups Fantasy land   Le Carrousel Fantasy land   Character Hunting     my kids loved getting autographs and photos. When it is busy you need to plan this well and find out on the information sheets where they are going to be. A fantastic place to get some unusual characters at the weekend is out side the Lilo and Stitch show at 11:00 am and 12:00pm outside the main studio block. Here we found Lilo, Stitch, Ratatouille characters, Buzz characters, Cruella de Ville, princesses etc etc. This year they have improved this process with ordered queues and staff indicating the end of the queue so that you don   t wait and then the character walks off. The next best place is at the end of the procession that happens several times a day. The train stops outside the castle and then all of the characters go to fixed place each day. We worked out where Donald and Daisey went and got photos with both of them within a few minutes.The next bit is only for the sad ones who want to get a good score on Buzz Lightyear! The targets score different points (Circle   100, Square   500, Diamond   5,000, Triangle   10,000). There are some added, hidden targets as well. On Zurg on his upper chest in the midline is a target that gets you 50,000 points. There are also some targets in the dark tunnel on the roof that score very highly. There are others including the mystery Mickey Mouse target but I won   t spoil it for all! So stick to diamonds and triangles and look for the hidden targets. Make the most with a breakdown and reboot of the system as you can score vast amounts!",Disneyland_Paris

194546656,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"Although things considered the break was good, we stayed in the Seaquoia lodge, and found it to be clean tidy, and the staff very helpful, we did encounter a rather busy breakfast area which was a bit of a  free for all , especially when they ran out of plates and bowls only for everyone to push in when they arrived, but am sure this is an isolated incident,The park was as always excellent for all the family, but did experience various problems with the rides, the train around the disney land park broke down, the studios tour also broke down in disney studios, as did the Aerosmith roller coaster which resulted in me and the rest of the carriage being escorted via the staff car park back into the park, Please be aware that the park and restaurants are well over priced(7 euros for a beer 18 euros for a burger in some places), so the meal package is definitely worth doing, ps use the table service restaurants, Annettes and Silver Spur were both very good, as the buffets are again a free for all,Having said all the above, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, my little boy cried when we had to leave,",Disneyland_Paris
194516379,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"We found the park still as good as when we went 4 years ago, the new parade was good and the show Dreams was really good. Glad we went back and we will certainly be going again.Just be prepared that the food in there is expensive and there is no real alternative to this so it can get pricey.",Disneyland_Paris
194491573,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,We went to Disneyland Paris this february for a short break. The park was good but not all the rides were open but we were aware of this when we booked this still did not stop us enjoying ourselves. The food in the parks is extremely expensive so I would suggest calling at the train station before going in and purchasing food there. Even though it was still winter season all the attractions were open Saturday and Sunday and most disney characters were around the park then but during the week we never saw them. My last suggestion is that if you go in February like we did make sure that you take very warm clothes.,Disneyland_Paris
194410831,3,2013-10,United Kingdom,"I have been to Disney land Paris many times, particularly since I lived in Paris for over 5 years. It is clearly one of the top five attractions on offer. The new Disney park certainly had growing pains, e.g. long, disorganised, and jumping queues. Attraction breakdowns and very limited choices of expensive food. Shopping was in fact pleasurable as the different lands sold themed merchandise even different to Disney Shops in the high street. Over a period of time the gardens became established looking more and more attractive each visit but the grounds were not kept to the same standard as the American Disney theme parks. It was noted that there were fewer random sightings of Disney Characters each visit but despite a few moans and groans the overall experience was still pleasant albeit expensive and still the long queues.After a 7 year break A couple of work collegues and I decided to brace the park once again in October 2013. It's probably not the best time to go as it is very cold and the parks shut early . So this is what we found: Positives include: Attractive gardens and good Halloween decorations.No waiting in either theme park for shows or rides. Although some attractions were closed or under going renovation. Aerosmith and Space Mountain Roller coasters are surprisingly white knuckle experiences. Not suitable for all riders despite the latest technology. Space Mountain did break down so no time for another go. Thunder Mountain, was as good as ever because the thrill comes at the end of the ride which is not possible in the States due to a fault line running under the earth. There was no change to the Indiana Jones ride which is way too jerky and harsh on the neck but my friends liked it anyway.Negatives include: Boring shopping experience. Choices not as good as previous years despite many new characters. Merchandise very expensive and not of good quality particularly food items. Restaurants full. Long waiting times and the food was poor for french standards. Missing seeing Disney Characters   very limited times and places.  The Santa Fe hotel was cold day and night. There was a general lack of facilities, towels soap etc. Breakfast was a shambles. Not much choice as the food rapidly disappeared   not to be replaced. In conclusion. The park looked tired and empty. The Shops were a waste of time. We were grateful that we only had to buy one meal because we waited over 2 hrs for a hamburger and chips. The best experiences were the Disney Parade, The firework show and a couple of rides. So we were not really impressed. Only there for 2 nights but decided to go into Paris to see the real sights",Disneyland_Paris
194402803,2,2014-2,United Kingdom,"I must admit I hated the everyman for themselves attitude whether it was queuing for attractions, shuttle buses, breakfast it was literally a free for all people would try and squeeze through the smallest gaps to get in front of you even if you had small children the attitude absolutely stunk to high heaven, I seen grown men fighting kids screaming and this was the quite season? Never again it turned me into an aggressive queue jumper myself in the end. Otherwise me and my family will have been walked all over, and I hated what I had become too stressful and aggressive and confrontational not my idea of fun, despite the park and attractions being superb",Disneyland_Paris
194387499,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I felt like a child inside, all looks like a fairy tale. A bit too expensive though: ticket, food, drinks or memorabilia.",Disneyland_Paris
194299955,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"I absolutely love Disneyland Paris. I've been several times   both as a child with family and as an adult with partner. Every single time, the park never fails to deliver a completely magical and memorable day, with the only downside being the incredible amount of miles you walk throughout the day!Seriously though, you can't fault this place. An amazing team, atmosphere and the rides are fantastic. One of my favourite places in the world.",Disneyland_Paris
194233165,5,2014-1,United Kingdom,"If you go to the Disneyland Park, you know what you want to see, and they are very good at delivering it. Nothing is cheap, but you are not going there for a budget get away.Enter into the spirit and you will not be disappointed.",Disneyland_Paris
194169233,5,2013-11,United Kingdom,MAGICAL   it literally took my breath away walking down Main Street USA to the beautiful Sleeping Beauty Castle   I felt like a little girl again and I can not contain my excitement for going back there again in September :),Disneyland_Paris
194145850,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"Love the tingly feeling when you arrive but it's definitely showing it's age now. Many rides had elements closed in it and many rides where breaking down throughout the day. There is work being carried out on painting and improvements but it's easy to see that large amounts of money now need spending to improve the park and bring new elements and rides to it. Still fun and still amazing parade and omg disney dreams was fab but come on disney, invest money and we'll keep coming back",Disneyland_Paris
194109283,5,2013-12,United States,"The park was very quiet in December so we were able have many, many rides which made the whole experience quite reasonably priced. The park is easy to get around and is extremely clean. There is a great range of rides to suit all age groups and personalities. My kids loved the mad hatters tea cups, the Alice in Wonderland labyrinth, the Indiana Jones ride, Buzz Light Year and Space Mountain rides and many others.",Disneyland_Paris
194075502,4,2013-12,United Kingdom,"Visited during christmas. Decorated lovely   parades great and show at castle a must see. This park has lots of good rides for all ages. Younger children will love the parades and meeting Mickey Mouse. Negatives:Queues a nightmare, really rude people who push in even push young children,really dark at night and easy to get lost so familiarise yourself with park during day light. All of these do not out weigh the good points so well worth the experience.",Disneyland_Paris
194049088,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"I have wanted to go here since I was a child. I'm now in my mid 20's and I finally got to go. When walking into the park I turned into a child again! Sorry to be cliched but it was truly magical! Myself and my boyfriend chose to do two parks in one day. We started with disney park. We arrived at ten in the morning and we walked up to all the rides with no que more than 5mins. My favourite thing in this park was big thunder mountain. It was so much fun we ended up returning before that park closed and going again! We ate our packed lunch just beside big thunder.We then headed over to Walt studios. This park is smaller and not quite as good in my opinion. We got a picture with buzz and then went to the toy story land. Here the ques were longer. We waited 40 mins to go on the rc racer. But it was worth the wait. So much fun! Picture really wanted to go on crushes coaster but didn't feel like queuing for another 45 mins. We then went on the rock n roll coaster. I was quite anxious about this one. And It was warranted! For me it was horrendous! It's not that it was scary, but more the sensation was horrible. My headband flew off, my head was banging against the sides and my legs got quite bruised. I'm quite petite so that's probably why this happened! My boyfriend however loved it!! After thus, my neck and shoulders hurt, so we decided not to go on the tower of terror. We headed back over to the disney park and waited for the parade. We sat on a bench near the castle and had a perfect, front row view of the parade, which was really good! Except, it didn't last long enough for me!At closing time we went to see the disney dreams firework and light show. All I can say is wow! I was expecting a good show but I was blown away, it was extraordinary! I was in awe the whole time. After the shortness of the parade I was expecting this to be the same. But it lasted 25 minutes! Overall this was an amazing day! The park was immaculate, staff friendly,and the experience magical :)",Disneyland_Paris
194036742,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,Magical.  No other words really to describe it!  Gets busy   obviously!  Just go and make the most of your time here!,Disneyland_Paris
193968959,4,2013-4,Switzerland,"Ok. There are lines to wait in & the kids want something from every food souvenir stand you pass. Isn't it all part of the experience? I've had some pretty nice conversations with my children while waiting in line and can you tell me of someone who doesn't like treats from the carts? Disney Paris is a smaller version of its U.S. cousins but this isn't really a bad thing as it makes the park more manageable for families with smaller children. I would think 4 5 days appropriate for a first trip and 2 3 days good for subsequent visits. We've been here twice. 2 adults, 2 children. (ages 0&4 first trip.. 1&5 second trip)A few notes on the Disneyland Park side:The character parade is nice the first time & ok the second. The 3rd time around papa had serious thoughts about throwing himself under one of the floats.The light fireworks show is worth seeing. Great job. Get your places early if you want a decent view. The castle: I understand that traffic for the whole park is pretty much routed through here so they can't really make this an attraction, but the castle is always a disappointment. The most spectacular building on the Disney campus is actually a ....Souvenir store.Most rides can handle kids but this will depend on your kid. My 5 year old couldn't get enough of the roller coaster but the haunted house was a bit too spooky for her.Although younger children will need to be carried, the pirate area has several caves to explore, a treehouse, a wobbly suspension bridge, and a small playground. Fun area for the 5 year old.There are audience participation dance shows scheduled every so often that seem to be fun for most kids (mine won't join in).It's a small world...Iconic ride. Every parent should be forced to do this at least once with their kids. The kids adore it but papa started thinking about jumping ship about the 4th time through (end of the night, no line,  can we go again papa ...you parents know what I mean).Food: While there are plenty of on location restaurants that offer a wide variety of menus, we usually decided to get out of the park and eat in the disney village. Characters: Oddly enough, I think I saw more characters at the other park versus this one. I do remember having a 2 hour wait to get a photo with Ariel at one point. There's an actual  house  that you an go and meet Mickey where hey have a Professional photographer taking pictures (you can take your own too if you like). Disney offers a babypass system that allows one parent to wait in line, go on the ride and then hand a pass to the second parent to ride without another full wait. This worked out well for my wife (who always waited with the baby versus being in line) and my older daughter (who got to go on all attractions twice).The train ride around the park, while not the most exciting, is a nice 10 15 minute break from standing walking.Oh. Did I mention that they have a few souvenir stands? Added up I bet we paid more for this stuff than we did for park entrance. Oh well. It's part of the magic.",Disneyland_Paris
193917530,5,2013-4,United States,So much fun! I recommend space mountain and fasten all three seat harness they have on your ride lol. I assure you that you will experience major speed unlike the USA states space mountain roller coaster hahaha! I must go back for more. I was glad to see english written signs. Great place good times!! My visit was in 2005,Disneyland_Paris
193853854,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Simply brilliant....but even on weekdays we spent hours waiting in ques for rides. I would strongly recommend fast lane pass if you can afford or want to save time. Very well maintained, found it very clean. The parade was fun and you could see the little ones were in heaven!!! Would certainly recommend a visit if you are in Paris (though it involves bit of train journey from main city). If you have fast lane pass one day is probably enough otherwise spare around one and half to two days. Have fun.",Disneyland_Paris
193769946,4,2013-3,Sweden,"Having visited Disneyland, Paris twice I must say it  s well worth the entrance fee and sometime long qeues..Overall nice and friendly staff and a smart fast lane qeue syestem for those who have the time or fast legs in their exploration of this vast park!Recommend it to all Young or old visitors!",Disneyland_Paris
193747712,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,My little man loved loved loved buzz lazer blast and the its a small world boat ride. I would go during the week when it is quiet as the que times at the weekend are horrendous waiting times of nearly 2 hrs to sit on a ride for less than 2 mins was crazy! Be careful outside the park as there was lots of people trying to scam money from the tourists one even grabbed my husband and tried to stop him walking off when he told her he wasn't giving her any money. The parade was fun and the disney dreams show was great too.,Disneyland_Paris
193642158,5,2014-2,Sweden,Visited on an rainy Satarday in hope the lines would be shorter. But most of the rides where between 30 70 minutes most of the day. So no idea to beleive bad weather stops people to come here!!,Disneyland_Paris
193526351,1,2014-1,United Kingdom,"First time at eurodisney going with my nieces. The atmosphere is awful... Feels like a factory not holidays. While some of the attractions are fun and the kids love them, it feels that everything is made and designed to take your money not to help you or make you feel good. Factor onto this the overcrowding of the park and you have an awful experience... Why would anyone wait 2 hours in the queue for 1 single minute of turtle ride is beyond me... I come out of three days there feeling like disney is the worst brand in the world and that the ethical etho consisting in ripping off your customers because their children are conditionned to like disney characters is completely unacceptable.",Disneyland_Paris
193473578,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"My boyfriend and I visited Disneyland Paris on 5th & 6th Feb.Travel:I would highly recommend using the eurostar as opposed to driving, it's cheaper and you can just chill out. Being adults we did find there were a lot of screaming children   but we're going to a kids theme park so we couldn't complain! The train station is slap bang next door to the park which is a bonus. We'd heard of this thing in the station called Disney Express whereby you drop your bags off and they get taken to the hotel for you   Don't bother. for 11 euros each it's a complete con. We were happy to take the bags to our hotel as you can drop them off there even if you can't check in yet! The shuttle buses are fantastic, the hotels are literally a 5 minute walk from the park but if the weather is rubbish and you've got heavy bags this is your best bet, they run every 12 15 minutes, I don't know why there are complaints about them, it's free!!Hotel:We stayed in the Seqouia lodge room 2063. We arrives at 2.45pm and upon booking were told we could check in at 3pm. The queue was ridiculous and there were only 2 or 3 members of staff checking you in! tip: have your passport handy as they do need to check them upon arrival! We were smoothly and quickly checked in and told we could go straight to our room. After the longest walk EVER (I'm not joking when I say it took just under 10 minutes to walk to our room, it's such a big hotel) we finally found ours   Housekeeping were in there still making up our room but this wasn't a problem as they left straight away and luckily they were just finishing.The room itself was very nice. I can't complain as it is a 3 star hotel, you get what you pay for. The room was clean. tip: bring your own towels   if you're used to big fluffy comfortable towels you won't be impressed with what you're given! you do get given about 4 but they are very small. The only thing I could complain about was the lack of channels on the TV but then again who goes on holiday just to watch TV? The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. All in all I was very impressed with the whole lodge.Breakfast: I have seen SO many reviews complaining about the queue for breakfast. We didn't get caught up in it at all. Breakfast for us was at 8.45am and it was nice and quiet. The choice of food is very french (obviously) croissants, pan au chocolat etc etc there are plenty of cereals so you won't go hungry!Walt Disney Studios:On our first day we ventured to the studios. The park itself is very clean and kept nice and tidy. We were actually quite surprised at how few attractions there were in this park. There are plenty of fast food outlets if you don't want to spend silly amounts of money on food! There are rides for all ages however, no matter how young or old you are. We went for the highly anticipated and recommended Crush's Coaster. Being a huge rollercoaster buff I was very much looking forward to it. After 30 minutes of queueing there was an annoucement to say the ride had broken down   no biggie, we said we'd go back later. Definitely go on the rock n roller coaster with Aerosmith. Tower of terror was fantastic too!   we went back to the Crush Coaster and it still hadn't been fixed and even after being fixed there was over an hour wait. We decided to go back to it the next day.Disneyland Main Park:We got through the studios so quick we went to the main park, again extremely clean and very well themed. We couldn't believe the amount of Disney shops there were. The whole of main street is shop upon shop! Rides: Being 20 I wasn't even ashamed of going on Its A Small World! The detail and thought into this ride is quite overwhelming. Big thunder mountain exceeded expectations! I thought it'd be a small little runaway train but it had me screaming the whole way around! The phantom manor just behind big thunder mountain was my favourite when I was younger. I couldn't believe how run down and out of date it seemed. I know it would cost so much to replace but as you get older you notice how much of an upgrade some of the rides do need! The good thing about going mid week was how short the queues were. We got straight on to everything as it was so quiet! People complain about the weather. Here's a tip: take a coat.Food:We knew straight away food was going to be expensive so we took 100 euros each. We ate at Planet Hollywood in the Disney Village. Our waiter was absolutely fantastic, I think his name was Matt   helped that he was British as we could have banter with him. He needs to be in management as he was just so friendly and the service was quick and speedy. I'd say go around 3pm after the manic lunch rush. We went back for lunch the next day at 1pm and it was absolutely slammed so we went elsewhere. But the food costs alot. It was over 4 euros for a small glass of coke! The food was lovely however, the burgers were massive!Shops: I have never seen so much Disney merch in all my life! I was just shocked at the prices. I think everyone is though, I feel sorry for families of 4 or over. We found it a bit much just being the two of us! Overall it was a brilliant trip, it didn't matter that it was cold, most of the rides are undercover anyway! tip: where it was so quiet we really only needed 2 days, I think if we were there for a week we would have got bored   we were too knackered to do anything else!",Disneyland_Paris
193470963,4,2014-2,United Kingdom,"This is my 3rd visit but 1st with children.Staff were all friendly , we had a disabled pass because of my health which made a huge difference in queuing times.my 4yr old met 4 princesses she was overwhelmed ! The castle light show was amazing an the parade was so lovely ! Repunzal and Cinderella pointed out my daughters dress (while in parade) an made her day !! The park was so clean . We had half board and ate in 4 different restaurants all good ! If only it had been warmer on our visit that was my only fault !!",Disneyland_Paris
193411679,5,2014-2,United Kingdom,"Fantasic so much to see and do. Stayed in the Sequoia lodge for 4 nights and had 5 days for both parks. It is a bit run down in places but it is old and some rides were closed as they are cleaning them up. Of course the kids don't notice these things and were more than happy with the magic of it all.Kids are 3 and 8 and we could all get on Thunder mountain which was great. I like big rollercoasters where my husband doesn't but being early Feb there wasn't much waiting time so I could get on while the kids went with there dad to have a look at all the the quieter walk throughs and big shops.If you can bring food in with you or happy to walk to the village for a Mcdonalds or Earl of sandwich you will be saving a lot of money and to be honest getting a better meal. Most food places were samey and all quite expencive which you have to expect so theres no point comparing menues or prices unless your wanting a proper meal in one of the restaurants.I've last went when I was 21 and before that I was 11, being 31 now with a family I still love it and think this may be a regular place for us. This was my first proper stay in the resort though and we were never lost for stuff to do and didn't go on the same thing twice. Once you've been round it all and one the rides you start to notice all the little details which is great. This is where dreams are made! :)",Disneyland_Paris
193365952,3,2014-2,United Kingdom,"We stayed in the Santa Fe hotel which is basic but everything you need, bed, toilet, sink etc. you spend very little time in the rooms. Hotel a little dated but nothing to worry about. There's a phone in the room for a wake up call but the automated service is in French, I was able to work out what to do and was able to use away at the service.Breakfast is hell, busy and rushed with pushy rude people with no manners or scruples, my kids were fair game to be stepped on in the quest for a croissant. It's a cold meat selection with a mix if cubes of cheese, some croissants, bread rolls and brioche. Cereal and a fruit cocktail available. Tea and coffee from a machine. Be smart and make up ham rolls to take in to the park with you, we'll come to the reason soon.......There's. Shop in the hotel which is full if the usual toys available all over the park and Disney village. Dress up suits expensive, most other stuff not badly priced given where you are.Free bus service every fifteen minutes from hotel to the park, good service but the usual crush applies here also. My kids trampled on by pushy men and women who don't seem to understand what a queue is, fight your way on because you'll end up trying to balance on the bus where the driver takes you on a white knuckle ride. It's a good service ruined by the rude users. Women and kids are not given preference for seats.The park itself.....the grounds are spotless, absolutely spotless. The rides and decor showing age a bit but grand enough. Quite a few rides were closed but probably expected because I assume it would be off season for them. Though it was disappointing.I personally found the staff brilliant, language barrier aside they were helpful and as pleasant as you can be when dealing with the 100th needy tourist whilst standing in the rain and wind. Disney studios was pretty similar, helpful staff but a few bits and pieces closed.The food inside the parks is not great, you won't starve but if you had a choice..........bring ham rolls you prepared earlier in the breakfast hall. One place sold 3 drinks with one croissant in a breakfast deal, can't understand it, a carton of milk, orange juice and a coffee. Doesn't make sense really. A lot of the hot food stands were closed which further limited your choice. The food is not cheap, even in the hot food stand, expect to pay nearly    10 for a coffee and a bun. The prices for everything is the same everywhere, all owned by Disney so no need for competitive pricing!Buffet food was horrendous. Absolutely horrendous value.    25 to    30 for all you can eat depending on whether you get drinks and adult or child. Food was passable but no better and nowhere near worth the money. Very over priced given the quality available when you can go to a restaurant and order something you actually want for less. I would avoid the buffet restaurants in the park and go outside to the Disney village for dinner. For lunch either take your own (which you aren't allowed to do by the rules so be sneaky btw) or else go to one of the fast food restaurants in the park that do pre prepared meals. Again it's over priced but a damn sight better than the buffet places.The hotel bar in the Santa Fe was ok. Again the staff were brilliant but the pricing is bit much. Don't bother ordering a snack from the bar, way way way too pricey,    6 to    8 for a small board of approximately 6 slices of chorizo, and I mean 3 slices cut in two......the beer is ok but pricey and never had a head or seemed fizzy enough. Just passable but not quite right for the price when you want a relaxing beer after walking miles and miles round the park. Don't bother with Guinness by the way, as a native of Northern Ireland the Guinness abroad is never the way it should be....it's an art form to pour and it just isn't given it's deserved place abroad.I would recommend the following places....Annette's diner though it doesn't do bookings. Most restaurants do bookings and it is advisable to do so because most crowds swarm places. However Annette's is pretty good.Cafe Mickey is ok but not as good as a few years ago.Buffalo Bill's Wild West show is expensive but very good fun and half decent food though no choice so be aware. Well worth a visit.The Disney light show is absolutely fantastic, brilliant show but again be prepared for a pushing and shoving match for a good view!Overall the park was ok. Had it not been Disney it would be a definite miss but the park or surviving on the good staff and the desire of kids to see the characters. I would go back but not anytime soon, it's far too expensive for what you get in terms of food. Leave it another couple of years.",Disneyland_Paris
193364117,4,2014-1,United States,"Disneyland Paris is very small compared to Disney World or Disneyland CA but a lot of fun. We visited in Jan. and it was cold but there were no lines for the rides and we did it all in a few hours. We speak no French but had no problems, most shows are in English. The cast members are very nice.",Disneyland_Paris
193333433,4,2014-2,United States,"Visited 2 5 Feb. Plus point 1. five minutes from the train station 'get off walk in'OK we did have the luxury of staying at the Disneyland Hotel so location for us was ideal. Firstly I will agree with the reviewer below the rides do need a coat of paint (look at the horses on the carousel but I'm an adult and the kids wouldn't notice really).I never encountered one CM who wasn't smiling and to be honest I wouldn't want to do their job standing around in the cold all day and trying to remain cheerful while checking the kids safety. The only NON smiler was the lady at the till in Plaza Gardens Restaurant OMG could curdle milk. This park is the better option for the younger kids as it has more rides for them. The only thing that really struck me was 'baby changing facilities' why is there no paper roll to put on the baby changing counters? they are metal and freezing to put a baby on, I had to use hand towels. We were there out of season and the majority of the rides were a straight walk on or approx 5 10 minutes (plus we had early entry so managed to get on everything early without the need for any fast passes). Elder child (10) loved Thunder Mountain rode it NUMEROUS times, Space Mountain ditto, Pirates of the Caribbean. and the other two children 4 & 2 had plenty to ride on the others. I do understand that NO pushchairs are allowed on any rides but there is not a lot of cover from the cold when you have to wait with a a sleeping child. Would I visit again? probably not but have been to Florida and once the kids get a bit older will go there instead. Finally must say the Dream Show was amazing none of the fireworks were too loud or scary for little ones.",Disneyland_Paris
193319815,3,2014-2,United Kingdom,"I hadn't been to Disneyland Paris in well over 10 years and was very excited to see how it has changed   sadly apart from Finding Nemo ride I didn't notice any improvements or changes   and even more sad is many of the original rides seem very dated now and haven't been improved or enhanced in any noticeable ways (for example the Pirates of the Caribbean doesn't feature Johnny Depp and crew like in the US). My biggest qualm is the customer service, true you can't expect the French to be as enthusiastic as American Disney staff but it was so poor and many times rude that it did put a damper on the experience. And finally, the food selection was dire! I expect to be ripped off at Disney BUT unless I wanted to shell out the big bucks for a sit down restaurant the ONLY option was burgers and fries! Other Disney Parks had much more variety food wise and I only wish I had been as smart as many of the French tourists I saw which smuggled in their own food.",Disneyland_Paris
193254243,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,Disneyland is such a good place (for young & old!) My sister and i have been quite a few times and love it every time! The rides such as space mountain are always a winner with us two!,Disneyland_Paris
193190670,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"2 of my friends treated me to a 3 day trip here as I never went when I was young. I can honestly say it was the most fun I've ever had on holiday! The theme park was perfectly run, everything is paid so much attention to detail. The rides were fantastic, the whole atmosphere is just so unlike anywhere I've been before! I felt so relaxed and detached from the real world I could have easily stayed longer! I wouldn't hesitate returning especially with children. However, this is definitely not just a place for kids! Adults will love it! We didn't stay in a Disney hotel, just somewhere on the outskirts, so I can't comment on their accommodation. The only downside is the queuing times   my advice would be to take your own pack up and water and you'll be fine! We visited in July and the queues could have been loads worse   the most we had to wait was 1 hour but mostly it was lots shorter than this. Also, beware of queue jumpers   we found ourselves making human walls in queues to prevent this from happening! Overall, I would 100% recommend a trip here   there's something for everyone and it's just brilliant!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
193176655,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"We stayed in the western themed Disney hotel Cheyenne for two nights the first thing to remember is that although your paying five star prices this is in fact two star, the kids loved the western theme and the restaurant apart from being extremely busy and expensive is well run with a wide range of decent food available. The parks themselves were only a ten minute walk from the hotel or a couple of minutes on the shuttle bus, seeing the kids faces as we walked around the parks was worth the price alone with plenty of Disney characters dotted around for you to have your photo with ,there was a wide range of rides and attractions for every age and taste ,we were there for two and a half days and needed at least one more! On the Friday evening went to see the Wild West show which was one of the highlights of the trip, couldn't afford to do it every year but as a treat for us all a memorable way to spend a few days.",Disneyland_Paris
193141092,4,2014-1,United Kingdom,"We were looking for something different to do during New Year and usually we go away to some European for a New Year break. We have friends with a young family and we decided to look at Disneyland Paris. The prices were ridiculously high for the New Year period, but about three weeks after the prices more than halved. We stayed at the Davey Crocket Chalets, which is less than a 10 minute ride away and with 4 days access to the Parks the prices were very affordable. We drove to Folkstone, hopped on the Chanel Tunnel and then drove the Disney. The ride from Calais to Disney is about three hours, but is more or less one big long road. The road to incur a Toll, but for around 21 Euros it's worth it. We arrived at Disney on the Wednesday and the park was virtually ours. For three days we could hop on   off all the rides without waiting. The kids got to see all the characters and the parade was brilliant. The Saturday filled up pretty quick and from having not to wait for anything we waiting 45mins a ride. If Disney is something you would like to do and you don't mind getting wrapped up warm to enjoy it, I would certainly recommend going at this time. The waterparks are not open, which would upset some people, but everything else was there.",Disneyland_Paris
193140712,4,2013-10,United Kingdom,Lots of great Halloween decorations up and they were very well done . Wasn't too busy which was a bonus and we all had a great time . Only downside was that we wanted to see the fireworks which are on really late if you have children and have just come for the day (10pm). We were starting to get hungry and 90% of the restaurants were shut with just a couple of counter service places open serving the usual reheated burgers etc.. In the end we had to leave the park and get something to eat outside meaning we missed the fireworks! I've been 3 times now at various times of the year and I'm still yet to see them!,Disneyland_Paris
193130782,5,2013-8,Hong Kong,We became a second time the children and it is very different than in Hong Kong. It was more for adult than children. My wife and I was really happy to take picture with the Disney personages like plutot or Mickey.,Disneyland_Paris
193080901,5,2014-1,United Kingdom,"One of the most thrilling days I spent in my 5 journey trip in Paris. If you are a fan of Disney movies, stories,and rides, this is a place you should visit. Make sure you visit both parks and try to book your tickets in advance as you may get it at a much lower price. DON'T buy it from Disneyland's site, it is a rip off (about 70 pounds). Get it from other websites. Got mine from Attractiontix for 54 pounds and this included a fastpass too!",Disneyland_Paris
192965197,2,2014-1,United Kingdom,"I would strongly advise against staying at Disneyland Hotels. Spent a week at tge Seqouia Lodge. The smell of cannabis was overwhelming. After several complaints and threats to announce it to other guests, the security staff and manager begrudgingly attended and agreed, but said there was nothing they could do. Was offered same room elsewhere rather than them tackling a noticeable drug issue. Very poor service and staff were far from satisfactory.The park itself was tired to say the least.",Disneyland_Paris
192891513,5,2014-1,United Kingdom,I love the Disneyland Paris Park and have visited many times and each time I've never come away disappointed. We visited Sunday to Thursday last week in January 2014 as we know the park at the weekends is much busier so long queue times. The longest we queued for rides was approx. 5 to 10 minutes. We did wait 45 minutes to 1 hour to see Snow White in the Princess Parlour but worth the wait to see my grand daughter's face light up.One thing I do feel that Disney should address is the lack of indoor eating areas at this time of year. There are a lot of food outlets in the park that are closed and the ones that are open don't provide a great number of seating areas. You can go to the village but that means leaving the park. I've always found the staff to be very friendly and helpful.,Disneyland_Paris

The decos were wonderful and we were lucky that it was a lovely clear day. There were not a lot of food kiosks opened as it was off season. The queues were reasonable on the day we went. We purchased some lovely Christmas decorations as memories of our trip. I think I may have had more fun than the  kids,Disneyland_Paris

We got there as the park opened and stayed right through the final show. Incredible crowds though   if this was low season, cannot imagine what peak will be like! The parades and shows are a must   the end of day light show was very good. The FastTrack (I think that was what it was called) queue system worked very well and we would recommend it. We bought a day pass to both parks but only had time to do the main Disney Park   there was just so much to see and do. The trains were convenient as they stopped at the gates of the park   despite what looked like a good crowd at the end of the night show, we had no trouble getting onto the trains to Paris. Food is not the greatest in the cafe's and is not cheap   we would bring our own food next time. The whole day was seriously not cheap   trains   tickets   food, but well worth it.",Disneyland_Paris
192460539,1,2014-1,United Kingdom,"I took my parents my sister and brother in law his father and my nieces to Disneyland Paris for a three night stay we chose the New York hotel because it's the second closest to the park ( a 10 minute walk according to the official write up but more like 15 to 20 with young kids )while I have only minor problems with the hotel like the hot water was slow to come through and the breakfast wasn't exactly piping hot being buffet that's not the reason that I'm writing this reviewI'm writing this review because of how dissatisfied I was with the park and the service I received my stay was between the 23rd and the 26th of jan 2014 what should have been a quite time of year for the resort and was told at the time of booking that some of the attractions would be closed for repairs but by no means were we told about all the closures On the day we traveled to the resort upon checking our bags in to the disney fast track in the train station my sister asked for the kids travel packs that were advertised on the internet only to find out that they stopped giving them out the month before.That night we found out just how much food in the village costs and how bad Annette's diner was I work in catering and know that cooking a burger isn't rocket science and    18.99 was I little steep for a burger, chips (fries) and a desert (chocolate brownie and ice cream) this kind of pricing continued throughout the resort and everywhere they accepted food vouchers the food was less then desirable The next day in the park I was shocked at the amount of people walking around the park smoking and when I brought this up with a staff member I was told that there is smoking area's but they don't tell anyone off as it may cause friction with the guests this of cause left a lot of butt's on the floor all over the parkOn the second full day (a Saturday) there was a huge increase in the amount of people in the park (only to be expected) and the queue times displayed were the same as the previous days thinking that Disney was showing they're remarkable skill in the movement of people I didn't think anything of it until trying to go on a ride at which point I found that the posted times were optimistic to say the leastAgain on Saturday while walking from the castle down Main Street my sister my father and myself all caught a whiff of pot being smoked in the park we pointed this out to a staff member who was putting out the posts and rope reddy for the parade that was starting in the next half hour or so and nothing was done this was an unbelievable reaction for a company that in Florida wouldn't give someone time to light up a cigarette before asking them (rather firmly) to move to a smoking areaOn Sunday after watching the program top ten things to do in disney on the in room tv my niece wanted to visit the princesses  like the little girl did on the telly  thinking that one queue allowed us to see them all as depicted in the program and after being in the queue for just under two hours ( 60 minutes shown on time board outside) we see one princess only and was told that if we wanted to visit the other one we had to queue againUpon complaining to customer services (guest relations) and filling out a complaint form we were offered the kids activity pack that we was supposed to get before getting on the train or our choice of ride tickets (to avoid the whole queue system) if we didn't file the complaintThey tried to buy us off to drop the complaint and that was as we all agreed was the most unforgivably un disney thing they could have done",Disneyland_Paris

192386100,4,2013-2,United Kingdom,"We went there in September 2012, taking advantage of the 20th Anniversary offer ticket 1 day 2 parks (51 GBP per person). It was our first time, and the place is awesome, you get to enter into your childhood cartoon world, simply amazing! However I strongly advise you not to eat there, if you can bring your own food, sandwiches or whatever you like. It is fine to get snacks all over the park but if you want to seat and eat lunch and or dinner you will lose precious time for which you can queue to visit the attractions. It is phisically impossible to visit all the two parks in one day, I think maybe you would need three days for the two of them. There are too many people, especially on weekends and over Summer, and even if there are these  fast queue  systems in which you can book your place in advance it still takes a lot of time. Also I would suggest to attend to one or two shows, they are definetely worth it!All in all it was an amazing experience!! One note: in some cases (in think during weekends in Summer) the park closes late at midnight, but if like us you went there by train either from Paris or from the very close Marne la Vall  e there won't be trains available at closure time and you will have to get a cab! It is not that expensive but definitely not as cheap as the train so keep that in mind!",Disneyland_Paris
192328779,5,2014-1,United Kingdom,"We went here in Jan 2014, if you are thinking of going go in a quiet month like we did as most of the rides were only 5 minutes wait and there was lots of room in the park and not much queing either to see Micky and co. All the rides were open and we spent two days in this area as there is so much to do, also a must see for the children is the parade down the main street, its a bit like a carnival but very well done, I think the times may differ so check whilst your there. The food is expensive and so are the drinks so we took a flask and drinks with us, but if you can look out for the all inclusive type deals that we got which includes breakfast and dinner at the hotel, in our case was Sante Fe and tokens for lunch in the park. I added up our total meal costs over our three day stay and if we had paid for it it would have been approx   250, over half of our trip fee, so look out for the deals.",Disneyland_Paris
192152525,5,2014-1,Australia,"Loved every minute of it! My sister literally dragged me there   I was very skeptical   she also had to dragggg me out! What a wonderfully unexpected experience I had!My advice: Transport : catch the train there   cheap, cheerful and eassssy. DO NOT get a taxi. I wouldn't waste money on a transfer but I understand for some this might be easierTickets : Get a 2 park ticket. If you have the time, allocate 2 days   trust me it will be worth it. Buy your tickets from any tourist info outlet in Paris beforehand as they are roughly 10 euros cheaper than at the Park, per Park. Not a huge saving but you can better use that money for train tickets or trinkets.Food: Pack some snacks. Lunch isn't really hugely more expensive than most Paris lunches.Time to visit: off season, on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Our line wait times were 5 minutes! 5 minutes! Most of all, allow yourself to be free and have a great time. Appreciate the vision of Walt Disney and have the experience he wished for every individual who went to one of his parks.Also, STAY for the light show. It was the BEST light show I have ever seen!!! Better than London NYE fireworks (almost, not quite).Enjoy!",Disneyland_Paris

I highly recommend going in January if you're looking for a bargain. I was slightly concerned that we would spend the whole time waiting in long queues but this was not the case, we always got on the rides within five minutes if not quicker. Unfortunately not all of the rides were open but nevertheless we still had a fantastic time and the Disney Dreams show of an evening was a lovely ending to a magical day. Sadly, there was an extreme lack of manners from some people. On more than one occasion my children were pushed out of the way so that grown adults could get on a ride get to a character quicker which was irritating to say the least. I'm 5 10 and was walking through one of the shops only for a shop worker to push me out of the way, i turned to confront her and she pointed rudely at the floor, it seemed that she had dropped a piece of paper and i'd had the audacity to step on it (i hadn't seen it).

191512813,5,2013-7,Nigeria,"I looooooove Disney land! And I especially love Eurodisney. Because it's small enough that you don't feel like you are on an endurance trek and because there is so much to see and do. If you plan on visiting for 3 days or more, I would advise that you buy an annual pass for    199. Because you get a discount on everything you buy in the park AND you get free parking which would cost around    20 per day. The discount is applied on food, toys and souvenirs etc. Disney land Paris is a great place for children and adults alike! Oh and with annual pass you can buy discounted tickets for up to 4 people I think. But those tickets are only valid for one day. While you are in the area, make sure to eat at the buffet in the Disney land hotel because all the characters make rounds. So you can take pictures with Mickey, Minnie and the gang!",Disneyland_Paris

191420574,1,2013-12,United Kingdom,"I had the unfortunate experience of taking my young daughters to Disneyland Paris over the Christmas period.NEVER EVER AGAIN!Firstly, we were greeted by a huge protest after entering the ticket turnstiles. All the cleaners were complaining over pay. Now I'm all for a peaceful protest but smashing the front of the park up with metal poles and rods, whilst adorning the welcome to Disney sign with every possible item of rubbish is hardly my idea of  welcome to the magic  that is Disney. If you really think that you should continue with this moniker then I'd suggest you better handle these incidents. This left my youngest distraught and my oldest wanting to never return again, preferring to go to bloody Thorpe park!.Secondly, the park just looks dated and unclean. A good example being in Discovery land where it was absolutely filthy. It looked as though the park has been desolate and neglected. The Star Tours jet was covered in muck. You wouldn't see such a poor showing in Disney world Florida.Thirdly, Customer Service. OH MY WORD. There was a huge queue at the customer services department due to many visitors undoubtedly being just as p!$$ed off as I was. To make matters worse I witnessed a gentleman frustrating his anger just to be laughed at by the supervisor in customer services. If it were me I'd have throttled the bloke. I've always associated Disney with great customer service where they can't do enough for you (of course within reason) and where they are polite at all costs and service is with a smile. The poorer Paris counterparts are in dire need of some training. Ridiculous is all I can say. Fourthly, Character showings were poorly organized though most of the characters were incredibly pleasant. Finally, I found the restaurants to be incredibly pricy and the food lacking any real quality. I don't think I've ever experienced food so poor in what is meant to be one of the country's of choice for cuisine. I know this is a theme park so the standards shouldn't be too high, but nevertheless it was just not up to scratch. Went for a meal at planet Hollywood in downtown Disney and the service was great and food quality much improved.There were plus points like the service at cafe mickey but my advise is to go to Florida. save some extra cash and experience what Disney should actually stand for. Even when complaining the customer service team could only offer a days complimentary passes. Quite frankly I'd pay not to go there again!!! Florida yes, California yes, Paris HELL NO!!!Appalled!!!",Disneyland_Paris
191395200,5,2014-1,Malta,We spent a day in Disneyland during our 5 day stay in Paris. Although we are both 50 year olds we enjoyed every minute of the day spent there! We managed to do some interesting rides as well especially the big thunder mountain which was full of thrills!! No wonder everyone who goes there says you'll feel like a young kid once more!! We really weished we had more time to spend there but at least we are satisfied with what we've managed to do in a whole day!! When we return to Paris we will definitely return to Disneyland!!,Disneyland_Paris
191351581,3,2014-1,United Kingdom,Always book a taxi from and to the airport; you arrive without any stress at your Disney hotel. The trains are too difficult with the steps and double decker design. Avoid weekends. Locate the toilets if you are travelling with young children. Plan your day. The whole complex including the hotel Cheyenne needs an update and over haul. Shuttle bus a nightmare with the pushing and shoving. Little ones get crushed in the stampede. In the park there are not enough 'characters' to see. They keep taking breaks and the wait to see ONE princess was one hour   we were led to believe that there would be several princess characters inside! The staff are not helpful and do not seem to have any knowledge of the set up. The Disney no smoking policy in all the parks is not adhered to and this is frustrating when waiting for rides to have smoke puffed all over the little children. The Park delivers the dream to the children. They loved it. For the adults it is a costly visit.....,Disneyland_Paris
191247255,5,2013-7,United States,Disneyland is the best. No matter what age you are once you enter through the gates you are a child again. What was even better was that I was able to see the joy in the eyes of grandchildren as they enjoyed the magic of Disneyland.,Disneyland_Paris
191245251,4,2013-7,United States,"Paris alone has enough attractions, however, if you happen to have children or adolescents Disneyland Paris could be a good negotiating tool.You can say, if we go to  X  in Paris and don't complain, I'll take you to Disney.This park is not very big with makes it very comfortable for a day trip and a few hours visit.Obviously, it does not have as many attractions as the American parks, however, our teenagers had a lot of fun. The only disappointment was the M.J. Captain Eo attraction, it was sad to see how corny this movie was and how primitive the special effects were at the time.",Disneyland_Paris
191243100,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"We visited in September then again in December for Christmas. It was my first time visiting after wanting to go since being a little child! Disneyland passed all my expectations and I really miss it now. Even as an adult the characters are happy to have photos with you and I must have been the only adult with an autograph book. There was little queues as we visited mid week both times. The parades are our favourite part, the characters have so much energy very time. I can only say good things about Disneyland!",Disneyland_Paris
191226507,5,2014-1,United Kingdom,"Upon arrival at the Disney park, it was just incredible! It's true what they say, it's definitely a magical world   you literally feel like you're not on earth anymore!All the little old fashioned styled shops and all the magic that they have to offer, to the amazing attractions and parades   this is just the perfect place to get away.Every night there is a show called 'Disney Dreams' which everyone that visits Disneyland Paris HAS GOT to see, it's the most amazing thing ever   all different Disney films are incorporated together and projected on to the main Sleeping Beauty castle with an array of fireworks, fountains and lights   this begins at 7pm every night, but be sure to get there about 10 to 15 minutes before hand if not a bit earlier, just to ensure you don't miss anything   all ages will be blown away by this, words cannot describe how good it is.There is also a parade that is carried out along Main street USA every day at 5pm, which sees all different Disney films made into parade floats that crowd the street   this is another thing that definitely shouldn't be missed and is great for all ages!On the rides side of things, there are so many to write about   my top three would probably have to be 1. Thunder mountain   thrilling and eye opening! 2. It's a small world   calming and enchanting and 3. Pirates of the Caribbean   Magical and exciting. However all the rides in this park are just incredible and I hope you all get to try them all out!For the thrill seekers, I'd thrown space mountain into that mix also!The only downside about the park was that we had a ticket to get access to the park 2 hours earlier that normal meaning we could enter at 8am, however when we were in there at 8am along with all the other Disney goers, there were no rides what so ever open and about 2 stores open and that was it, so it was quite a long time for us to wait before any rides opened (10am)   but other than that the park was incredible!Be sure to take some of your own snacks if you're on a budget as things can get quite pricey!Hope you all enjoy!",Disneyland_Paris
191226012,4,2014-1,United Kingdom,"The walkway up to the gates were nice with the garden containing views of the hotel and park with fountains.When we got through the gates we were fortunate to see the Christmas lights and trees still up which were really impressive. The view of the castle from the entrance is still breath taking whilst walking up Main Street.We were fortunate that Captain EO was open on our first day, because on further visits this attraction was closed. Big Thunder Mountain nearly made me lose my voice with screaming in the dark drops in the tunnels. Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast in our opinion is the best ride in the park.We were very lucky that until Friday the park was fairly empty so the longest we had to queue was 10 minutes for Star Tours, never known the queues to be so short this made the days even better.The Disney Magic on Parade was really good, got very close to all of the characters. We were lucky enough to be walking through an arcade (sheltering from the rain) and was approached by Minnie Mouse which was a very nice surprise.During the evening we saw Disney Dreams which can only be described as FANTASTIC.",Disneyland_Paris
191221870,5,2013-12,Ireland,"Spent three Days in Disneyland, Paris just a week before Christmas with my wife, daughter & granddaughter. Absolutely fantastic experience. Magical for folks of all ages. When you walk through the entrance gates under the arch into Main Street, the Christmas tunes, the wonderful tree, the stores all decorated for the season, you just knew that this place is something special at this time of the year. When darkness fell, the lights, the lighting of the Christmas Tree, the Water & Lights show at the Castle.....this is a world that we all wished existed in real life. Of course it's not real but a dose of fantasy has to be enjoyed and Disney manage to bring you into the make believe world thats full of magic and goodness and you can't help but just get sucked into it. A world where would wish our kids & grandkids could live in. The place is spotless, the staff are courteous and helpful at all times. The attractions are superb, there a lots of fun rides for kids of all ages, obviously there are certain rides where height restrictions are applicable but there is still enough for the small kiddies. My Grandaughter is 2 years old and to see her little face mesmerised by Princess Sophie whilst dancing with her was just priceless.The Downside.....there has to be a downside guys ( I'm not known as a grumpy old so & so for nothing)... it's gonna cost you when you get there. It's fierce expensive inside but would you expect anything less. Eating is expensive but value can be found, i.e. Buzz Lightyears Pizzaria, or the New Yorker Fast Food cafe just outside the complex. You will not do Disneyland on a tight budget, it's just not possible. Sure, you can cut a few corners here & there but they get ya somewhere else. It's just not the place to play Scrooge.The dreaded Queue: Well I'm NOT one for a queue. The park was not as packed as it might be in the summer months hence the queing wasn't too bad. Personally I would not be interested in Disneyland in the summer months cos I would not queue & I suppose the age I'm at the heat would not be too welcome either. With regard to the costs I have to admit that there is some justification in the high prices. I spoke to some of the staff, none are on minimum wage, all are on a good wage and they are professional at all times and they appear to enjoy the job and those I spoke to said they loved woring in the place. The park employs 14,000 people, what a pity they didn't come to Ireland all those years ago. A shortsighted Irish government perhaps or maybe the pull of the powerful French lobby. However, just to put it out there, Disneyland is like New York, it's recession proofThe environment must be the envy of local authorities for two reasons. 1. the cleanliness of the place & 2. The budget that must be available to keep the place clean. Recommended length of stay, you need 5 full days to get to everything in but we crammed a lot into our 3 days. If you decide to visit Disneyland you will have a great time. If you are a young couple just married, no kids? there is no need to wait for the kids to arrive, do it yourself you can bring the kids of the future in the future. If you are an old crony like myself, don't put it on a bucket list, get there whilst your legs wcan still carry you, you won't regret it. Just be carefull of those coaster rides, make sure you have your teeth well cemented in especially on Indiana Jones.....and the fast emptying wallet:)Would I go again? If I was to go to Disneyland again it would definitely be before Christmas again cos the themes are geared for the holiday season and it is most enjoyable. I do enjoy Christmas.",Disneyland_Paris

191143782,5,2014-1,Ireland,"From the moment we stepped through the gates, walked up beautiful Main Street and caught our first glimpse of the castle, it was just magical, loved every minute of our five day trip to the parks, we did all the rides except three that were closed those days. Our family favourites were Big Thunder Mountain, Star Tours, Pirates, Space Mountain, but enjoyed all.We travelled during the week and off season so queues were short, but by Saturday a huge difference, people everywhere and long wait times. Peter Pan ride broke down one morning but we were quickly issued fast passes by cast members and returned later.Met lots of characters, yes we had to wait but was well worth it, having five days gave us lots of time to do everything without feeling rushed. Duffy and Tigger were very entertaining.Parade was wonderful, got a spot 30 minutes before, and the same for the Disney Dreams show at park closing time, it is truly breathtaking, don't miss it!All in all we had a fantastic family experience, can't wait to go back, great for the kids and for the child in all of us, just go with flow......and enjoy the magic.",Disneyland_Paris
191133494,4,2014-1,United Kingdom,The park was immaculate when we visited and we throughly enjoyed our time in this park. The planting and attention to details was really very good and that's difficult to achieve with plants and trees at this time of year. The park offered something for all our party aged from 2 to 60 and the parades and fireworks every night were spectacular. The thing that really disappoints is the quality and PRICE of the food available in the park. I don't mind paying high prices for good food BUT I do object to paying ridiculous prices for awful cheap processed rubbish food. If it weren't for this I would give the park 5 stars.,Disneyland_Paris
191093440,5,2014-1,United Kingdom,"Okay, so I'm a 24 year old male who loves football and I envisioned Disneyland as one of them places that I would never see myself going, I mean why would I want to go there? It's for little children & wannabe princesses right? WRONG. Ha!I went with my Girlfriend who I took as a treat, she loves all of the Disney kind of stuff! So I'm a nice guy & I decided why not, she deserves it. Leading up to going I was dreading it, 'what have I got myself in for? I'm going to be so bored.'Went to Disneyland on the Saturday, walked through the gates & it looked amazing. Then I lined up to see Minnie for 20mins, oh the joys. I thought this going to be one of them days.. Wandering along.. And hello Space Mountain, day complete. I didn't know the place was full of rides, it was good.I mean okay I didn't enjoy lining up to meet a princess for an hour lol, but I enjoyed all the silly little rides like the buzz light year one, I felt like a child again lol. I watch Captain EO, was good. Just everything was better than I expected.,I suppose you've got to be there to understand. It's just a giant busy theme park lol, not a secluded Disney Island occupied with screaming children.The parade was mint! And the Disney dreams at the end of the evening was amazing, nothing comes close to how detailed it was and magical.I spent a fortune on Crepes and Waffles, but who cares? WHEN IN ROME.The prices are going to be a little higher at these type of places, when they use about 400 fireworks each night lol. Accommodate enough money & enjoy yourself regardless of your age.America next! :)CONS: toilets were vile, some of the rides were closed & a lot of fast food rather than nice meals.",Disneyland_Paris

I called in advance to request this be changed (a simple process at the tourism company I used to work for) and this now seems but impossible as their system won't allow it.

Extremely unsatisfied with this service.",Disneyland_Paris
190884433,5,2014-1,Ireland,"most things are said in other reviews but I have to say that it isn't that expensive if you know where to save.of course I would avoid the high season. I have been there beginning of june 2009 and im going next month again. as a single mother I have to go for as cheap as I can. my son is now 13. he pays adult rates but we got ryan air flights for about 80 euros each for the return flight. accommodations for about 25 30 euros per night per room if u choose one outside Disneyland noisiel and bussy st georges for example, about 20 min away by metro and there are restaurants, take aways, supermakets where its a lot cheaper to get food. in Disneyland and paris in general I drink much water from water dispensers. there are plenty. entry tickets are a lot cheaper on French sites. all this saves a lot.the entry is still not the cheapest. the cheapest tickets I found are 39 euros per adult (1 day, 1 parc) or 49 euros (1 day, 2 parcs). but we shouldn't forget what other fun parcs cost or a simple fun fair where you pay for the single ride. in Disneyland u spend the whole day and it has much to offer. attractions for everyone, great parades, amazing firework, the Disney characters. the time we went in june, we even didn't had to wait too long in the queues. I found it fine enough as its only 1 eurodisney and people from many countries show up, so of course its not empty. if you spend a few days there you can skip the parades if you have already seen them. in that time you can have many rides without waiting because most people will be watching the parades. food is expensive but I saw that in many bigger fun parcs too. some sandwiches you can bring in with no bother and like I mentioned before, if the accommodation is outside its wiser to have proper dinner somewhere in the area you stay. if your trip has to be as cheap as possible, this little info hopefully helps a bit and the fun in the parc is the same. if ur on low or high budget :)I simply love it thereplease forgive my English. im german :D",Disneyland_Paris
190876083,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Visited last year whilst camping nearby. We have 2 little girls who are obsessed with everything Disney so bought the tickets as a surprise. We were definitely not disappointed! The main entrance is fabulous, and the whole park is extremely well designed. The characters walking around are brilliant. Most rides are great but as the day wore on the queues got pretty big. Very expensive for food and in the gift shops but this was expected (who goes to Disneyland expecting a cheap day out??) Quite hard to get an autograph & we only managed 2   Mickey Mouse who we had to queue up for over an hour to meet (but they did have cartoons on a big screen inside an old fashioned theatre whilst you waited) and Aurora (be warned   you have to queue at a specific time to get a ticket for the princesses   we sent Dad while we went on a ride   then return at another specified time to queue again for approx. 15 mins to meet one of two princesses). However it was worth every second of queuing just to see my daughters' faces when they met them both!The girls have asked for the past 6 months when we are going back, and we definitely intend to return many times before they grow too old to enjoy it!",Disneyland_Paris
190827846,2,2014-1,United Kingdom,"Had a long weekend in Paris and thought a day out to Disneyland would be a perfect addition to our trip, however at the end of the day we wished we had stayed in the city for the day instead! Very expensive to get there on the train, then very very expensive to get in so already feeling a bit negative, so we went to get some food from the little pizza restaurant in 'fantasyland.' The food was horrible. It was over cooked and tasted awful, and we paid    25ish for 2 small, rubbery meals. Used some nearby restrooms as well, and these were some of the most disgusting toilets i have ever been in! Had to use multiple toilet seat covers, and when needed again, I just waited to use the much nicer toilets on the train on the way home, and I don't often find train toilets preferable to anywhere!We then decided to queue for some rides, however not once but twice were we suddenly ushered out of queues along with everyone else by grumpy, rude workers who upon questioning revealed that the rides had broken down and our 30 minutes of queuing had been for absolutely nothing. We found ourselves thinking that if they can't manage to keep the rides working in the winter, then why keep the park open and charge extortionate prices? We wasted well over an hour queuing for these 2 rides that we never got to go on, and there was no apology or explanation from the staff unless pressed. Felt a lot like a waste of money and will not be going again, and would advise people to really think twice about whether they can face the queuing, because even if you queue for a long time there is no guarantee you'll get on the ride, as they can't seem to keep them operational!",Disneyland_Paris

The place is kept really clean the only issue I had and that is why it wasnt given the 5 star was the toliets in the park. I know there is such a high volume of people going through them in a day but some of them were really bad and I turned and came out of a few before going to the loo and looked for cleaner ones.

The fast pass system is interesting (especially because its free and not only for the fortunate visitors) since it can save you a lot of time. Nevertheless, some attractions does not have this system (e.g. Crush Coaster) and I think it's not very convenient for families with small children since you've to plan and walk a lot.On one day, we could do the following attractions:Big Thunder Mountain RailroadSpace Mountain  : Mission 2The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror   Rock 'n' Roller Coaster starring AerosmithCrush's Coaster  Armageddon : les Effets Sp  ciauxCaptain EOPhantom ManorStar ToursCin  MagiqueBuzz Lightyear Laser Blast",Disneyland_Paris

190340890,2,2013-11,United States,"Having read some rather unflattering reviews before hand I nevertheless had an open mind on the day a friend and I went to the Park on a very chilly, windy November day.The train getting there is very easy. You can buy your tickets from the GREEN kiosk or if, as in our case, they are out of order go to the ticket window. Buy tickets   ours cost about 12 euros each rt   then go to the lower track and follow the well marked signs for the Park. The train was clean and we saw several passengers that were going to the Park as well but mostly it was just the everyday person going about their business. Trip takes about 45 minutes. The train arrives at the Station and as you exit the Park is right there so no lengthy hikes to reach.There is a sort of Disney Village with a Hard Rock Restaurant , shops etc on the left as enter. The main entrance is underneath one 'wing' of the Hotel. No line paid 84 euro each for one park ticket. Enter directly onto Main Street. Basically the same deco but was outfitted for Christmas with a huge tree nicely decorated. Shops on both sides. It also  snows  as intervals! We went into a cafe there for something warm to drink. Pretty adverage and bit expensive. Hot cold beverages, pastries etc. Then there was a Parade of sorts. Sadly, it was pretty bad and that was the only time we ever saw any themed characters at all. Not one roaming about the Park at all.Then we went to FrontierLand where the Haunted Mansion is located as well as Mark Twain River boat and I guess Big Thunder Mountain. Something was smelling wonderful    .. We went on the Haunted Mansion ride with zero wait time. The usual with some  French  Touches here and there and the Guide was very nice. That smell? Barbecue from the only restaurant open in that section. We read the menu: Buffalo Burger platter with salad, french fries and a drink totaled $40.00 American. Really. Needless to say we skipped.Next was Adventureland. Closed. All of it. Rides, attractions. Only things open were something akin to Tom Sawyer's Island and Indian Jones Ride. WE then headed to Pirates of the Caribbean which was open. It's designed more like a Fort in Port Royale and not in any way like the Park in California. I have not seen Florida so cannot comment about that one. Ride is basically the same with a few things added to make it more  French. FantseyLand next. The thing one has to remember is that the size is much SMALLER here that in Ca or Florida! Hunger drove us and the only thing open was a restaurant so in we went. Really bad. A cheeseburger, fries, drink and small ice cream was 12 euros each. It came cold but management provides a microwave in which to re heat. How thoughtful! Mostly full of families with cold and tired kids and parents' longing to go home.Next was the section like Space Mountain. Nothing to be thrilled there at all.The second and last Parade of the day begins at 5:30 or so and start to the left of Sleeping Beauty's Castle. This one featured 5 7 floats with Themed Characters both on them and walking. Best of the two. The Park closed this section at 7 as they have a fireworks show. We did not stay.Made our way back to Main Street did some shopping in too crowed last minuted packed stores before we left and took the train back into Paris. The Park itself is in need of A LOT of cosmetic work. Seriously.I'm glad we went because now it's out of my system and I can say to anyone that wants to gush about how they just 'have to go  Please, rethink! Spend your Euros on true Eye candy!But then, if you're a family with very young kids, who don't care about high prices shabby upkeep and horrible priced everything, then by all mean go.",Disneyland_Paris
190301692,4,2013-11,Finland,"This park actually felt like beeing in original park in Orlando. Staff was delightful and rides were working. Disney magic could be felt here. During November, there was no lining what so ever.",Disneyland_Paris
190230995,4,2013-12,United Kingdom,"We were a party of 11 (6 adults and 5 children aged between 3 and 11) and spent 15 hrs on the park on News Year Eve and 10hrs on New Years Day. It was our first visit and the trip was a surprise Christmas Present for the children. There were some magical moments like the Christmas Tree show and the celebratory light show and fireworks over Sleeping Beauty's Castle. Upside was there were plenty of attractions, downside was the queuing (we did do a few FREE fast passes which was of enormous benefit) and also cost of food.   22 for 2 ham and chess baguettes a bit OTT but they were fresh and tasty. TIP: Programme guide ESSENTIAL (free with the maps at entrance) if you don't want to miss the parades and shows. Overall everyone enjoyed this different New Year and 3 yr old comment after every ride  awesome .",Disneyland_Paris
190226625,2,2013-11,Netherlands,"Maybe it's a blast for very young children, but for adults it's a burden. The park is very poor maintained, food level is like Mcdonalds but 5x more expensive, waiting time should be calculated in hours and what amazed me the most is that there are hardly any Disney figures walking around in the park. So if you want to go to a Disneypark, choose Florida, USA; more fun, friendly employees and it's sunny : ) Oh, before people should think what a sour comment... I have year passes!",Disneyland_Paris
190192662,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"visited again in December 13, have been going to the park most years for about 15 years, always something new to see, next year Ratatouille ride, went the weekend before xmas so busy in the park, always go to the most popular rides first or wait till late, make good use of fast pass tickets. we always get a fast pass for a busy ride, then queue for another by which time you fast pass will be valid and will get on quickly for the other ride, try to pick a day when the park is open till 10pm that way after about 7pm a lot of people with young children leave and the last few hours are quiet, check the disney website in advance to see what rides are going to be closed for maintenance this tends to be after the busy periods like January this is also when they tend to give offers! Great parades and night shows , best rides for over 14s to older people are space mountain, rock and roll coaster, indiana jones, crush's coaster. buzz lightyear. for younger ones visit fantasy land for rides like peter pan dumbo snow white etc, for all ages pirates of the Caribbean, moteurs action stunt show, haunted mansion etc, all in all a great day out.",Disneyland_Paris

Disney land was magical for anyone of any age, I loved how everything was themed, nothing wasn't disney, the rides were fantastic even for adults. But mostly you can enjoy being at disney land by just taking it all in, we walked around the park which has different themed areas. I loved that the restaurants were those out of Disney films, it's just added to the experience, I spent a lot in the shops at Disney land but it wasn't overpriced and it ranged from small things to big things for every budget.",Disneyland_Paris
190140238,4,2014-1,United Kingdom,"very shocked at reading some of the previous reviews as we felt the Christmas spirit was great and the decorations were amazing! however it was our 1st time here so maybe its been better previous?we visited on friday 3rd jan. didn't arrive till midday as we were so tired from travelling the day before and well wish we would of gone when the park opened as it was SO busy and ques for all ride were 40 mins to 2 hours. (hard work with a 2 year old). We literally were able to go on a handful of rides but go so fed up of french locals (the ones that beg for money in paris) pushing there way through ques. So unfair really think Disney should have staff manning some ques as this was unacceptable. They stand in the que, push there child through to another part under the ropes and then walk up the que past people pointing at the child as if ton say they are with them. quite a few people noticed what was going on as well as us and confronted them but they just laughed and were SO rude it was shocking. so be aware of this and always move up and leave no spaces as they really do take the p*** out of people doing this!the walk into disney was lovely the decorations were fab and main st USA looked magical. as soon as we got in the park we heard the parade was 10 mins so we stuck around and got a front kerb space. the parade was amazing, although a little short only about 3 floats   mickey,minnie and pluto, toy story, donald duck and santa with character in between. We were very happy to have watched it though but we were expecting it to be much longer after watching disney parades prior to visit on youtube. the weather was good and wasn't too cold so that was a bonus for us.we ate at the golden nugget which is a non reservation restaurant   you Que you go in order pay then are seated and food is with you withing mins. they do set meals (burger chips drink and dessert) for about 14 euros which is good. the meal was good, better than usual fast food and you got good portion sizes. I know alot of people complain about the price of food but we though this was quite good and c'mon your in disney what do you expect?! there were other restaurants we went to before but were fully booked (a steakhouse I cant remember the actual name) and there is also cheaper options too but this was ideal for us to have a bit of timeout and a recharge. there was a band playing and the atmosphere was nice.one thing we missed were the programmes as you enter the park that tell you where the characters will be at set times, our little girl REALLY wanted to see Minnie but we just couldn't find her. we left after 6 as our LO was so tired and did well to stay awake all day so we missed the fireworks as they weren't until 10.Realistically you do need 2 days here and it is better to stay at disney so you can get in early and if you stay at a disney hotel you get extra park hours.the Disney village was lovely and we really wished we stayed there as it was much nicer than staying in paris itself.you do need alot of money but i guess you could take a packed lunch and do it on a budget, my advice would be to to take extra money eat there and do the whole experience as seating was few and far between. the gift shops were great and we went a little overboard but again, its unlikely we will come back for a long time so you may as well get what you want.the staff we found were good and not too grumpy but one thing that that I wasn't happy with was when we were choosing some gloves for our daughter, the lady was in such a rush to get the money in the till, (there was nobody else to be served) I had asked her to wait for a moment as i needed to find the size and whilst we were going round the stall looking she told my partner we had got the size so he paid for the items and then when I said to her we don't want the gloves they are way too big (which she must of known as our daughter is 2 and they only come in sizes 7 10) she couldn't process a refund and we had to walk out of our way to a completely different shop to get it authorised.overall a good day but go early and on a weekday. cant imagine what the ques are like weekends!",Disneyland_Paris
190138679,5,2013-12,Netherlands,"For our first time, we (two adults and one 5 year old girl) went to Disneyland Paris on christmas. We have been warned by many people about this period. They said it was waaay to busy, never ending queues, etc. We arrived on the 25th of December, at     10:00 am after checking in the Disneyland Hotel (main hotel at the entrance)In short; Yes. it was very busy and yes, there were many long queues by the time we where in the park. However it was absolutely worth it! The  magic  of Disney and Christmas was totally there, despite the number of people. Our daughter absolutely adored every minute of it. Almost all the staff were very friendly and helpful. (I read in another review people incountered some infriendly staff) The queues where acceptable for us. Some tips. 1. If you arrive via the Charles de Gaule airport (CDG) take the fast train (TGV) to the park! It's the same price as one of the bus, but it only takes 10 minutes! The bus takes (depending on traffic) at least 1.5 hours to get there.2. A reviewer suggested to bring a pram   childrens push chair (not sure if that's the right word, but I hope you know what I mean) We haven't used ours since more then one year, as our daughter can do without it fine. However it was very usefull to have one with us. By the end of the day she was really tired, but because of the pram, we could still go to the parade and fireworks show! (You can also rent them at the park)3. The Disney hotel is much more expensive, but they have special offers sometime (we had 40% off) It is worth the extra money; You get a fast pass, and you can enter the park at 8:00am, while it opens to the public at 09:30am. As we where exhausted at the end of the day, so we where glad our hotel was around the corner (the hotel was nice too)4. If you stay at the main hotel, consider a premium pass (60 euro pp.) especially on busy days. This will shorten your waiting time considerably. (we didn't do it though)5. Meeting with Disney characters. You can fix a meet and greet with one of the Disney characters (either Mickey, or one of the princesses) I had to queue for like one hour. The meet and greet was less then 5 minutes (including taking pictures, etc) but our daughter was sooo impressed by the princess, she's still bringing it up every day, three weeks later :)",Disneyland_Paris
190132831,3,2013-12,Belgium,"This was our 3th visit and it will most likely be our last one.The Xmas decorations where wonderful! The closing show at 10pm was real magic; loved that one! BUT, the whole park is in pretty poor condition, with some of the attractions shutting down regularly. Not much fun if you have been standing in line, in the cold weather for way too long!Not all of the staff is friendly and they think you don't understand or speak French if you talk English. It helps to be able to change languages though, to make clear how they should treat their customers. Food and drinks are way overprized and the quality is doubtful. They should really do something about this.",Disneyland_Paris
190117923,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"Having visited 3 previous times before as a family of 4, we left for a pre Xmas visit fully aware of assorted mediocre reports on Tripadvisor and taking into account that the whole operation is a challenge to pay its way. What we found was a great surprise. The Newport Bay was fine and OK decorating, and especially the evening buffet was brilliant. 3 full days of everything both parks offered was goldchip with the thrill rides especially delivering at top level. Top rides for us were Tower of Terror, Space Mountain, Crush's Coaster(but queue too long) and Big Thuinder Mountain (but too many breakdowns   I know this doesn't happen in warm, dry Florida!). The best award goes to the closing lightshow and fireworks   too clever and fantastic to describe in words. So what started as an expensive 3 days of doubt ended as a fantastic short break incorporating great value for money, full of magical experiences and an all round brilliant experience. Extra stand out points   nearly all cast members fully injected with the Disney vibe   dedicated Eurostar from St Pancras straight to resort the best way although we've flown before   next time we stay someone might have fixed the plumbing in our bathroom. Top tip   book the dIsney hotels before you go but ask for room upgrade cost when you check in   you might have a pleasant surprise!.",Disneyland_Paris
190102702,5,2014-1,United Kingdom,"Well, i can only assume that Kim and Aggie had visited the park since some of the other reviews were posted. From what i could tell, the park was very clean and well maintained (although i must admit to not being on the lookout for dirt and grime). Yes, there are people smoking in the park, but it is in France and shouldn't be a surprise. That being said, all the staff were pleasant and smiling, and not at all surly. I think the main thing that makes or breaks a visit is the size of the crowds, and the impact it has on everything. We went from 4 7 Jan. The 4th was absolutely heaving, and you do feel like part of the herd, with huge queues. However, over the following days, things got much quieter as it entered off season. Queues were 20 minutes max, and the vast majority of rides were still running ( with all the big ones working). this made for a more relaxed experience, which no doubt is the same for those working there too.All in all, a terrific experience. Yes its not Florida levels of Disney, but then its not in Florida. But, in our experience, the Disney magic was still in abundance, and our 3 year old had an amazing time!",Disneyland_Paris
190071097,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"I have been to DLP 6 times and am well aware of the good and not so good points. I have stayed a couple of times in the Disneyland Hotel, a couple of times in the Sequoia Lodge and twice off site at Val DEurope which is only I stop away by train   1.4 euros each way. Staying at residhome val d'Europe and buying park tickets cost you approx same as staying at cheapest disney hotels however you benefit from more space, can make your own brekkie and packed lunches and drink your own cheapish booze all bought in nearby supermarket. You can order in pizza and eat nearby at lovely restaurants in val d'Europe mall. Eg a lovely meal for 4 on the Italian with soft drinks and wine was just over 50 euros. This is less than half what disney restaurants will charge. However its possible to get these benefits and still stay onsite. Next time I'm going to stay at sequoia lodge and visit val d'Europe for evening meals. Also opp to stock up on soft drinks, crisps and wine etc at supermarket. The eating out problem as far as I'm concerned is the only (big) problem with euro disney. Oh and avoid weekends seriously. I cannot believe the negative reviews about the park at Xmas time. Accept that you are not there to do every ride and just embrace the experience. It is Christmas HD. Final tip. Don't queue in park to see characters. Go to corridor in disneyland hotel outside breakfast before 10 and you'll see mickey and friends in the warmth and its perfectly allowed even if you aren't staying thereFinal final tip. Try and speak a little French to the people who work there. Think how annoyed you would be if you were expected to speak someone else's language at work every day.",Disneyland_Paris

Aside from the grumpiness of the staff , what is worse is the general poor condition of the whole place   the walk from The Disney Village car park into Disney Village looks dreadful, entering the park lots of chewing gum on the ground, poor sign writing at entry areas, inside the park rubbish on the floor   not enough cleaners, someone should repaint nearly everything, or just pressure wash and remove the algae, moss where it is not supposed to be   get someone in to do a snagging list   give them a free pass a free trip for their troubles (to Disneyland in CA though) ! Nothing in the Rock   Roller Coaster display cabinets has seen a duster since it was created in 2007  and which genius decided to only do 30 secs or so in the  studio , exiting half way (we did it twice) does not explain the whole theme of the ride   you might as well enter straight away off the street. Phenomenally disinterested unmotivated staff   only met two cast members who showed any interest (an older chap in the Tower of Terror who just happened to be passing us on a stairs and engaged us) and the cast member with Remy in the Big Stars Restaurant. Too many rides and restaurants closed when we visited 4th to 6th of Jan 2014, no excuse as they took the same money from us as during peak periods!I guess of it was a theme park in Ireland or Scotland you might say it was good, but this is Disney   Florida is well run on minimum wage, no reason why they can't do the same in Paris!Go to Florida instead   with the cost of accommodation (Disneyland hotel wanted    800  a night for one room) and food it will be equal in no time, and a more memorable holiday.Well I said my piece!",Disneyland_Paris

The atmosphere in the park is just truly magical... even with fake snow every hour on the main street!We went as a couple, and don't have any children, however we felt like kids ourselves! The parades were brilliant, and the rides even more so   however, if you are visiting during kids holidays or peak season, be aware that queues are very long! We did use the Fast Pass system to re visit rides and get on within 10 20 minutes, however times to come back for Fast Pass were also later in the day due to the volume of visitors.We ate at a few of the Disney restaurants   slightly over priced, but that's just to be expected at somewhere like this.We stayed for the closing fireworks at night which were amazing and well worth it.

189934454,3,2014-1,United Kingdom,"We visited the park for New Years Eve 2013 staying a total of 4 days. This was our fifth visit but certainly the worst. The whole point of going to Disneyland is for the magic of Disney and the whole Christmas celebrations seemed to detract from this rather than enhance this. The main Christmas themed evening display was nice to see but not as good as the one we saw on our last visit in October 2012. In addition to this the park was packed to the point where you were continuously battling your way through crowds, huge restaurant queues and massive ride queues. Nearly all the queues in the park for the large rides were way to long averaging 1.5 hours plus for most of our stay. It was also annoying to find queue jumping and people standing right up against the back of you in queues. Fast passes are a great idea but most of them joint the standard queue in a way that you felt like you were pushing in, there were no staff helping to filter you through, instead you simply had to push your way in. Not sure why the Disney Paris management thinks this is acceptable in Europe but not in the USA. The rides as ever were great fun and the themeing is second to none, but the park falls short of the Magic Kingdom in Florida and the original Disneyland park in LA. Thunder Mountain broke down on three of the four days we were in the park which was disappointing. On the last day we waited 45 minutes even with our Fast Passes due to it breaking down and reopening causing a huge backlog of people.Probably the most annoying thing about this visit (that I have never noticed before) was the vast amount of people smoking all over the park; in queues (those outside and those inside), in the toilets, parades, shows and the doorways to restaurants and shops. I have no issue with people smoking affecting their own health but if there are smoking areas people should stick to these areas. The Disney staff did not seem to challenge members of the public smoking despite no smoking signs on nearly all the queues.Will not be visiting the Paris Disneyland Park any time soon and will never visit during peak time as its not worth it as the park standards slip. If you have to go during peak time go to Florida Disney parks as they are better managed and more enjoyable.",Disneyland_Paris

All the adverts show you little girls meeting their princesses how magical. We knew going near Christmas it would be busy but we were prepared to wait, however I expected to see the characters around the park even for a few minutes given the cold weather oh no, I had to queue for an hour to get a ticket for my daughter to be given a time slot to meet a princess, yes one princess and not one of her choice, heartbreaking. The only time my daughter saw her princess was a fleeting look as she went past sitting in a carriage during the parade! This has to be the biggest most expensive rip off I have ever seen. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE YOUR DAUGHTER IF YOU WANT HER TO HAVE A MAGICAL PRINCESS EXPERIENCE, leave her with her wonderful films, dress up dresses and she won't end up broken hearted. Other issues were the food and drink prices were outrageous but i suppose this is expected for a theme park. the queues also spolit the day, 2 rides in a whole day. On a more positive note the parades were good, Main Street and the chrismas tree were great and we found the staff helpful.

The staff were not smiley, welcoming or looking to be having any fun at all, they mostly looked totally cheesed off! The cashiers at restaurants, the staff at the hotel, the guys on the rides, all of them not giving that Disney smile and service we all love. As a wheelchair user, I was not told upon booking (over the telephone) to take some proof of my disability to enable me to get a green card to allow me to use attractions! Did not find this out until we were there and then got interrogated by a rude lady in the City Hall as to what my disability was! I informed her I was paraplegic and have been for 23 years and she begrudgingly gave me the precious green card! This had to be shown everywhere including wheelchair seating areas for parades! The food is overpriced and not particularly good in the park or at the hotel Cheyenne where we stayed, I would have felt sorry for any vegetarians who, like us were faced with a choice of hot dog, hot dog, or a packt of crisps upon our hotel arrival!

Although the general standards seem to have fallen over the past few years; lack of maintenance is obvious on the pathways and in the Disney hotels, there is always a magical atmosphere in Disneyland.This was our fourth visit to the place. we stayed in New York Hotel. This is described as 4 star, but in reality is a 3 star. Rooms contain 2 double beds and can sleep four, but there is little privacy. Breakfast is acceptable. There is cooked breakfast, rashers (bacon), sausages and scrambled egg. There is a selection of cheeses and cooked meats. There are yougurts and fruit as well as bread, pastries and croissants. Hot chocolate, coffee and a selection of teas are also available. A tip would be to take some extras in your hand to take as lunch to the park and then head for dinner later.We had tickets included, but met a family who were shareholders who got better discounts.In the park, plan your visit. Some of rides had 'technical' issues and were closed. Take advantage of fastpass, where you can get priority access at a later time. If staying in the Disney hotels, you have an hour to access the park before the general public every morning.

189599733,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"We visited as a family of four in the week before Christmas when their festive celebrations were in full swing. We last went as a family 15 years ago when they were celebrating their 5th birthday...and I have to say it was every bit as magical as it was then...if not even better! For kids and grown ups alike...I can think of no more fun, spectacular and atmospheric place to visit as a family...especially leading up to Christmas.We stayed for three nights at the Newport Bay hotel, which again was very good, if not showing its age in some places. But I have to say that the park has weathered incredibly well and on the most part it looks like it was build 5 years ago...let alone 20! Everywhere was superbly clean, tidy and well decorated...and the rides, attractions etc are almost limitless...and a brilliant combination of gentle kids attractions rides and seriously grown up and clever rollercoasters. For anyone who hasn   t been, the attention to detail in the themes of each section in the park really is incredible...and all adds to the atmosphere. Ok, so it   s not perfect...there are some faults that I could pick up on. Firstly the food...yes it is very expensive and excessively long queues at busy times...but we had a big buffet breakfast at the hotel and evening meal...so didn   t really have lunch which saved us a lot. Something else I couldn   t help but notice was the amount of people smoking, which evident across the park in general. Ok so this isn   t Disney   s fault as such...but I can   t help but feel a smoking ban would be the right way forward for the park...it   s just not what you expect to see nowadays at such a family friendly attraction. Ok...so I could mention the long queues at weekends but hey, this is one of the world   s biggest theme parks so what would you expect! The queues on the Saturday when we were there were pretty long...but on the previous Wed Thurs Fri the longest queue was about 20 mins. I haven   t been to Florida Disney, but to be honest I think comparisons with that are probably unfair...Paris Disney should be judged on its own merits! My must see do attractions...Most exciting ride     Space Mountain (genuinely white knuckle stuff!)Most surprising ride     Crush   s Coaster (just give it a go...I promise you   ll be in for a surprise!)Best family ride     Pirates of the Caribbean (so clever and so atmospheric)Don   t miss     the evening light show & fireworks (the Christmas themed show we saw was truly amazing!)Tips for a great stay at Disney Paris...  Travel by Eurostar (so convenient as the station is literally 200 ft from the park gates)  Go on weekdays if at all possible (especially in busy periods)  Stay in one of the Disney hotels and have a big buffet breakfast and dinner (saves a fortune on lunches in the park)  Hotel guests are entitled to early entry into the park during the    Magic Hours   ...get up early and take advantage of it!  Do the most popular rides either first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon...so avoid the big queues in the middle of the day  Book evening meals ahead...restaurants in the village and hotels can get very busy (especially after the evening show)  Wear comfortable shoes...there   s literally miles of walking involved!",Disneyland_Paris
189578820,3,2013-12,United States,"Stayed at Disneyland just after Christmas. Have been to Disneyland Florida a couple of times but was expecting a scaled down version of the USA. I could not have been more wrong. As you entered the park we were really impressed lovely set out and main street was brill. That's where it stopped. This park is under funded and everything is out of date! The end of the night show was OK but it was a light show with minimal fireworks so was a little disappointed. I think the attractions were as old as the park itself even with a Michael Jackson themed ride... COME ON.... I don't think there was a time when all the rides were working with the pirates of the Caribbean breaking down on a daily basis. The staff were miserable, the prices were astronomical. I do expect to pay more for everything when you go to Disney but the premium you pay is for everything to be Disney this was sadly not the case, the food was average with poor service, the souvenirs are 40% dearer than bought from Disney in the UK.

We were prepared for the cold, we were prepared for the wet but what we weren't prepared for was the general attitude of the staff. Morale seemed very low and it showed. A few people were incredibly helpful, but most of the staff seemed disinterested and not particularly engaged with their roles. The cleaning staff actually went on strike on the second day we were there, decorating the courtyard with toilet paper and banging on wheelie bins. They felt underpaid and unappreciated. The park Itself was super busy, with queues everywhere; rides, restaurants, shops and toilets. Everything took a long time. We opted to go full board which was a mistake. The food was appalling; overpriced, badly presented by an obviously overwhelmed kitchen staff. As a coeliac, I was constantly presented with a choice of two microwave ready meals, beef with olives or meatballs and rice at both lunch and dinner. I did try the meatballs, which was served rather charmingly in its microwavable tray with the film still on. I didn't try it again. I was advised not to eat anything else. although Annette's Diner did prepare me a meal they said was gluten free. My tummy was uncertain afterwards but that could be because of the fact I had eaten the chocolate chip cookies I was given for breakfast(!) for lunch as I couldn't eat anything else in the park. My husband and four children were sick to death of burgers by day 2. The fast pass machine broke on two occasions and two of the more popular rides developed  faults  and closed. It wasn't good. However given that my two teenage children (19 and 17) couldn't get a mobile phone signal we actually talked properly and were able to laugh about the situation we were in. The magic of Disney did help. and my younger children (10 and 7) very much enjoyed the atmosphere and shows. However having been to Disneyland Florida, Paris is very much the poor relation. Going to be writing to see if I can get the extra money I paid for full board refunded. I think that Disney need to realise that coeliacs cannot live on cookies and cake alone.....",Disneyland_Paris
189533918,2,2013-12,United Kingdom,"This was the third visit with my family but the first since 2002. We have been to Disneyworld in Florida 3 times since our last Paris visit. Unfortunately, there appears to be no limit on how many paying customers are allowed into the park with the most popular rides having 75 90 minute waiting times. What really struck us though was how run down the whole place now looks. In the Village, the shiny Harlequin effect looks like its been in place for about 50 years. The whole place is actually dirty and I find it very hard to believe that the concrete paths are ever pressure washed. For some reason these days there are security check points everywhere which really does take away the pleasure of being there. I have also read other reviews highlighting the smoking in the parks. I agree totally. At one point while waiting for my son and daughter to return from Space Mountain, my eyes began to water because of the number of people smoking. I really do think that Disney need to re invest some of the massive amount of money they must be taking from the excessive number of daily visitors.",Disneyland_Paris
189456147,4,2014-1,India,"We visited the park for new years and thus had 15 hours at spare, yet completing all the rides was a little difficult. The park cannot be compared to Eftheling park (Netherlands) as the rides are all easy with theme based more on castles and stories, makeovers for young girls and lots of sovienier shops! The ques were long and tiring and express pass (Fast pass) facility not quite helpful. Most of the rides did not open before 2pm so we had very little to do by then.If visiting for a day, then start with Park first and then studio, try to cover the park anticlockwise and good exciting rides are on your right first. Try and first cover the Must do's first (Atleast have Fast pass for them) If you are with a child above 10, start with park and then towards end of day cover studio, else it would be good to start with Studio first. Limited food options for Vegetarians so best is to carry food along. Advisable to carry extra pair of socks and pants. Midnight new year celebration was simply awesome, with the light show and fireworks.",Disneyland_Paris
189440438,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"Before I start this place is mega and us parents enjoyed it as much as the kids (4 years old and 1). We stayed here 9 13 December and it was the perfect time of the year with the festive decorations. We parked at Ashford International and got the Eurostar to the resort terminal then it was a short bus shuttle to the Hotel Cheyenne where we stayed. Apparently flying can be a nause. These 2 (Cheyenne and Santa Fe) hotels are apparently the 'cheaper' hotels but both are spot on and have their own themes, staff and check in at both seem fast and both hotel complexes have lots of different hotel blocks, so depending which one you are put in depends on how long it takes to walk to the Parks, there is a shuttle bus to the parks but this is for lazy people who don't want to walk the 10 minutes or so to the parks. Basically hit the river at the opposite end of the entrance and turn right towards the parks or left from Santa Fe.Breakfast at our hotel was good, not a lot of choice but lots of what was there, the amount of bread rolls that each hotel goes through must be astronomical. It is obviously continental so cereals, bread, croissants, cheese, ham, preserves, fruit, etc. a lot of people, us including made up some cheese ham rolls for lunch, it saves a bit of cash (food prices to follow) and also you can eat on the go, which is handy. Believe it or not (we couldn't) there is no 'shop' anywhere on the resort, i.e somewhere that sells convenience stuff, water, milk, snacks, baby milk, there is a petrol garage just outside the Santa Fe hotel which sells most of that stuff but I had to jump on the tube to Val d'Europe to get baby powder which was only 1 stop away but a pain none the less. Now the Parks. There are 2 which slightly confused us at first, there is the Main Disneyland Park on the right as you approach and the Disney Studios on the left. Before you even get this far you have to walk through Disney Village which is a strip of restaurants, a couple of bars (inc sports bar), shops and Disney stores, this is conveniently placed as you have to walk through it at least twice day and food prices can vary from a 7 Euro Big Mac meal (on site maccies   gets very busy) to a 3 course buffet at 40 Euros a head, there are a couple of snack bars ( by the sports bar) that do pizzas for 10 bucks which are nice, we done this one night as a cheaper night and maccies one night and decent food for the other 2 nights, you could spend an absolute fortune if you eat at the good places every night.You will obviously create your own itinerary when you get into the park, just make sure you grab a Park Map and show schedule from the main turnstile entrance at either park, you will need them. 4 days is enough time to do everything you want and some things twice if you want to, me and the boy went on the Tower of Terror ride 5 times, its brilliant (its the big Hollywood Hotel on the Studios park, prepare yourself!). Another tip would be to use the Fast pass ticket machines which you can have one of per park ticket per ride, you can be queuing for up to 45 mins for some rides but with the fast pass rides put your ticket in the machine and go back at the allotted time and the queues are tiny. Each night there is a fireworks display on the Main park at the big castle at 1900, it lasts for about half hour and we only went to it twice and it gets mega busy and it was a pain with the pushchair and the crowds, by the time you get out its about 2000 and then most people go and eat so restaurants are chocka, we ate before the fireworks as we had a little one who wanted her bed by this time, so it was back to the hotel for a beer.All in all a great holiday and we will be returning once the eldest is at least 1.4m tall as 2 of the rides he could not go on.",Disneyland_Paris
189428948,4,2013-3,United States,"Living in CA, we frequent Disneyland often. We've also been to Disneyworld in Florida. On our 2nd trip to Paris, we decided to take an excursion to Disneyland Paris. We went mid week March, and there were no lines at all. The most we waited was a 5 minute wait. We also saw characters everywhere. Most of the rides were open except Pirates of the Caribbean. It's smaller than Disneyland CA, but Disneyland Paris also has a charm on it's own. We enjoyed the train ride around the park and Space Mountain is different than the one in CA. The Peter Pan ride seems longer than the one in CA. The castle also has a different look than the one in Florida or CA. Like any Disney Parks even in Florida or California, you would appreciate the parks more if you go on non peak days. Disney Paris is the same. I didn't experience any rude tourist or rude staff members during our time there. The Plaza Gardens Restaurant on Main Street, which was a buffet serving international cuisine, the food there was delicious. Of course if you go during peak days like New Year's Eve or Christmas Day, you're going to always get frustrated people as there would be wall to wall people, and yes lines will be very long. But that's the same for any of the Disney parks around the world. They decorate the park for the holidays as early as November, go then before it gets crowded. Disney is always one of the best to provide entertainment , the look in your children's eyes just being amazed is just priceless and for adults it's always magical. If you can, stay at one of the Disney hotels, they allow an extra hour for hotel guests to visit the park before they open up to the public.",Disneyland_Paris
189408683,4,2014-1,United Kingdom,"Just returned from a 3 night 4 day break. We are 2 adults and 2 young teenage boys and stayed in the Sequoia Lodge.Firstly, we are big fans of Orlando attractions in Florida including Walt Disney World. Disneyland Paris (DLP) By no means compares to this but it does give you a blast of 'the magic'. Lots of things loved by us all in Orlando are there in DLP, including the Disney Village, it was lovely to go to Earl of Sandwich and see the Rainforest Cafe :) Since my last visit there, I felt that many of the Cast Members have improved and were far friendlier, talkative and happy! (Believe me this was not the case back in 2008 and 2010 on my previous visits. So this was a more magical in that respect as we could draw on the similarities, rather than lament over the differences.That is where the 'Magic' ends though really. There is two main things that puts a dampener on the experience for me: One is the sky high prices and the other is the smoking. There are some real 'ignorant' and obnoxious people who decide for themselves to flaunt the Disney rules of smoking in the designated area's and smoke where they like: in queues, watching parades, walking along and near eating area's. This was a major issue to me on every visit. I don't like passive smoking but find it even more offensive when I see children subjected to it and lets face it, this is a place for children and families! This does not happen in America! And if it does, there is usually a cast member around to confront this.All in all, would never go back for longer than 2 nights and 3 days as you can do it all in that time, would definitely pre book meals and even pay for the halfboard as its cheaper if you pre book, take lots of snacks etc with you from the UK and apart from the smoking would definitely go back again.",Disneyland_Paris

189387631,3,2013-12,United Kingdom,"My family and I went to Disney for New Year. From the moment we arrived at the park we realised we were not in for the magical time we had planned. Sadly this park does not follow the Walt Disney ethos and everything for the staff seemed too much trouble, there was no atmosphere and very little excitement for the staff, what there was were QUEUES! I understand we went on New Year but some rides had over 2 hour queues and fast track was to return 3 or 4 hours later. The rides did not have the same build up that we had experienced in Disney, Florida. The food was very expensive and even though we visited McDonalds's again we were disappointed after very long queues with little organisation, we found the food to be cold and the drinks we were given were not the full measure. In the park we saw only 2 Disney characters, there was no street entertainment and with little explanation paths would be closed and a crowd would form with little organisation from the marshalls. Sadly would say we will not be visiting this place anytime soon.",Disneyland_Paris
189383686,3,2013-12,United Kingdom,"There were parts of Disney that were truly magical. the castle, parades, some of the rides. everything is done on a big scale and the children loved meeting the characters (at a big cost). the workers there were lovely and helpful and they dress it all up for christmas is truly breath taking and makes it so magical. Now for the bad points. the queues for ALL the rides were over an hour long and like others have said smoking is permitted which was a big no no for us as non smokers which made queuing even more unbearable. we picked our spot for new years eve at 10.45 expecting to have some kind of build up however there was NONE. There was a ten second count down and then the dreams animation which we had arleady seen a couple of hours before, there was no extra fireworks and TBH it was a massive let down, especially when you could hear what sounded like amazing fireworks coming from the disney studios. however the worst was to come when we had to leave the park with the crowds especially paying for the car park. it was absolutly horrific, it was a free for all and every man out for themselves. tbh it spoilt the whole experience as it was actually quite scary.Lastly if you are planning food at disney you might want to take out a second mortgage. a basic burger dinner for a family of 4 will set you back 50 euros and if your planning on cafe mickey then expect to spend around 120 euros again for a family of 4.however even though there were quite a few flaws my boys had an amazing time but i don't think it would be somewhere we would return.",Disneyland_Paris

We visited two years ago in early January outside local school holidays and had the run of the park. Today we visited in school holidays and the park was so crowded. Get in early and try to do big ticket rides, otherwise expect 60 to 90 minute queues and up to 6 hours for fast pass on some rides. We spent over 300 Euro for a family of five to enter and got to experience an average of three rides each. Not a good day especially when you queue for ages for a big ticket ride and it breaks down.

Arrived at the parks just after they opened and had a great time although from 9pm until 12 midnight time dragged especially if you had been on all the rides. Downside side the food and drinks were expensive once you were in the park and in most cases when the food you had ordered arrived it was warm or in one instance not cook properly, the french are good at gourmet food but not very good at fast food. Being a disabled visitor the park was very good and by getting a disabled pass we were allowed to have access to the rides by using the exit, we are the people that are seen getting on the rides before any one else. there are also areas where the handicapped are allowed to watch the parades and the fireworks from. Disney has this off to fine art. Disappointed that the New Year firework show was not a different one as it was the same as the show shown earlier in the evening.",Disneyland_Paris

See laughed a lot and enjoyed the parade but....The park was really to busy, a lot of hassling around to get throughout the park. The wait times were to much, average waiting was around 50 75 minutes for an attraction which is simply to much. I do understand that it's difficult to manage but maybe some cleaver ones have ideas about how to improve this.The food is okay, but just okay :) For what you get you'll pay too much! I think Disney could get this better on track. When at Disney Florida the food is much better. Yes, two tracks were closed and people were very frustrated about it, but it's for our own safety of course. Bottom Line, it's a nice park, looks great can be really busy and yes the food should be better but you're kids they love it probably : 0PS: We have payed 71 euro a person which is really much.

I and my family went to disneyland Paris for Christmas and I have to says I and my family were disappointed we bought our tickets on line and never got to use any of the amusements with all the queues we had a two and a half year old with us and its not possible to expect a child of that age to stand in queues for 40, 60, or 90 minutes . Its very badly organised It also appeared that if you new the people who were operating the rides it was possible to skip the queues as we noticed a no. of people who just walked in and got on the rides without having to queue .I would also say that the exorbitant prices charged for daily passes is a complete waste of money as prepaying for the use of the rides does not allow you any quicker access to the rides",Disneyland_Paris

For instance, the Indiana Jones ride was simply a carnival roller coaster built around an aging, molding temple badly in need of a cleaning. People smoked everywhere, which made standing in line a whole different experience. There was mold on the park signs, too, which I   m sure would have horrified Walt. Not good.

The wait times were crazy...even for the toddler rides. And people are allowed TO SMOKE. In the queues and generally about the place. It's absolutely revolting and frankly I don't think it's acceptable.The Disney characters were few and far between....Mickey Mouse was commanding a 45 minute wait and you couldn't take the buggy in....so that was out.The food is blistering expensive and mediocre...the staff are nice enough but have absolutely no sense of urgency to get people fed and the queues down. So you wait some more...and some more. Maybe my expectations were too high but I just found it very stressful dealing with the crowds and not being able to find anything to do that didn't require queuing....or buying Disney merchandise.Oh and if you come in December do bring a hat.

The former focuses on atmosphere and action, the latter on shows and the art of movie making. During winter time there are no crowds but several attractions are closed.Positive :Disneyland Park is clean, safe and well organized.The staff are competent and friendly and spare no effort to offer you a good time.The park is visually impressive and very atmospheric. We very much enjoyed the lighting of the christmas tree. The closing show at the castle included beautiful light effects and projections, water sprouts and fireworks.Obviously most attractions are oriented towards families with kids but there are also four thrill rides for adults.There are lots of photo opportunities throughout the park as well as meet and greets with Disney characters.Negative :Disneyland Park is hypercommercial. There are more shops and restaurants than attractions. Prices of food and merchandise are double in average.Shows and animation are very American, i.e. bombastic, with excessive enthusiasm and emotion. The parades are a kitsch fest.In conclusion :Disneyland Park is only a must for true Disney fans because it offers the same attractions and thrill rides as any other theme park and solely diehards will find the link with the various Disney characters sufficient justification for the much higher entrance fee.",Disneyland_Paris

My son is lactose intolerant and they finally agreed to give me a chicken sandwich with no cheese...it had cheese!We then tried getting onto Armageddon, Tower of Terror and two other rides, which all experienced  technical experiences !!

Food is expensive we added half board to our package which we were pleased with we had a lovely meal in Walts restaurant , there are lots of places to eat if you go be prepared to pay more for your food all theam parks charge a lot for food. I will definitely be returning in a few years but would try to avoid the weekends .",Disneyland_Paris
188813829,1,2013-12,Spain,"For the price you pay to be shoved around by unfriendly staff, queue for hours for every single ride and for any food item which then is of the poorest quality imaginable and incredibly overpriced is totally outrageous. Customer experience and service obviously means nothing to Disney! We were Ina. Restaurant and had to queue for hours, then as soon as queues got shorter they started closing tills so that the remaining ones had equally long queues. On our first day we managed a. Total of 4 rides because every one had between 70 and 90 minutes wait! It was an incredibly disappointing experience and we will surely never come back.",Disneyland_Paris
188760405,1,2013-11,United Kingdom,"Disney is supposed to make your dreams come true. Sadly the magic disappeared on day one when we arrived. The accommodation was fine, beds nice and comfy, a good size and clean. No kettle or drink making facilities in the room. We had to hire a kettle    25, which came with nothing !! Oh of course you have to buy a tea package to go with it.    9, what does that have in it? Four paper cups, PAPER CUPS ! Four tea bags, UHT milk in pots.Sugar and four biscuits. No thanks . Bought cups from store and got t bags from restaurants. Needed a wheelchair, no mobility scooters! Okay, you need to walk to the park for 20 mins which is quicker or catch the bus. Done ! In park you have hire scrappy wheelchair which didn't open properly or steer well.    125:00 deposit and    45 a day as well as the evening before use and morning of return even when we were not in the park.    90 to have it sitting in the corridor. The hotel would not return it for us. Bad organisation skills came to mind.....No facilites for a quick meal for the kids. Restaurant     27 per head all you eat buffett. No good for kids and diabetics on portion control. Bar snacks   all we offer is a slice of pizza and a pot of pasta heated in the microwave. So five portions and drinks   54 : (Breakfast buffet. Nothing for diabetics at all. Sugar cereals, fruit in syrup, white bread, cheeses, croissants......oh dear!On site queues everywhere. Expensive food and poor quality. Broken rides, rides closed and kids cold and disappointed. We had to queue to see Mickey, Whinnie the pooh and no other characters around. Very saddened by this. The best bits........ rides that were open, the parade was frequent and really exciting, Christmas lights everywhere made it look so magical, fireworks were heavenly but on too late so my children missed them. The best thing of all was the Character breakfast, it made their trip. Lots of food and lots of characters to visit them.",Disneyland_Paris
188758218,5,2013-11,United Kingdom,We visited the park after a trip to Paris and we both had a great time. As we visited after 11 November the Disney Christmas experience was in full swing and I loved it. I have been known to be a bit cynical about Christmas but this was truly magical. Disney Dreams of Christmas is something everyone needs to see and the Christmas cavalcade was great too. The 'cast' members are all extremely helpful and the many characters you encounter could not have been more friendly and are excellent at staying in character. There are really rides for everyone of all bravery levels and there is even a stunt show for the car freaks. The queues were almost non existent at this time of year and there was hardly any waiting especially compared to Disneyland California. It was cold and the weather did take a turn for the worse a few times so wrap up warmly and buy a poncho from one of the shops and you'll be fine! There are plenty of good places to get food and there is also a shop in easy walking distance at the station so you can get anything you need (Including beer : P).,Disneyland_Paris
188747107,4,2013-12,United Kingdom,"This is the busier of the two parks, so get in early and use the Fast Pass system as best you can. When we were there over the XMas period it was extremely busy   if like us you can get an Access Pass then use the guest services over in the other park as the queues to get to Guest Services in Disneyland Park are enormous (will be your longest queue of the day!!). Most popular ride and longest queue was Buzz Lightyear and then Space Mountain, get your Fast Pass for one of these early on. Like previous reviewers have mentioned and anyone who has been or going to Disney should know, it does get very busy particularly at peak times, food and merchandise is very pricey and usually not of great quality, but you just have to go along with the flow   you are on holiday after all!",Disneyland_Paris
188721327,3,2013-12,United Kingdom,"I really wish I could write a magical review but sadly that's not the case. Myself, misses and our 2yr old went for a weekend trip to gently break little Eliie into the Disney bubble, before heading across the pond to the USA. Both myself and wife had been before many yrs ago separately and sort of knew what we had in store, as we have also been to the USA versions. It was a Christmas spectacle weekend but sadly they forgot to send that memo to all the staff and park designers, with just the first arch and Main Street decorated and no sound of any Xmas music to be heard, in fact there was no music to be heard anywhere!!!! Not even the constant loop of  SMALL WORLD . The park was packed with visitors but not a Disney caractor in sight!! Except for designated times in designated areas with a now got use to 2hr Queue, the only way we felt we could get to meet them was to book a breakfast meet and greet... Which brings me nicely to food... OUCHHHHHHH super expensive and at best just ok, snack wise McDonalds was a big mistake, over populated, rude shatter staff, no order, no seats, when you finally did find somewhere to sit, other customers would try to nearly sit on your lap or push you along your table to make space for them!!!! If you did get what you ordered you were lucky and if not the thought of fighting your way back to the counter would bring you out in a cold sweat. Most of the park restaurants where closed, and the ones that weren't were v expensive (   30 per head) packed or very child UN friendly. As a family with a child it seemed strangely unwelcoming and we felt our only option was to wonder around all day every day, as you couldn't get onto the rides without an  hr wait, and without the buggy (as there not to be taken past ride gates) and either a shattered or active toddler is not fun.. The one saving grace is the dream castle show and fireworks which is stunning.. But why ohh why do it at 22:00???? Leaving literally thousands off ppl all leaving at the same time racing for the busses. It could easily be done at 8 or 9 for the same effect and allow ppl time to wonder more and slowly make there way home. Also again most kids are by now shattered or asleep and miss it all. I really don't want to put a downer on it the park as other family's with older kids may have a blast but I do believe it's lost its sparkle and get the feeling that most staff hope it's there last day. So   very expensive, over priced poor relation to the USA parks where I get the feeling that even Disney have given up on the park... Sorry",Disneyland_Paris
188511737,4,2013-10,Netherlands,"A trip to Disneyland hurts in the wallet, but everybody has a good time. So crowded and long lines to the rides, if they are still running. Food is expensive and quality is not a star worth. Gadgets, all with Disney brand, also for sale at high prices.Of course, the park is still wonderfull after many years, amazing and so cool for kids and who else loves Disney. The rides are just another ride, but the ambiance makes it special. Everybody has said positive things, but I just want to point to some specific awakenings.Something new is the so called  fast pass . Completely unnecessary. The price is the same as a ticket to the park, so doubled to have saved 15 minutes and annoy others who are just logically waiting in line.Suprisingly many parents with kids so young, they cannot enter anywhere. Why do they have to be in the park and annoy others? For themself? Wait just a few years, save money, come back and enjoy. Maybe they are French and have a season pass? Sono Pazzi Questi Gallico (Ils sont fous, ces Fran  ais)...",Disneyland_Paris
188490198,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,Disney is a magical place for kids. Disney Dreams for Christmas show is breathtaking it lifts your spirits and makes you believe in all things good and wonderful. Fast pass does help you cover a bit more on the rides. Vegetarians have limited food options. Recommend to carry or rent stroller or the kids will wear out.,Disneyland_Paris
188355651,5,2013-1,Netherlands,"I strongly recommend the seasonal ticket!! Living in Paris it was just great to go a seen that one show or event.... true it  s fun to walk around the whole day as well, but if have a chance to visit the park at more quite moments, weekdays, evenings   you do have a lot more fun :) Not to mention that the seasonal pass works as a fast ticket!!",Disneyland_Paris
188332139,3,2013-12,Australia,"On my quest to visit all Disney parks, this is my second last (just Florida left, then Shanghai when it opens) and so far the one I liked the least.OK, it's Disney, so the crowds are there and you queue for EVERYTHING. Deal with it or don't go. To my surprise though, even a cold wet day in late December didn't keep the numbers down. But as I said, it's to be expected.I was expecting a much larger park, yes it's big but somehow it didn't seem to have as much in it. No splash mountain which was disappointing, but Space Mountain was the best one of all.The food options were quite good, not just cruddy burgers and fries and the kids seemed to eat less junk (which is very relative) than other parks, but then again, many outside concessions were closed due to weather.I guess my biggest irritant was the excessive amount of smokers everywhere. I watched many kids with their smoking parents sucking in second hand smoke which was very sad. My lungs were sore at points   queuers seem to think they can just light up and pollute everyone. So disgusting.The Disney parade (even in the rain) was a lot of fun, as they all are, but being Christmas, it was fun to have a Santa theme going on.",Disneyland_Paris
188321032,2,2013-12,United States,"I used to live in Florida, and and had an annual pass for several years to the Walt Disney World resort and loved it. I've also been to Disneyland California several times, and overall really enjoy the Disney experience. But now living in Paris and having visiting Disneyland Paris twice, I unfortunately have to say that Disneyland Paris is a pale imitation of the  real  Disney experience. The parks are far smaller, the decorations (we went at Halloween and Christmas) are FAR less impressive, the employees are less friendly, the bathrooms are much more disgusting, the park dirtier, the food is even more overpriced and FAR worse, and it just doesn't feel near as magical or fun. The general visitor population is much ruder, and I swear the park is about half as lit so you can't see where you're going. It doesn't help that most people ignore the no smoking regulations and you even have people chain smoking while waiting in lines and for parades next to you. There are some benefits to visiting though for the die hard Disney amusement park fans since many of the rides are quite different (Space Mountain and India Jones are incredibly different and much more exciting) and the Haunted Mansion is far more creepier than the US versions. And we didn't hate our time there (hence the two circles instead of one). But unless you're a hardcore Disney nut, it's really not worth the cost to go out there and pay for a very substandard Disney experience. I guess if you're only other option was paying for a trans atlantic flight it might be worth going to Disneyland Paris, but really, save your money and go to Orlando. It really is much better (just don't go during summer, it's miserably hot).",Disneyland_Paris
188314842,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"Went with a 6 year old as a Christmas Treat, and we weren't disappointed. The theming, Christmas parade, Tree Lighting ceremony and Disney Dreams show were all amazing. We were there mid week in early December and the park was very quiet, hardly any queues, and a very pleasant experience. The Saturday we left was already packed with people! We found the park clean, well run, lots and lots of friendly staff, and full of Christmas cheer.It is cold, but clear bright days helped, and not having to queue for long meant we didn't suffer. A nice touch is the free hot drink voucher you get for the afternoon if you buy a drink in the morning in certain cafes.We stayed in the Sequoia Lodge which is prefect for Christmas with big log fires and a cosy woodland theme. We had a room on the new Golden Forest floor, newly refurbished and nicely decorated with a Bambi theme.The benefits of the Golden Forest room include : A fridge,An iron and ironing boardA nespresso machineA kettle and tea making thingsA TV with some disney channels ( we didn't actually use it)Two double beds ( small doubles )A bath with an over showerA safeA hairdryerThere is also a separate area for Golden Forest rooms to have breakfast, which means there isn't the usual morning scrum. It was a very pleasant start to the day, Disney characters visited every morning, there was a calm clean environment and a large breakfast choice, usual continental sort of things, croissants, rolls, toast, fresh fruit, yoghurts, cold meats and cheese, jams and honey etc. All buffet service and help yourself to as much as you like.You also get  afternoon tea , from 4pm   6pm, cakes such as brownies, almond sponge, caramel doughnuts, lemon cakes and sweets, with hot and cold drinks served in the Golden Forest lounge. This is worth doing especially before the Disney Dreams which is at 7pm as the park closes.We ate a couple of nights in the Hunters Grill, a buffet style restaurant in the hotel. It isn't cheap but the food is top quality and a large selection of dishes, and a great dessert selection if you remember to leave room. A very nice end to the day.We can also recommend the Silver Spur for a burger at lunchtime, and the Main street sandwich bars such as Cable Car cafe. Lots of the restaurants aren't open during the quieter weekdays so watch out.The longest queue was to meet Santa Claus, and it was quite a disappointing experience. The theming was nice but the queue was far longer (over an hour) than the themeing could hold interest for. Santa was very genuine and chatted nicely with the kids, but there was no gift just a couple of photo cards to go an buy pictures later. Lots of  priority  people got to jump the queue which made things slow and not much fun for those with young children.We spent a day and a half in Disneyland park, and a day and a half in Walt Disney studios. Our son loves all the big rides and there was plenty to do and still enjoy the disneyness. The Back lot tour has been downgraded from when we first went seven years ago and was disappointing. The Moteurs Action stunt show has also been downgraded and is hardly worth going to now. We remember jetski's, fire, jumping carsa nd lots of races but thats all gone. The Lightening McQueen bits are fun for the kids but they seem so scared of denting the car that there are no real stunts.Overall a fabulous trip, hard not to be swept away by the Disney magic even for hardened grown ups and all children will love it ! With a bit of planning to avoid very overpriced food, getting over tired and cold, and making the most of the  extra hours  and Fastpasses that come with staying in a DIsney hotel, it can be a stressless and wonderful trip",Disneyland_Paris

188308958,2,2013-12,United Arab Emirates,"Great rides   kids had a great time. Dirty, lots of litter and chewing gum etc. Toilets filthy and massively overprice food.

188301774,3,2013-12,United States,"The press are stating the park looks rundown. That isn't really the problem imo.  Fewer people are spending on meals and in the shops so the park makes its money by letting way too many through the turn styles. You could barely move on main street, it was pointless waiting in a good spot for Dreams & the parades as people just barge you out of the way once it started. It was only thanks to EMH that we got on some of the rides. The only meet and greets in this park were in roped off area's or via meals. We didn't mind as we stayed in HNY so saw characters there but would have been annoyed to have queued for the princesses or paid to meet them over dinner only to find them out and walking round in the studios. We also saw pick pockets operating in the queue for BTM on the weekend. Christmas dreams is amazing and some of the shops have lovely things but the park needs a good re think or less people so everyone can get on the rides.",Disneyland_Paris
188290826,3,2013-12,United Kingdom,"This was our fourth visit to the park so perhaps the magic is wearing off a bit. We stayed at the park from Wednesday to Friday. I know that the park has financial difficulties and it's obvious that cut backs have been made. Sadly the snow machine in Main Street now does not seem to operate, this added a little bit of magic I always thought. Also, there is no longer a Christmas Parade in the evening. There is an excellent light laser firework display centred on the castle but we still missed the parade and the catchy music  incidentally this is at 7pm not 10pm as somebody has claimed . We had hoped to eat at the Blue Lagoon restaurant and although this was listed as one of the restaurants open it was in fact closed for the duration of our stay. Also, disappointed to find that Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show is closed on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays! In addition to the Blue Lagoon restaurant being closed, so were many others. There is virtually nothing between really expensive restaurants and fast food burger outlets  which all serve exactly the same limited choice of food  except for the odd pizza place. Some of the rides including Pirates of the Caribbean broke down while we were there and had to close. I was very surprised at the state of some of the toilets. I had to take my grandson to the mens toilet and found them to be in a disgusting state, and this was before 10am when the park opens  we had early access passes . I found other toilets to be out of order or broken, a sure sign of monetary problems I think. These are all the negatives that I have noticed compared to previous years  and my last visit was 7 years ago  but if this is your first visit to the park I'm sure that you will still find it magical as did one of our party who hadn't been before. And the kids of all ages will love it   apart from the boring queues of course!",Disneyland_Paris
188154362,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,Fireworks show on at silly o' clock. (10pm). Its the middle winter & the place has been dark for 5 hours. It was freezing. Take blankets as sitting around can get cold. The queues don't diminish during the colder weather also. : (,Disneyland_Paris
188134154,5,2013-12,Malaysia,"Its a must visit to Disneyland Park if you plan to visit Paris especially if you are traveling with children. My advise is to visit at least for 2 days with ticket allowing you to go to both disneyland park and disney studio. Choose weekdays to visit to avoid large crowds and long queue to enjoy the rides. Spend ,ore hours at the disney park as it has more attractions. Don't waste your time traveling from central Paris, there are many affordable hotels nearby with free shuttle transfer to and fro the hotels.",Disneyland_Paris

We became kids and tried most of the tours in the park. There is fast track ticket and there are specific timing for a trip. so you can choose a normal line or a fast track line with a timing. Plan accordingly and you can do most of the trips. the ultimate experience was the Disney projector show which starts after dark till upto almost 12pm at the night. Trust me you do not want to miss the projector show!!!,Disneyland_Paris
188031428,4,2013-12,United States,"Just back from Disney, a very magical experience. I would strongly reccomend going at Christmas, this was my 3rd visit and it was out of this world with all the parades, displays and so Christmassy !Stayed at Hotel Santa Fe, good hotel basic but you are only there to sleep for a few hours, very clean rooms. Very exspensive on the parks so would advice anyone to take drinks and snacks with them.Be prepared to wait up to 90 minutes for rides.Be prepared at all times to have every receipt on you for anything you have purchased as Security grabbed us one evening as leaving Disney village accusing us of stealing a large Minnie Mouse ( which my 3 year old grandaughter was holding ) we had purchased this the previous day ! security demanded we showed them receipt and were made to feel like criminals. So be very careful when purchassing any Disney products and letting children hold them ect in pushchairs as you will be accused of shoplifting. Keep all receipts on you at all times regardless !

188014478,1,2013-12,Australia,"I took my daughter here from Australia on the 4th of December 2013 after a very difficult year for her. It should have been an amazing time for her, but was most dissapointing. I took my son 15 years ago at the same time of the year and it was fabulous then. It is very dated and in need of a paint job and facelift. There were no great new rides or anyhthing fresh.So many things were closed and the only thing new was the Princess parlour which was all my daughter talked about doing and it was CLOSED. A lot of the food stalls were closed but of course all of the souvenir shops were open. The only other thing my daughter wanted other than the Princess makeover was an ice cream and as crazy as that is to want in December, thats what she wanted. The kiosks that sold icecream were either closed or had none left. We saw a 10 15 minute Xmas parade with the Characters and other than that we did not see another Character the whole day. Imagine going to Disneyland and not passing a Character after doing the whole park!This was a most dissapointing trip. If they are going to close down a lot due to Winter they should atleast warn you at the gates or discount the ticket.",Disneyland_Paris

187996120,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"Absolutely magical. All the people complaining about the queues, what do you expect? It's a very popular theme park, did you expect them to roll out the red carpet for you? Yes the queues can be bad but all you have to do is plan ahead with fast pass tickets etc. Food isn't great but you don't go there for the food.... I have multiple allergies and was fine, again, just plan ahead by looking online what is available before you go. Huge amount of toilets (with no queues!) which is something you don't often get in theme parks. Honestly some of the people on here complain about some very trivial things, you can't please everyone. For an extremely busy theme park which is open almost every day of the year the staff do their absolute best. Can't wait to return next year!!",Disneyland_Paris

I've listed them below with my responsea) Don't buy tickets at the gate   One day, two park will set you back 81 Euros (Student 48 Euros). Instead go to the round information booth outside the train station and get your ticket for 39 Euros. By doing this, you will skip the ticket lines at Disneylandb) The rides are for kids   In Disneyland a lot of the rides are suited more for kids but there are some rides that are great for teens adults. Walt Disney Studios have plenty for the older. c) The lines are long   The longest line we had was 20 minutes. Be smart, avoid weekends and make a plan for the  Must Do  rides and do them straight away. The park is lovely and the parade was very enjoyable.

187681097,4,2013-10,United Kingdom,"My 6 year old son loved it here, enjoyed the streets and buildings, however you couldn't get anything proper to eat and it was so crowded, long queues for rides, long queues for food, we survived on snacks Ide brought from home for our lunch, plus some bread from breakfast. Too many shops, most items over priced. The tills are festooned with sweets and the doorways are crowded with small things that kids want to pick up! This parental unfriendly layout is in all of the shops, one wonders if this is deliberate? Unsuprisingly the shops are not too crowded, but if you want to go on a ride or visit an attraction or have a meal beware! My advice is to take your own food and queue for the rides. There are a FEW stalls selling candy floss, marshmallows, Disney's own sweets and coke but NO sandwiches, no hot snacks, no proper juices, and alack a day no proper chocolate to be found anywhere!",Disneyland_Paris
187679187,3,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Shame about the badly managed queues and lack of food. Luckily other travellers warn of this so we took food with us for lunch, but nothing can prepare you for the long dismal queues, all without seating, some without shelter, 1 was underground where people were coughing and pushing together in dark dusty tunnels leading to Jake & Neverland Pirates underground boat ride, the boats were so dangerous and could be slower, no safety barriers on sides   quite dangerous. My 6 year old son Heny was jiggling up and down with excitement oblivious to danger and I kept a tight grip on him else he'd be overboard! sadly the very next day on this ride a little boy fell off and was crushed by the mechanised boats, horrific. Yes its fun for kids here and I also enjoyed it, but the health & safety issues on some rides are glaringly obvious and its shocking that no one seems to care! There are huge queues for all food outlets and its almost impossible to get a meal without a very long wait, thus eating up your time queuing for rides! We decided to queue for rides and ate our snacks from home on the hoof! Even getting a seat on a bench is difficult here as all packed, most people sat on the stone walls! We were hungry all the time and it felt like we were on a bush tucker trial! Luckily little Henry was so excited by being in Disneyland that he didn't seem to mind a snack for his lunch. I must complain about the shops as there are too many little distracting things near the doors for little children to try to grab, also around the tills are lots of sweets   wonder why this is? surely not deliberate??? There are little stalls selling candy floss, Disney's own brand sweets and cokes, but no sandwiches, no hot snacks, no proper chocolate. My advice is to take your own snacks for lunch with you from home unless your want to starve or queue for a long time. Lots of pretty flowers and some lovely Disney parades which my son was enthralled by. We loved wandering in the magic castle and the streets are real old time, great. However there is a lack of toilets, lack of proper signposting and the staff cant give proper directions as the ones we asked didn't speak English. But with my poor French and their poor English we got by. For the amount of people here in this very expensive resort you'd never guess there's a recession! My little son wants to go back, but I cant face the queues and worry about lack of proper food available for him. Would have been great if there was some little cafe's available to sit down and have a snack but no! Tried to get an ice cream and the queue was half way down main street! ridiculous and very badly managed.",Disneyland_Paris

We both enjoyed it but if you have been to the US versions you may find these parks disappointing as they're a lot smaller with less rides and quite a few of the attractions and restaurants in both parks were closed. We were very very lucky with the weather as although it was super cold it was dry and the sun shone every day. The christmas lights were stunning and we really enjoyed the dancing fountains, lights and firework show at closing time. One thing I really didn't like is the fact that smoking is permitted in the parks but that's just me! As it was only a short break we found enough to do for the couple of days we were there but I think any longer and we would have been bored. We also went to see the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show which was ok if you can get discounted tickets. All in all it was an enjoyable stay but would I go again to the Paris resort? Probably not!",Disneyland_Paris
187535236,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I started the year as a Disneyland Paris sceptic, doubting it would be able to live up to it's Florida and California sister parks being in Europe. How wrong I was!These parks are every bit as Disney as the ones in America, and in fact being set in France I think gives them a very nice European feel. The staff are warm, friendly & helpful & the parks are clean and well kept. The gift shops are expensive but there is a good choice of merchandise on offer. There is a large variety of good quality restaurants in the hotels & in the parks.I have actually visited Disneyland Paris twice this year (April & August), having booked to go again as soon as I got home!",Disneyland_Paris
187531284,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,"Been to Florida, California and Paris numerous times. Having just returned again and enjoyed the Christmas activities I now think this is my favourite individual Disney park of all. It is absolutely stunning!The Christmas cavalcade is beautiful and full of Christmas cheer. The Xmas Dreams over the castle is also stunning. Individual rides and attractions are really good. The Buzz Lightyear attraction is great. Pirates of the Caribbean is great (though Jack Sparrow is nowhere to be seen). Big Thunder Mountain, WOW. Any Disney fan from Europe who hasn't been here is missing out and should do so ASAP.We will be back!",Disneyland_Paris

187475733,3,2013-12,United Kingdom,"I visited with my partner, my daughter and two grandchildren. We spent three days here, and although theme parks aren't my 'thing', the Christmasy feel was unbelievable. My grandson was enthralled by it all, and it was wonderful to see his face.However, I had no idea that I should have remortgaged! I know it was Disneyland, but it really is ONLY Disneyland   the shops sell only Disney related products, be they    26 pyjamas,    16 mugs, right down to bags of Haribo sweets......... yep, with the Disneyland logo on them.Food   no wonder I saw people making picnic rolls at breakfast in the hotel and stuffing them into their bags   lunch came to a minimum of    30 a day, and our evening meals (a very basic main course and one drink x three) totalled    90      100 euros a day.All I will say is, enjoy it, but beware that you will need to take plenty of spending money, even though all the rides etc are free.",Disneyland_Paris
187443369,3,2013-10,El Salvador,My daughter really wanted to go here to my dismay. The tickets were very easy to get online. Taking the train is very easy though I highly recommend to buy a round trip ticket on departure. The RER station is very understaffed and with only two automated machines for such a a busy place it is outrageous. The parks were Disney what you would expect. My girl was happy. I suggest to bring snacks as the food lines are long to get expensive grease.,Disneyland_Paris

The transfers both to and from the airport were excellent. The drivers were both very pleasant, friendly and helpful. On the return journey the driver even called me well in advance to say he would be 10 minutes late and to check if that was ok. The vehicle was very comfortable and the price for four people was very good. We were in our hotel in Disneyland within 40 minutes of leaving the airport with no hassle of looking for buses, trains, etc.",Disneyland_Paris

187348231,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"growing up i always wanted to go to disney but it was a luxury we could not afford, but then as years went by that urge was always there so at the spare of a moment we booked to go.it is everything i thought it would be, the moment you arrive and walk to the ticket turnstalls and enter the park. the whole feeling with the decoration and back ground music makes the illustion even more true! i felt like a kid at christmas again. the moment you see the disney castle you know all your dreams have come true!, the 2 parcs them self are i feel age designed. disney for the younger and disney studios for the older. we did 3 days both parks and had the time of our lives. i would recommended it to anyone of all ages!we took the full pension option were we got breakfast lunch and dinner i would recommended that as eating in the park is expensive and it all adds up. this way it is all paid for and done.",Disneyland_Paris
187336085,1,2013-12,Brunei,"Husband and I visited Paris Disneyland on a thursday with high expectations. The queue to get in is very short so we were in the park 10 minutes later. As soon as we got in I notice the place is so glum and not well maintained. I visited HK Disneyland in 2008 and it was much better. We have not had our breakfast when we went to Disneyland because we planned to have it in the park. Guess what?? No restaurants or stalls are open at 10am and I was starving and did not enjoy the first two hours in the park. At 12pm we queued up for lunch in a restaurant and the buffet is extortious,    27 per person!! Being a vegetarian i did not have much choice of food in the restaurant. On top of that the place they seated us had a strong smell from the toilet. This experience really dampen our experience.Most of the rides were the same with HK Disneyland. The one i particularly enjoy which i missed in hk is Teacup ride. December is the worse time to visit this park due to : they close early at 6 pm, lots of rides are closed for maintenance and it is too cold being outside!!!Main element that i missed in Paris Disneyland are the jinggles in the metro train ride approaching the park. It really does give me the 'feel' of Disneyland.",Disneyland_Paris
187179886,5,2013-11,Sweden,"Nowadays being a trifle handicapped, we had to meet our grandchildren where we thought it was possible, where you could use a wheelchair. I was surprised ! The whole parc was suited for people with disabilities, we even had favors while waiting in ques. OK it is 20 years old and could use a little paint but this did not matter. Staff was very becoming. Restaurants were always funny and had exciting food. Attractions were brilliant, even for elderly In conclusion: definitely a place to visit with or without children or grandchildren. Stay there for at least 4 days !!",Disneyland_Paris
187173735,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,We had been to both Disneyland and Disneyworld in USA and so wanted to see if the Paris one was as good. We were delighted to see that the layout and Disney style is just the same. We had never been at Christmas time before and the tree and lights decorations were spectacular. Getting there by train was so easy and within minutes you are in the park from the train station. Bought tickets online from a company that boasts they are the cheapest for tickets and they were not wrong!,Disneyland_Paris
187140524,5,2013-6,New Zealand,"Touring around with my friend in Europe visiting The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, Italy and France, her wish was to go to Disney Land. So we did. The weather was really bad that day but it did not take away our great time. We were first in line, lol, we thoroughly enjoyed it. We bought a twin ticket for the universal studios. Even though we didn't spent much time in there it was just great to be there and perfect to end our day in Paris",Disneyland_Paris

They do speak english but i gathered they appreciated it when you attempted to speak french to them.The food is affordable and the souvenirs are plentiful and great quality.Unknowingly, i went during school holidays so it was packed with kiddie winkles :S They can be pretty abrupt and tend to push in. If your a disney fan or grew up with disney, its still worth the visit.",Disneyland_Paris
187093563,3,2013-11,United Kingdom,"The park was a bit tired and needs updating, saying that we did enjoy our two days would definitely recommend travelling off season as the longest we had to wait for a ride was 20mins. Albeit we did wait 1 hour in the cold to see Santa can't say it was amazing I think Disney could do a lot better and made it more of an experience   I have been to Santa trials at home which were better. Parade was very good nice touch adding fake snow kids really enjoyed it.",Disneyland_Paris
187028427,3,2013-12,United Kingdom,"Got on an RER train from Paris and was an easy ride. Took only an hour and the train ticket price wasn't that bad. (7.50 euros one way).Got there at around 10.30am. There already was a good crowd.There were lots of rides and it only took an average of 10 15 mins wait. Not enough rides though, in my opinion.I went with my partner and a 2 year old. There was nothing much interesting for my Disney Cars fan 2 year old son. The closest was Autopia (which we enjoyed). We didn't realise that Cars was in the other park. It was too late, we were already in Disneyland Park.We got on a few rides and looked around. We enjoyed the train that went around the park. We spent most of our time in Adventureland as it was better for boys. We had lunch there and it was so expensive.The projector screen in the lunch area was terrible. Our tv was a lot better quality than that. You wouldn't expect less from Disney! The short clips were entertaining but the screen quality was crap. The Nescafe vending machines were also horrible. 3 euros for a teeny tiny cup. One out of the two machines was broken. The toilets were horrible. It was as if nobody bothered to clean it. The mirrors were disgusting, they looked like they haven't been cleaned since the park opened. The toilets were smelly. The hand driers were dirty. And none of them were themed.There weren't enough customer service attendants either. It wasn't easy looking for someone for directions. There weren't enough signs to tell you where to go (directions to toilets and different areas of the park). The worst part is that we didn't see a single character mascot. Oh, we did. Belle. At 10.30am with the security guard going to her post. Looked like she just woke up. And also, when we left the park, we went to the restaurant areas and found the Mickey Cafe way at the end of the walk, and there were Pluto, Goofy and Hook inside. That was it.The grand finale was great but not as great as Florida. Paris' finale was all just projection based. (Impressive projector though). No actual characters singing and dancing live. Although there were great water  and fireworks.The park was packed but it was not too bad. It was bearable. (Apart from the rude Parisiens).There were also more Disney stores than rides. The prices of items were double that of Disney Stores in London! What a scam.My son was bored most of the time. We weren't really impressed. Although we could say that we had a good day overall. I wouldn't really go back again. But it's good to experience it at least once.",Disneyland_Paris

187007459,5,2013-12,United Kingdom,It's not the large park to match Orlando but none the less it's a good day or two out. This is our second visit and we enjoyed again. We visited orlando as we'll this year and yes this park I lacking in attractions and shows but is non the less worth a visit. It's good value when booked as a package with a disney hotel especially if you have children under 7. Would visit again.,Disneyland_Paris
186997418,3,2013-11,United Kingdom,"In short a very expensive way to waste money. Ok it's primarily for kids but some rides were 70% adults hence the queues with an average 45 minute wait. End of November and the place was packed so I dread to think what the summer holidays are like. We did a 1 day  sampler  and I can see why they say you need at least two days to see it all, what they really mean is in an 8 hour day you spend at least half the time queuing thus sampling only 4 5 rides. The car coach park is a long walk from the parks, what about courtesy electric buggies for the disabled? At 15 euros for cars and 20 for coaches I'm sure they can afford it! 40 euro adult entry, 36 euro for kids you can just about stomach but to be fleeced on everything else is taking the  mickey  ( pardon the pun )! Food and drink was extortionate, 10 euros for a  deluxe  8 inch hotdog in a pappy roll with no mustard or onions, and 10 euros for for a coke and coffee because when you ask for a straw they  sell  you a Carlos Fandango Disney one. At one kiosk they wouldn't honour the 8.95 euro offer despite protestations, was it simply because we were English? Shopping for clothing ( All made in China ) at Harrods prices, 22 euros for a sparkly kiddies T shirt, or nick knacks also drained the pocket. In places a lick of paint wouldn't go amiss as it's beginning to look a bit tired especially the Hollywood hotel who's neon sign needs looking at! The only characters we saw in the park were Poo Bear and a tiger who's name escapes me, Disney was built on Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Daisy and Goofy but they were conspicuous by their absense only to be seen at the highlight of the day, the parade. Here perhaps I can see where some of our money went, the floats were superb in all respects and for me the lasting memory, after my empty pockets, of a day I will NOT be repeating anytime soon.",Disneyland_Paris

186897705,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Out of all the Disneylands in the world, this one is most efficient, which is a suprise since it is in france. Go during the week and DO NOT GO on school break unless you like waiting. Use the Vip lines, go there get a ticket and come back 2 hours later to minimise the waiting. Food is good quality but expensive as you can imagine. The railroad is by far the best ride for thrills. Explore the Island in the middle and get a picture at the top. Yelling  andys coming  no longer drops the characters to the ground, that was a cool trick, especially when they were in parade. The lilo and stitch interactive show is quite a cool thing to see!Getting here is a trek for paris, but do catch the special disneyland train, its an experience and will warm you up for what is a brainwashing cultish experience which adults can reminisce and kids will love",Disneyland_Paris

186819901,5,2013-5,India,"Everybody knows Disneyland is a wonderful place for kids. I will tell you how to enjoy more and get the most out of your trip to Disney. I am writing about the Disneyland in Paris also called Euro Disney. If you are a first time visitor go the Disney Park, instead of Disney studio, you would definetely enjoy more. Disney would be less fun, if you do not have a kid with you. Your fun would be maximised on seeing the expressions on the face of the kid who could see all his her fairy tales come alive. Disney makes you walk a lot, so have a good sleep on the previous day and have a good breakfast for you and the kid(s). Do not try to finish the rides hastily. Do it patiently, believe me, there would be enough time in the day to complete rides to your satisfaction. Do not miss the last parade at 8 pm. If you miss the parade you have not seen what Disney is all about. Have a happy trip !",Disneyland_Paris

It's a Small World might actually be the same. The Thunder Railroad goes forwards, backwards and has loops. It's so much fun! The food is good and the atmosphere was Disney like with friendly faces and smiles.",Disneyland_Paris
186738737,4,2013-12,United Kingdom,"According to my 3 year old our whole trip was  magical ! She did however say this about the Eurostar and Hotel in the same conversation!!!The Good; Good value for money if you book early, and stay HB on site.Definatley gives you that  Disney feeling .The Meet Mickey and Princess Pavilion are an excellent addition since I was last there, as it takes the guess work out of if you'll meet someone you love, even if the queues are a bit long it's worth it.The Parades as always were spectacular, and the park isn't looking tired yet, despite being open for 20 years!Great for adults as a couples trip, or families with kids, but take your buggy, even if your child hasn't used it for years! It's a sensory overload and they get tired very easily, not to mention it's handy for carrying a day's stuff!There's easily a few days to be had here, so plan your day. Look at the map and work out what you want to go on before you leave, and what rides you can go on (if with small children) to avoid disappointment.Make use of the fast passes, and ask at your hotel desk if they can give you any extras.Lots to do for little ones!The Bad; Overcrowded on a Saturday, so try and go mid week if you can, and aim to do the more popular rides when the parades are on to avoid queuing all day.This is not a relaxing trip, so if you need some rest book an extra day to compensate for time lost on lay ins.The food is awful! Expensive & impossible to get anything healthy so bring snacks from home and try and book half board to save some pennies. Also if you have anyone in your party with any allergy's bring a few meals from home for them just in case.If going in the winter it can be COLD so take plenty of warm layers.Overall well worth the visit but do try and plan your days, take food & drinks with you from home and prepare to feel like a child again!",Disneyland_Paris
186727453,5,2013-11,Ireland,"We enjoyed a fantastic 3 night 4 day trip to Disneyland Paris in November 2013.The weather was cold and it rained heavily on our first night and morning, which was disappointing. After that it was crisp and bright and once we were dressed appropriately, it was fine.The highlight was definitely Fantasyland, my 3 year old loved it. Her favorite attractions were Dumbo and the Mad Hatters Teacups. it was annoying that the teacups were closed until the day we were returning home but I made sure we were in the park at 8 for the start of magic hours.We were lucky enough to have halfboard meal vouchers are part of our package, as the meals are very expensive. However, in the cable car coffee shop a hot drink and muffin was    4.95, which is similar to what we pay at home. McDonalds in Disney Village was also an affordable option (with free wifi).A fantastic trip overall and I think it was better for a small child that Disney Florida as all the  worlds  were in one park, as opposed to having to choose between them in Florida. The parades and the fireworks were spectacular. The  Disney Dreams  christmas firework display at closing was the highlight for me, it was stunning.A magical family holiday was thoroughly enjoyed.",Disneyland_Paris
186721943,5,2013-11,United Kingdom,"I've always wanted to visit Disneyland Paris particularly during the Christmas festivities and made up my mind to take my children this year. We traveled with Edwards Coaches, staying from the 24th November 2013 to the 27th November 2013 at Disney's Hotel Santa Fe. Our party consisted of 4 adults in our 20's, 30's and 40's, and 4 children aged 3yrs, 7yrs, 8yrs and 9yrs.Now, I've been lucky enough to visit Walt Disney World in Florida on two previous occasions just over 10yrs ago and I was warned not expect DLP to be anywhere near as good as WDW, that I would find it disappointing and no comparison to WDW. And in all honesty, DLP isn't WDW...it hasn't got the sunshine for a start and nobody does friendly like the American's in my opinion...but it didn't matter! Maybe it was because I went with my children, niece and nephew whose excitement was infectious. Maybe it was the Christmas atmosphere, the lights and the beautiful tree on Main Street that put us all in the Christmas spirit. Or maybe it was just that DLP is a simply amazing place. Whatever it was, we had the most amazing time!!!Although the park was busy, we didn't experience a great deal of queuing for rides, I think the longest we queued was 20mins but as the line kept moving we didn't really mind. There is a sign at the entrance to every ride giving an approximate wait time and we didn't bother queuing for Its a small world or Peter Pan because the queue times were around 45mins, too long we felt for the children to wait around. My niece has only just turned 3yrs and we were slightly concerned that we'd struggle to find rides for her to go on, so we were really pleased to find that other than some of the rides with height restrictions, she was able to go on a majority of things which meant we could all go on together. She even liked The Pirates of the Caribbean ride! The parades were brilliant, although its advisable to get a spot early if you want a good view. However, because it was November we didn't want to stand around getting cold just to be at the front but as most of the floats are built so that the characters were above head height we still had a pretty good view standing towards the back.The choice of food isn't great, its pretty much the same food served everywhere but at different prices so you basically choose between paying 20euros for a burger and fries or 10euros for a burger and fries. Being a family on a budget, we chose the cheaper and it was ok, on par with a KFC, Burger King or McDonalds, and most importantly for us the children ate it. We also took in some rolls, snacks and flasks of tea to have during the day which meant we didn't have to stop for lunch.I personally found the park to be clean and tidy, we saw several cast members going around with sweeping brushes picking up litter, although there is no excuse for dropping litter on the floor as there are plenty of bins. Yes there are areas that could benefit from a lick of paint but none of that detracted from our enjoyment of the park. I also didn't experience much of the pushing or shoving mentioned in other reviews, there was a bit particularly when the parades were on but I think thats expected and I wouldn't say it was only the French guilty of this as it was also British people pushing to get to the front. I also found the cast members we encountered to be friendly and helpful and most spoke good, if not excellent English. All in all, we loved our time at Disneyland Paris and look forward to visiting again soon. Its not Walt Disney World but its still a magical place and truely enchanting, especially at Christmas.",Disneyland_Paris
186693600,4,2013-11,Indonesia,"I went to Disneyland Paris for the second time on November with my friend. It is located on Marne La Vallee (Zone 5) and the specific name of the train station is Cheesy. Take the RER A4 (Red line). When purchasing the ticket I recommend that you buy a return ticket (this include a one dat pass) which cost EUR 15.50. One way ticket cost EUR 9. You can take the train from Charles de Gaulle Etoile, Gare du Nord or Nation. Be careful before boarding the train. Make sure the yellow lamp next to Marne La Vallee Cheesy is on. And sometimes the train bound to Cheesy will stop on few stations before Cheesy and they will ask you to move into another train. The last train departing from Cheesy to Paris is at 12.00. During winter the Disneyland will close at 7 pm. There are 2 theme parks: Disney Park and Walt Disney Park. They have 2 different entrance. After security check the Disney Park will be on the right side, the Walt Disney will be on the left side. The Disney Park entrance cost EUR 71 for adult (1 park 1 day). You have to ask them if they have a closing parade on the day you visit Disney Park. We rode most of the ride there. It was not crowded when we visited Disney Park. The average waiting line was 10 15 minutes. They give you a fast pass for free. For example: if the waiting line at the space mountain is 30 minutes, go to a fast pass ticket machine and take out your fast pass. On the ticket it will show a specific time in which you are allowed to use the fast pass. Meanwhile while waiting for the fast pass you could ride other rides.",Disneyland_Paris
186692452,1,2013-11,United Kingdom,"We were a party of five, fifty something grandparents, late twenties parents and very nearly three year old grandson. My grandson had one ambition  to meet Lightening McQueen  and my daughter wanted the whole experience, most particularly to see a 'real' Disney Castle for the first time and to see the fake snow on main street. As she is the eldest of several siblings we had never felt able to justify the cost of a Disneyland trip against the potential benefits while she was growing up. How right we were.Our first experience was an argument with the uniformly rude, arrogant and supremely unhelpful staff. The travel agent had booked the trip when my grandson was two, and had not noted that he would be three for two of the four days of the trip. My daughter was told that she would have to pay on the basis of him being three for these two days, and unless we produced a credit card, now, we could not be admitted. The debate went on for an hour and involved us having to contact the travel agent in England on my phone. Painstakingly, the staff began to move towards the understanding that this was an issue between the park and the travel agent and that the customers should be admitted without extra payment. This was however only after I handbagged two receptionists in my bad grandma French, having dealt with my grandson watching a stream of children skipping past him, and his ongoing questions about when he would be allowed in to see Lightening McQueen. The staff's English was apparently poor, but when confronted with a bolshy grandma loudly asserting 'il est fatigue' 'l'enfant faut manger, il est un petit garcon' alongside the ministrations of the English travel agent, they began to move.... slowly. The fact that a tired, hungry little boy just wanted to see his cartoon hero did not seem to make any impression upon them at all. This set the tone for the holiday.The staff on the park are, in general, rude and unhelpful, bringing a new dimension to the term 'jobsworth'. If you speak to them in English they indicate that they don't understand you; if you then speak back to them in French, they reply in English, presumably because their attempt not to deal with you is clearly not going to work. My daughter, my son in law and grandson waited in line for quite some time so grandson could have his photograph taken with Mickey Mouse. When they got to the front of the queue, Mickey looked at his watch and then informed them in French that it was his time to leave, so no photo. When they protested they were told 'fini, you go 'ome'. They also waited in line to get my grandson's face painted. When they got there they were first of all told that they did not do bespoke requests (he wanted to be a spider, not an off the card Disney character), and then when the staff found out he was not yet three (his birthday was the following day) they said they wouldn't do it at all because under threes were not paying customers. Unfortunately, Grandma was not there with her bad French and handbag (the grandparents went to Paris on the train that day), so he never got the photo or the face paint. The food is expensive and extremely poor quality; finding unprocessed vegetable matter in the day to day offering was extremely rare. We were charged nearly   10 for one very ordinary giant hotdog; two burger bar quality chicken nuggets and chips portions were   35 euros. There is a garage at the entrance to the hotel we stayed in (Santa Fe), to which a steady stream of guests with carrier bags walked backwards and forwards. A packet of crisps that was 3 euros on the park was just over 1 euro in the garage, for example. Obviously, the choice of food was pretty limited in the garage (similar to what one would find in an English garage shop) so this was only a partial solution. For a main meal, the standard fare in both the Santa Fe and Cheyenne was an all you can eat buffet for 23.50 euros a head with only very poor, synthetic food available (e.g., pizza, chips, chicken nuggets, hot dogs, a range of sugary desserts such as doughnuts etc). As diabetics, a lot of what was on offer was unsuitable for the grandparents; even the pizza tasted sweet, and gave me all the physical symptoms of having eaten something very sugary. We don't usually tick the 'special diet' boxes; as lightly medicated type 2s we had never been in any 'catered' situation where we have failed to find a range of things we can safely eat .... except last week, in Disneyland Paris.Guests in the Disney hotels are allowed into the park at 8am, two hours before the general 10am opening, but do make sure you go to the toilet first, as you can't bank on them being open. We found only one ladies open, with the gents next to it padlocked, for e.g. Also, other grandmas out there, don't expect to be able to get a cup of tea while the offspring go on the rides as the cafes on the park are also closed until the general opening time. In fact, don't expect to be able to get a cup of tea anywhere  the choice at meal times in the hotel is coffee, hot chocolate, orange juice, milk or water, and there are no tea  coffee making facilities available in the rooms. The only place we found we could get a decent cup of tea was Starbucks in Paris! There is a Starbucks just outside the Disney park (alongside some other international fast food chain restaurants), but the prices on this strip still appeared to be inflated to a similar level that is found on the park itself. The best I can say about the experience is that the rooms were meticulously cleaned everyday and maintained to a high standard, and, as small children will, my grandson did still find magic in sleeping in a Lightening McQueen decorated room, going on the rides that were suitable for him (and, take note, those with under 7s, there are not huge amounts of these, although we had expected this) and seeing the 'Cars' show, with Lightening as the star turn. However as far as grandma is concerned, the whole experience has certainly dispelled any magic Disney ever held for me. Sorry Uncle Walt, even though when I was not much older than my grandson is now, I viewed the Disney castle icon as a delicious promise that a film or TV programme was going to be really good, as far as I am concerned, you not only ripped me off, but also my daughter and my three year old grandson, and I really, really don't like you anymore. Your 'magic kingdom' was not so much 'wishing upon a star so dreams come true' as 'the nightmare before Christmas' for me.",Disneyland_Paris
186669159,3,2013-12,United Kingdom,"Disneyland Paris was fantastic when it opened we have returned every year but so many things losing the magic. No ice show in frontier land . No shows in the theater in fantasy land or discovery land. Electric light parade gone. The show in front of the castle is fantastic but you have to be at the front to see the full show.The prices are now sky high over the top for simple drinks, popcorn gifts etc. We were told that a team from America are coming in for three months to try and pull the standards back up, which i really hope is true. The toilets are not attended as they use to be and sorry to say some of the staff have lost the friendly Disney welcome.The characters used to be in plenty, but now to see a rare glimpse by luck of a princess as they rush by, you have to be lucky or queue for an hour plus not knowing the princess you will see.Don't get me wrong i love Disney but they need to work harder to return the magic.",Disneyland_Paris
186572621,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"We took our 3 children (3,6 & 8) to EuroDisney during the Oct half term (over Halloween). Theme parks are not really my thing and some of the reviews had left me not looking forward to it that much. I thought I was likely to be hugely disappointed, but I was so wrong. We went for 4 days and still didn't get to see everything. We were very lucky with the weather   bright and sunny every day (which I'm sure made a difference) but the whole experience was fantastic. The Halloween decorations and theme were really good   not OTT or too scary for the little one.The children loved the parades (a month on my 3 year old is still singing the parade song EVERY DAY!!), and I don't agree with the reviews on lack of characters   we got around 30 signatures in the autograph books, and we weren't standing around queuing and waiting for hours to see characters.We found most of the cast members friendly and the rides were just right for the age group of our kids. I think in a couple of years the oldest might feel a bit 'too old' for Disneyland Paris, but it was perfect for them at this age. We didn't have to queue that much (used fast pass for some rides) and didn't find any of the rides broken down or closed during our four days.We didn't stay on the park, but stayed at the Explorers hotel, which we thought was fab, with an excellent pool. We took snacks for lunch (as expensive to buy in park) and did half board premium vouchers. Sequoia Lodge buffet was good, evening meal at Cafe Mickey was appalling food (but was the best experience according to the kids) and Inventions was nice, but not worth the extra money.All in all, an expensive holiday, but worth it for the wonderful memories.",Disneyland_Paris
186561752,5,2013-11,India,"There is only one word to describe Disneyland and that is AWESOME !!! Paris Disneyland is divided into 2 parks   Walt Disney Studios and Disneyland Park. Disneyland Park is so beautiful with so many small scale versions of fairy tale town and inns and characters. The employees at the park are also dressed like fairy tale characters. We went to the park just few days back and saw the christmas decorations, and tree and the parade. Studios on the other hand feature movies and shows and displays with the theme being Walt Disney. I preferred the Disneyland Park over the Studios as i preferred to enjoy the fairy tale land rather than sitting inside the hall and watching shows. The Disneyland Park also has rides themed on the Disney characters. We went into Indiana jones temple of doom roller coaster for a thrilling ride. The main attraction is the Sleeping Beauty castle which is exactly the same as Walt Disney logo :) You can get tickets for the park online and that would be around 10 to 20 euros cheaper than what you get at the Park. I bought a one day ticket and I don't think it did justice to any of the parks. You can get prams for your kids there or you can bring your own. Both the Parks have lot of nice eating places other than toy stores, clothes stores and candy shops. The pizza we ate was Mickey shaped. The washrooms are a bit unpleasant. You can get RER return tickets to Disneyland. Buy them before only as at the end of day you will find huge crowd in the station and no strength to stand in the queue.",Disneyland_Paris

Christmas in Disney is fantastic, everything you could want in one place and when it snows on Main Street  well its just superb BUT don't go on the weekends! We arrived on Thursday,park not too busy,lovely atmosphere, queues not too bad(20 mins average) but on Saturday and Sunday the queues were sometimes up to 80 90 mins and trying to get anywhere through the tides of people was hard work. So if your thinking of going in run up to Christmas  yes its a great place to go as long as its mid week.",Disneyland_Paris
186504123,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"I have wanted to visit Disneyland since I first saw the advert on my Little Mermaid video when I was 8, it wasn't until 20 years later that it finally happened.As an adult I expected to not enjoy as I might have done as a child... How wrong was I.My friend and I went with Bakers Dolphin coaches so we had a lot of time to plan our trip on the way there but the long trip didn't calm our excitement.From the moment the top of Sleeping Beauty's castle came into view everyone was definitely in the Disney mood, even pulling up outside Santa Fe(which may not be the most attractive hotel) made my heart skip a beat.After an excited nights sleep we finally got to the park gates and even the queue(I don't like crowds) couldn't dull my excitement. On stepping into the park we were both in awe, my friend had been before(when she was much younger) and pointed out some of the details I probably would have missed, the attention to detail is fantastic.I loved the rides, although a few had queues that were too long for us most were quite short.After a few hours of rides and a quick munch we spotted our first character, I don't care how old you are, when you see Winnie the Pooh in person you still squeal like a child in a toy factory.I expected the cast members too look at me like an adult out of place but everyone treats you just like you were another kid. I loved getting a hug from Pooh.When we eventually sat down to eat we started people watching... All the cast members smile when they see you, there were regular litter collectors, the cast members walking the parade route were vigilant in making sure children were safe, I even saw one nearly have a heart attack as a child ran in front of a float but he got her out of the way so she didn't get hurt.All in all I love this place, people tried to point out negatives before I went but I never saw any of that there.Will definitely be going again.",Disneyland_Paris
186496180,4,2013-11,United States,"Visited Disneyland for 2 days in November. Could have done with another day if you are taking a small child. Could do it in a day and a half if adults teenagers. We visited on a Friday and Saturday, Friday was very quiet didnt qeue for more than 25 minutes for any ride. However on the Saturday was obviously very busy and some rides which were 5 minutes qeueing on Friday were now more like an hour. The biggest negatives for us, were some French visitors smoking constantly throughout the park even though there was designated smoking areas. This was particularly a problem when waiting for the fireworks at night and when qeueing for rides, especially when there was small children everywhere. There were signs saying smoking fines but these went unnoticed which was disappointing. Also there were not very many characters about to get autographs and photos with, and the princess pavilion qeue time was 2 hours, but they couldnt tell us which princess we would be meeting at the end of the qeue! Disneyland was great for small children but could do with a couple more bigger rides for adults. All in all it is worth going.",Disneyland_Paris

This park is all about characters and childrens rides I took my 3 year old princess and she had the best time here seeing Cinderella , rapunzel , Snow White , and many more getting to spen 1 1 time with them at the princess pavilion was the highlight of her trip , . This is a beautiful park and is magical at christmas time the decorations and parades were amazing . I have been to Walt disney world Florida a couple of times and yes this is a smaller park but it is perfect for little ones save disney world for when they are older .

186296255,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Stayed in the Hotel New York, as we had previously, and were not disappointed. Rooms kept clean to good standard. Breakfast environment good and did not feel rushed or cramped as in Sequoia Lodge. Inside the Park was where the real disappointment came. Not so many characters available around the park as there used to be. Parades no longer get the children involved. We had blue badge passes for easy access to rides, only to find that some rides now have a booking system   this was not explained at the time of pass issue at City Hall. Ate in several restaurants on th half board tickets, but selection of food in some retsaurants not very appealing and quite pricey. We will be leaving it for a few years before visiting again.",Disneyland_Paris
186280427,5,2013-6,United States,"We avoided so far to go to the Disneyland in Paris. After more than 22 Day's at Disney in the U.S. (Orlando & Anaheim) over the last 15 years, we thought the EuroDisney couldn't reach our expectations and we would be disappointed and always comparing to our former good times at Disney. So a long free weekend was ahead and the weather forecast around our usual travel spots really not the best. Only for Paris the iPhone forecast showed some dry days. OK, Disney. We arrived as planned in the afternoon at the parking lot. (30    per Day!) for the Camper. There is a designated parking area for approx. campervans. You can see Space Mountain or the Tower of Terror from the lot. Walking distance to the 2 Parks (Disneyland and Disney Studios) and to the Disney Village around 10 minutes. If the moving walkway is turned on in the right direction, even faster. For the arriving evening the visit of Disney Village was planned. It is located in front of the 2 Disney Parks. Shops, Restaurants and Entertainment (Imax, Cinema, Show) Next Day the two Parks. If you think the entry for the parking lot with 30    is done, wrong. They check in the morning your arrival date and inform to pay for the upcoming day. So the 30    are from 00:00 to 24:00. The bathrooms located at the campervan area should be avoided. Dirty, the showers look very bad. Use the restrooms near the main gate. The 2 Parks need no explanation here, in fact we wasn't disappointed. Compared to the U.S. Parks maybe it wasn't as detailed and clean. The stuff a little bit not so friendly. Overall it was a nice experience to be at Disney again. 1 Day 2 Parks 59,00    p.P. leaves room for do it again. The Campervan site close to the parks and the Disney Village gives the possibility to go back to the camper between the visits or even go to the Village without visiting the parks itself. Only the 30.00    for 24h. (not overnight) for campervans is much too high in case of the bad condition of the restrooms on site and the lack of power supply.",Disneyland_Paris
186240558,5,2013-11,United Kingdom,another great time.  Q's were short due to the time of year and the weather was ok.  Cold which was expected and a bit of rain but nothing too bad.  All the rides were great and our 16month old loved it again.,Disneyland_Paris
186219891,3,2013-11,United Kingdom,"Just returned from a family trip to Disneyland Paris and, although we had great fun, we were disappointed by the number of attractions out of action. At this time of year half the kiosks and restaurants are closed so it was difficult to find a suitable place to eat in the park. Space Mountain, Lightning McQueen, Backlot Tour, all closed. Plus some others were temporarily shut due to technical faults. Toilets were pretty poor and not clean. Aside all of this, the park still has a magical feel and the little ones loved it. Christmas decorations added to the magic! We've been twice now and I am sure we will go again one day but our preference will be to return to Florida where they know how to do things properly!",Disneyland_Paris
186197279,4,2013-11,United Kingdom,"I have to say as a family we loved Disneyland, my four year old daughter will remember this forever and if she doesn't we have about 1000 pictures to show her she went. I don't understand reviewing  the park  and  the studios  as different attractions, they are basically one and the same thing you wouldn't go to one and not visit the other! So I'll start with the studios.... the walkthrough in Studio 1 is very pretty, lots of glitz and glamour a few restaurants to make it look all hollywoody, we managed to get on the tower of terror ride and we between us we did all of the rides in toy story land, Crushes coaster had big ques whenever we went near it and we didn't do the rockin rollercoaster, purely because we ran out of time on the days we were in this side of the park, we didn't see any parades over this side as they only had one per day and we were in the other park when it was on.We did see the stunt show though, which although probably not as good as you would expect it was worth seeing and was only 45 minutes long and you get to see lightening McQueen!The other side though, Disneyland Park, is where the magic really is, the castle is right at the end of the main parade route and it towers over the park and looks amazing, various lands spring off to the right and left on the walk up to it, attention to detail is amazing, frontierland was well done out, the haunted mansion is a bit of a yawnfest, the runaway train is quite good though and if you are lucky Jack Skellington is hanging around this area! Each area has a  main ride  and lots of little ones the peter pan flying ride is lovely for children and is something I've not really experienced anywhere else, we did enjoy the buzz lightyear laser blast ride, this though breaks down frequently.The parades are the highlight and seeing my daughter get kisses and waves off the characters is something we would probably go back for and getting high fives off piglet was good fun, the laser and firework show at the end is brilliant and we were lucky enough to see the magic Christmas tree show as well   it does seem to need to be a bit more Christmassy but that's just being picky!There are a few points that I would love to see Disney improve on though they are  niggly  things and although it didn't affect the enjoyment we had its certainly worth taking the comments on board and if they improved these then it would make the trip even more special.Firstly and this is going to sound weird as I know its Paris and they speak French but not much of the world speaks French, whereas a lot of the world speaks English and as its Disney, in theory English should be the first language then if need be translated to French, there was three occasions where something was said in French and then not translated which is ridiculous! This was during the stunt show when Tow Mater was talking, during the haunted mansion narration and at one point during the tower of terror.Secondly   shutting rides when there is no real need, maybe they should be weather dependant? Was there a need for space mountain to be closed completely?Thirdly   there needs to be better management around the princess pavilion, we went into a 60 minute que with no idea who my daughter would be seeing, as much as she likes Mulan, Pocahontas or Jasmine we got lucky with Sleeping Beauty, however if there was a way to be able to put your name down to meet a specific princess, a fast pass to Rapunzel for example it would make for much happier little princesses...Fourthly   a serious lack of characters.... we met a few who were dotted around but at one point there was a meet and greet with Duffy the Bear (WHO?) they should have more of these meet and greet points and have it made more clear who will be there, where are all the new characters? I would have loved to have seen Mike Wasowski, or Sully in a parade but they weren't there? Mary Poppins was though, now don't get me wrong I know she is a classic but no kids care for her anymore do they? Update the characters!and lastly, there is an issue with the toilets I only saw one person cleaning them in three days, doesn't mean they aren't cleaned but its not a regular occurance and some of the sights I saw were not pretty! Plus there are no signposts in the park, finding a toilet is a proper mission and when you have a 4 year old who is desperate that's not a good thing.Like I said though despite these points it is amazing and its definitely a place we will be looking at going to again in the future",Disneyland_Paris

185986212,3,2013-11,United Kingdom,"This is the second time I have visited Disneyland Paris. This park is now 20 years old and it it showing its age. Water fountains not working, ponds with no water, paint pealing and just the look of an ageing park. Don't get me wrong but this is still a fun place to go, but in comparison to Disneyland California which is now almost 60 years old, this is starting to look run down. I also find that the organisational skills at almost every attraction is very poor. I am not blaming the staff but the supervisors and more importantly the management. There are the odd members of staff that look totally bored with what they are doing, perhaps they need to be weeded out and more enthusiastic staff employed. The number of attractions that have  breakdowns  which turn out to be lack of staff is very noticeable. Time for the senior management to wake up and see what is going on. There are a lot of good staff being badly let down by the supervision. As I said earlier still a fun place to go but could do better.My biggest gripe, and I know I'll end up with a lot of stick for this, but this is a park full of children and the number of people smoking throughout the park I feel is irresponsible. This needs to become a smoke free zone. Have smoking areas not the whole park.",Disneyland_Paris

I'd heard great things about the park at Christmas and my boyfriend wanted to try the Studios Park so we decided to go back and do both parks on a weekday (last Friday!). Wow! What a difference! We barely had to wait for even the most popular rides like Thunder Mountain and RC Racer (queues 15 minutes max). We didn't use a Fast Pass once  the last time we exploited the system with military precision! We also saw a lot more characters wandering around than last time  I suppose on a packed Saturday their minders are worried that they'll get mobbed! Without rushing, we managed to see all the parades: Stars and Cars at the Studios, the 20th Anniversary parade which we missed on the previous visit because we were pressed for time, and my favourite, the gorgeous Christmas Cavalcade. Before closing there is a special show with the lighting of the Christmas tree, and of course the Disney Dreams of Christmas light show with animation projected onto the castle. I was delighted to discover that the Christmas version of Dreams was completely different to the previous show.During the week the parks close at 6pm (Studios) and 7pm (Disneyland) but you won't feel like you ran out of time.Highlights: Adorable giant Christmas tree lights at Toy Story Playland, the Christmas Cavalcade, meet and greet with Jack Skellington, Disney Dreams of Christmas",Disneyland_Paris
185773069,5,2013-11,United Kingdom,"We used a company called Opipare Travel. Parisshuttlebus.comfound limited information about this company, so i suppose took a risk. However risk paid off, firstly being the cheapeast quote of 50 euros from airport to Disney Hotel. and secondly, despite the lengthy delay on arrival through passport control, our driver was waiting patiently for us with a name card, . He took our luggage from us, was extremely polite (we were fortuntate to have a vehicle to ourselves) and we arrived at our hotel within 30 minutes. We had initially considered the train but at a cost of 40 euros for a family of 3, it was definitely worth paying the extra for the hassle free personal service. We paid the driver cash on arrival, rather than via internet. We used Opipare for our return journey to the hotel, and once again, the driver arrived at a time to suit us, which allowed us more time for the last few hours in the park. Excellent service, will definitely use again the next time we visit Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
185559905,4,2013-11,Canada,"There is something strange about going to Disneyland all bundled up. Mits. Toques. Scarfs. It was 2 degrees in Paris for our Disney visit. Brrrrr.Firstly, I'll say that getting to Disney was a breeze. The RER puts you right on Walt's doorstep. Disneyland, Disney Studios and the Disney Village are right there. Easy mcsqueezy. *tip* The Disney Village is the only place with free wifi. Ok, we hit up Disney Studios first. It's small but fun. A couple of attractions were closed, probably because its winter time. The only ride that required a wait was the Crush's Coaster, since it is so popular and also since it breaks down a lot. It's pretty innovative and worth the wait.I felt that most of the attractions, although enjoyable, were smaller and under themed versions of the American originals. The Tower of Terror seemed like a much shorter drop and the Aerosmith coaster had no narrative. The same can be said about both parks actually. The careful theming that is employed in the US that makes the park so special is somewhat glossed over here and that is on top of the understood degradation that comes with the language translation. Regardless, we had great fun. Zero lines. Some cool new attractions and some old faves.Then we popped over to Disneyland Park. It's beautiful. The entrance gate and Main Street USA is a triumph. Simply majestic with a touch, and I mean a tiny touch of European flair. The castle is pink! Nice! The park is beautiful and the attractions were great. Again, some of the theming was lost, but still fun and unique in their own way. Any rides better than the US you ask? Yes actually. Big Thunder Mountain is bigger, faster and zooms underground to get to the ride on an island! Cool! Space Mountain, Mission 2, was Space tastic! A fresh design and great effects made this ride better than the originals. It's a Small World was modified with Christmas fun and also included a small section for my native Canada, which is not the case for Orlando. Shame on you Orlando!Rides that were unique? The Phantom Manor had its own unique story line that tied into the fact it was situated in Frontierland. Kinda weird, but cool. The Pirates of the Caribbean was not as spooky, but very fun. Lame rides? Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril, was actually periless. Very lame. This could have been an amazing temple of doom style indoor mine chase ride (which is what was originally planned, but they cheaped out). Mystery of the Nautilus.....skip it. And where is the Jungle Cruise? Boo!The park is also littered with cool little attractions like a pirate landing and a Alice in wonderland maze. Simple and fun.Let me say this much. I'm a Disney fan. If you find yourself at a Disney Park every few years like I do, then don't be surprised if you're a touch disappointed with Disneyland Paris. With that said, all in all, my wife and I battled the elements and had a fabulous time. It's an absolute sight and fun for the whole family.

The rides, parades and atmosphere is great, its not too big to walk around which is a big plus point when you have kids, we had a buggy but you can hire them for 15 euros and you can leave buggys outside the rides which is great. Loved all the rides we went on especially the peter pan ride, buzz light year and dumbo. Have a good look at the map and plan what you want to go on so you dont miss anything beacuse its easy to get swept up in everything. I went to the park in orlando and yes it was better for the simple reason that the staff bend over backwards for you and try their best to create  the magic .....staff here looked bored, uninterested, unhappy and didnt look particulary bothered about serving you so if you expect 5* service from the staff i would not come here because you will be disappointed. Other negative is food hardly anywhere was open to eat, would have made sense to have protable burger hot dog stands dotted over the place, so i would suggest take some snacks and juice with you. All in all we enjoyed it and we will be coming back but i can see why others have wrote the reviews they have and will not be coming back.

Best way to do trip is stay at a hotel off park and buy food to take in for the day. The rides for the littlies are brill, and the rides and attractions for the older kids are also brill, but all come with long queues. If you can   do the really big rides later on in the evening   one of the major roller coasters only had a 10 min wait at 8pm, as opposed to over an hour during the day. My last visit was in October 2013 and although it was good   4 of the roller coasters broke down whilst we were in the queue, showing that the attractions are getting old. We particulally liked the car show and the other cinema shows   a little change from queuing and fast rides   and a chance to have a short foot rest! I went with Gold Crest Coaches and the whole experience was not short of exceptional   the organisation and the efficiency of the drivers was brilliant   I would thoroughly recommend them. As an extra we had a further day in paris at the end which was well worth the money and we loved every minute.",Disneyland_Paris
185383709,3,2013-9,United Arab Emirates,"It's well maintained but most of the rides are old and not that much thrill. One can manage to spend a day here. There are a lot of new fun parks built in differrent parts of the world, which provide more thrilling rides are good value for money",Disneyland_Paris
185350906,3,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Went to Eurodisney for the 4th time since it opened approx. 20 years ago. Great atmosphere and our daughter loved it. However it is now starting to look tired with some of the attractions looking a little dishevelled and unkempt. Some of the rides closed early for some reason and the runaway train was closed x 3 times due to a fault which really disappointed our little girl. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride is a must as always but this had been changed too so somewhat lost its surprise element as the galleon had been moved. Food was expensive and the staff were a little rude. The best part of the trip was the hotel (not on the park   I will add) but it was approx. a 5 min bus shuttle ride away   the Radisson Blu Hotel was great. The food and facilities were great as was the Spa!. It was approx.   140 a night for a family night whereas a stay at the park would have cost us approx.   400   shocking as it was only the Davey Crocket lodge which is a static caravan! After Eurodisney we went to Paris which is a real must! Visited the Champs Elysees, Arc de Triomphe, the Eifel Tower and Notre Dame   absolutely amazing trip but may miss Eurodisney next time!",Disneyland_Paris
185329568,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,each section of the park has one big draw ride . very clean . we did not experience any ques at any of the rides incuding the big draws . the main st parade is terrific and so is the firework show . favourite ride star tours . we stayed at the hotel new York what had great access to the park . the only complaint I could level was breakfast seemed very expensive,Disneyland_Paris
185303806,5,2013-11,United Kingdom,"Iv been once before when I was little,I came back as an adult was completely blown away by not just the rides  shows but also by the staff.Having friendly fun helpful staff makes a big difference.I thoroughly enjoyed every part of the park and became a kid again when I saw the parades.There is loads to do and there are things for all ages (well done on that) The whole place was magical and I can't wait to go back next year.",Disneyland_Paris
185219317,5,2013-11,United Kingdom,"The park was wonderful as usual and looked even better with all the Christmas decorations. We were visiting for 5 days staying at the Disneyland hotel for my sisters birthday. The parks were very quiet when we arrived and the rides had hardly any queue, the longest queue we saw was for princess pavilion at 30 mins. It got busy throughout the weekend but that is to be expected but still had a great time and found everything was managed well. We was there for the beginning of the christmas season so there was a lot of press around come the weekend and made a really exciting atmosphere especially when it came to watch the new Christmas dreams. It was amazing as was the parade and the Cavalcade. It really is the best time to visit disney. We only ate in 2 restaurants in the park, Walts and Auberge de Cendrillion, the rest being in the village or the hotel. We enjoyed our meals in both of these restaurants especially Walts but the Character interaction in Auberge was just perfect. All Cast members we encounter throughout our stay were wonderful, so friendly and couldn't do enough to help, they really did help make the trip such as making lots of fuss over my sister and her Olaf (from frozen) plush, and helping us find  the perfect  place to watch the parade, as our usual spot was taken up by the press.Overall I have to say this has been one of our favorite trips and can't wait for the next :)",Disneyland_Paris
185126658,4,2013-11,United Kingdom,"Firstly the hotel and parks.Stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne, basic hotel but the only time your see it is when it's time for sleep.Parks   well it's Disney, it was Christmas time and all the magic was there, from the parades to Main Street when the wind blows through it, the decorations move and it starts snowing, it's a odd thing to see people just stopping and working out what's going on.Staying in the hotel grants you two extra hours in the morning before it official opens to the public but all your get is a few rides and photo opportunities in an empty park.Now the main part   how expensive is it?Best take a lot of money with you just for food & drink if you want to use the restaurants.Once you are there you don't have much choice where to eat, but here's a few tips.Hotel Cheyenne charges nearly   5.95 a pint of beer (based on 1.15 Euro), so does most of the restaurants in Downtown Disney. Restaurants there start from   20 for a meal not including drinks, the steakhouse is just under   30. The hotels will offer a buffet breakfast and you will witness guests not bothering with plates but just loading up trays (I mean more than one) of bread rolls, butter and ham to take to the park, not leaving a lot for anyone else.If you want a beer visit King Ludwig's in DTD as between 5:00 and 7:30 they offer half price drinks,   3.05 a pint or a 4 pint glass for   8.50.McDonalds do a meal deal plus nuggets with a beer for   8 and is the only place in Disney that has free wi fi (do the express ordering on the consoles near the door or expect a long wait)Earl of Sandwich offer good subway type 6  with soup for   8.80Sports Bar offers a hotdog & fries for   8.85, don't know what it was like as no one was bothered to take the order.If you are staying in the park hotels, walk through DTD towards the train station, exit the park and go through the doors at the train station and head left towards a shop called Relay   beer is   2, sandwiches for   3.40 and bottles of coke from   1.60 or pay   3.40 in Disney. Come out head right and your back in the park.Well worth the visit but probably not again for a while as there's one new ride next year (Ratatouille) then nothing until around 2020.Hope this helps you save a little money.",Disneyland_Paris
185094236,4,2013-11,Belgium,"Disney Land is the most beautiful park from all the attraction parks we ever seen.We are coming there every year and each time we dont want to leave the park:)The atmosphere of a fairy tale is everywhere there!!just as repeat guests we have noticed that this time some attractions were not in a good statement as it was before.I dont mean security, but for example in Space Mountaine Attraction we didnt have sound effects during the action the same as in Rock n Roller coaster, as it is very important for a special ambience!!this time we were dissapointed by Crush's Coaster,as we remember from the previous year that in the first minutes Inside of a coaster the small part of a cartoon was recreated and it was more special effects,unless this time everything was almost in a full darkness.in this case this roller coaster doesnt give cool feelings.The rest was perfect as usual!!!except for a food, if you are peson who doesnt it hamburgers you have a big possibility to die from hungriness!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
185044984,5,2013-11,Bahrain,I visited Disneyland just a few days ago and spent only one day for both the parks. Luckily there were no queues on that particular day and I could enter all the attractions without any delay. I had visied the Park about 10 years ago and this time noticed that there is not much change in the attractions  most of them remained same. For example the car stunt show the same sequence of actions were followed this year also which were the same ten years ago  there should be some changes.. The Space trip was also exactly same as of 10 years ago. But these are ok for new visitors. But Disneyland is fabulous and I went through all the roller coaster rides which are very thrilling. I also visited the gift shops which are well stocked with Disney charactors and momentos.,Disneyland_Paris
184973181,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"After a ten year Disney break I have had the fortune to visit Disneyland Paris twice this year as an adult. The first time was in early December at the Hotel Cheyenne and the second was in August staying in the Kyriad.Things are certainly different from an adult perspective, the cost of food, the maintenance issues and lack of shows etc due to funding being piled into Dreams and 20th birthday celebrations.Admittedly they do need to try and bring the park up to previous standards, it is looking a little run down and tired especially in the summer.However! I had an absolutely wonderful time if you allow yourself to be swept up into the fun. I personally preferred the Christmas season and am returning again this December! There is something magical about Disney that even though it isn't perfect, you can't help but feel like you're somewhere special.",Disneyland_Paris
184949313,5,2013-11,United Kingdom,"After a disappointing holiday in summer to Egypt, I organised this small trip out. I went to Disneyland Paris with my wife, nephew and my son for his 3rd birthday. This was an amazing short break, the level of customer service all around the Disneyland parks, shops and hotel was of the top quality level. Each and every person we met were very nice and always willing to help, this is what you want from the staff. I could not believe how easy and simple the journey to Disneyland was from St Pancras (London). We came out straight I the the Disney complex and it was a 3 minutes on the shuttle ride to the Hotel which was brilliant. We stayed at the New Port Bay Hotel which was about 15mins walk away from the main parks, but still it was a nice walk because you can easily walk through the back of the hotel, along the lake and into the Disney Village in 7mins. The entire Disney complex is expensive so be prepared. On Our first night we watched the Christmas light go on both the Disney Castle and the Christmas Tree...which was a truly amazing start of our short stay, later that night we witnessed the Fire work display...the entire place came to life. We booked dinner at the Cafe Micky on my son's birthday and he loved it..we all loved it. All the characters came n sat with us for a bit and kept everyone well entertained. We got a birthday cake and people in the Cafe all joined in to sing birthday wishes to my son.At my hotel I was paying 10    for 1litre of milk for my son so you can imagine how much food price was all over the complex. Tips;There is a Esso petrol station near Santa Fe Hotel where you can buy various things for reasonable price, it's only cos I run out of cigarettes (causes harm to your lungs) that I managed to find that.Opposite the Hollywood Planet is the station so you grab few things from there too, also cheaper. Paris is only 40mins away so if you want a night out sight seeing, its easy to get there and back.",Disneyland_Paris
184945711,3,2013-7,Romania,"I spent 2 days with my family in end of june 2012. One day is not enough for both parks.For your kids it's an amazing place. For teens I do not believe! Very crowded even though we were when there was no holiday. Excellent parad and night show. Maybe a little expensive compared to other amusement parks. Weak and poorly organized show with stuntmen. The show was interrupted about 30 minutes (without knowing why) and I was not allowed to leave the place (incredibly, I was kept by force). Attention, we had purchased tickets on line for 2 days consecutive.When we went the first day I've only got tickets for that day (tickets for the next day stayed at the hotel in Paris). Upon entering the park we were not received until I brought from Paris other tickets. Reason: must be processed together. Incredible!!???",Disneyland_Paris
184823365,4,2012-12,United Kingdom,"Disneyland, many ways to get to Disney, through flight or Eurostar. TGV. The Eurostar brings you right to the Disney village.places to get by, shops, things to do, incase you come direct to Disney, there is up in the station where you can lodge your luggage for a maximum amt of time, but you would have to pay.even if you don't go into Walt Disneyland, or disneylandPark, You can still go into Disneyvillage. But be careful to check the bus times, if you are not leaving with the hotel's shuttle.",Disneyland_Paris
184753951,3,2013-9,United Kingdom,"My sister and I visited 15th   19th Sept 2013. This was our third visit to the park, having had 2 previous magical experiences over the last 3 4 years and having been to Disney World Florida in 2012. If you stay in a Disney hotel it's a wonderful place, it's so shut off from the 'real world'   but this time it seemed that Disney couldn't be bothered with any mid week magic. We arrived on the Sunday in time for the Dreams show, which was FANTASTIC, but a bit bewildering as they close down half the park a few hours before in preparation, but there wasn't anything around the sides leading from Main St to explain why it was closed (we found later in the week all the signs are round the back). We went into Paris on the Monday and were looking forward to spending the rest of the week in the parks....until we got there. Because it was mid week it was much quieter, and because of this it seemed that none of the staff wanted to put much effort in   like they save themselves for the busy weekend period. There were barely any characters at all; and you had to practically hunt them down. The queuing system for the princesses was a fiasco, badly advertised, badly organised, and many a young princess in training left disappointed as couldn't get in to meet them. There were rides closed for the full week, e.g. Crushes coaster 'broke down' but miraculously was back up and running for the Thursday when the park got busier (leading to a 60min  wait), Aerosmith broke down mid queue, the Studio tram tour broke, Haunted Mansion closed, Carousel closed, the Toy Soldiers ride broke down   I could go on. Magic hours was pointless   you could get in the park, but nothing apart from the shops opened early! It was such a disappointment, it was so different from the last time we came where staff couldn't do more for you, walked round with a smile on their faces, characters everywhere. There seemed to be too much emphasis on trying to sell you things, but even the shops were worse than last time   same things in every shop. Very disappointing :(",Disneyland_Paris
184732708,4,2013-9,Sweden,Just for kids! I was expecting to find something for us but unfortunately we were disappointed:(( but for your kids it's an amazing place. For kids the problem is they are getting tired because it's really crowded.,Disneyland_Paris
184704535,1,2013-10,United Kingdom,"It's way too overcrowded. The queues for the rides are 2 hours , too long for kids and too long for adults. Queues for food, coffee, toilets. Overpriced mediocre food with not enough seats to sit down. Few characters to see. Don't bother it's a rip off",Disneyland_Paris
184683045,2,2013-11,Australia,"What a bad disney experience it was everything from rude cast members to broken rides to guests smoking everywhere in the park, even in rides! Cutting lines and CM smiling and not doing anything about it!What a beautiful disney design gone into decay lack of maintenance funding perhaps? Never saw cast members walking around the park with windex bottles or reception at rainforest cafe being rude and refusing to give seats because section is closed and 2 mins later put next customers there while looking at us with an angry face. Is this what Walt Disney created or a sad broken version, the latter I think. M. Iger should go visit Paris and compare with his florida parks. It shows that Disney only owns 40% of the Park vs 100% in Florida. A disney park without Disney Magic should't be called Disneyland.",Disneyland_Paris
184620543,3,2013-11,United Kingdom,"Just back from a weekend in Disneyland Paris. Our kids are 5 & 4. They had a good time, but there was hard work going on behind the scenes! The 'magic hours' that we had because we stayed in the Disneyland Hotel were an absolute waste of time. I heard lots of people complaining about it. You get in two hours before the general public, but what they don't tell you is that most of the park is shut! The fast pass machines aren't even open. The few rides which are open (the carousel, Dumbo and the Star Trek simulator) are queued out simply because they are the only ones open. So your only other option is the shops where you can spend an hour explaining to the little ones why they can't have everything in the shop! The stuff is nice, but SO expensive. In fact, I felt ripped off throughout the whole visit. I cannot believe that Disneyland Paris does not make money. The food is okay, but again really expensive. We ate in an italian fast food restaurant near Its a Small World. The food was nice but they won't let you sit down until you have your food, so you all have to stand in the queue for ages. Try explaining that one to kids who are tired & hungry. The staff are polite enough, but only just.We also experienced a lot of closed rides & a complete breakdown in the credit card system which is a disaster if you're not carrying cash. Booking restaurants in your hotel is must. We didn't for the Saturday night as we didn't want to be tied, but then couldn't get in and then had to traipse around Disney village looking for food. Nightmare. The kids were pretty much unaware of a lot of this and had a great time. But as an adult, I would suggest manage your expectations, take in lots of snacks, avoid the magic hours and book the restaurants!All in all, I won't be going back if I can help it.",Disneyland_Paris
184609509,2,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Having booked this trip because it coincided with Halloween we were lead to believe it would be a really magical experience with a Halloween Parade Fireworks etc. However little did we know that not only were we expected to pay for our daily tickets but also a special ticket for the Halloween Evening or be kicked out of the park at 7.00 when it closed to non Halloween Ticket Holders! That aside, we arrived and had three lovely days of queuing for less that 30 minutes for most rides which wasn't bad. I do believe having visited the park nearly 12 years ago that many rides haven't changed that much   Space Mountain was okay however I came off with such a head and neck ache due to very little to support (it could be an age thing!) ... be warned. Buzz Lightyear was fun for the little ones as well as the adults   a good family ride   use the fast pass   it helps! The Train ride around the park okay to get an idea of size and location of areas.I think it would be useful for slightly more entertainment whilst queuing as the younger ones find it a bit of a bore having to wait for so long. As the week progressed the queues became longer   90  mins for some.The Park was generally clean (bar the toilets) and the staff as polite and friendly as they could be.Lots of merchandise shops that sold more or less the same as each other and generally in my opinion expensive! Food outlets were okay, long queues and a little over priced for my liking.Would I recommend? ...........",Disneyland_Paris
184598757,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"We visited 29 30th October so we knew it would be busy and we would need to queue but nothing that really bothered us if queue was too big we didn't bother going on.

184542336,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"(VERY Late Review) We went in March for their 20th Anniversary, and I have to say it was amazing! The firework show, the parade! It was indeed magical for a first time trip. Lot's of oppurtunities to meet characters, which was a bonus, as I love meeting Disney characters.The only problem was the long lines. We had to wait 90 minutes for Big Thunder Mountain and 75 for Crush's Coaster, so I would definately recomment getting a fastpass! Overall, good trip, and I want to go again!",Disneyland_Paris
184518379,2,2013-11,United Kingdom,"Positives, we stayed in the hotel New York, took advantage of the hotel only access to the studios and got most of the rides done that morning before 10am! If you want breakfast take the first slot at 7am or forget about having breakfast as it's not worth the wait! The kids got to meet the characters in the hotel lounge, without having queue for hours (we were up very early though)We didn't get robbed this time we stayed at the the New York Disney!Negatives, the room safe was too small to take an iPad, so had to carry them about all day, as last time we stayed there our room was ransacked! So make sure you carry your valuables if you stay there!! The room was extremely dated and stale, obviously hasn't been redecorated since the building opened back in 1992! Room service menu is extremely limited, ok if you like pizza or curried bread sandwiches?? (You see my point) There are more adults in the park than children, and when the parade is on route the adults don't think twice about pushing kids out of the way to see! Watch out for rude locals pushing anything and anyone out of the way to get on rides, my 5 year old son experienced this treatment! It seems the park has gone downhill since our last experience 3 years ago at the same time of year revisiting! They have sacrificed a lot by cutting back on main attraction that people wish to experience on their visit to Disneyland! There were next to no characters in the park, the ones that were there you had to queue ages for! The ice rink had no ice and instead were giving out roller blades and in my opinion that is not the making of a winter wonderland that was described with ice skating!!! The high chaparral theatre ice skating show we have seen for the past 7 years seemed to be no longer running or advertised! The restaurants seemed to have staff cutbacks as we soon realised as we had a booking for walts restaurant for 2pm and didn't get seated till 2.40pm! Some of the main rides were shut randomly throughout our visit! The parks needs pulled into this century, we went to the EO theatre, I think they should rename this attraction the 'time machine' it so old I get better 3d on my tv at home!! The early opening on the Monday was a waste of time as there were only some of the rides open in fantasyland, so the queues were just as bad as ever! If your thinking of eating at planet Hollywood, the food is lovely but expect to be in the place for at least 3 hours for 1 course!!Pinocchio ride, if it's a 5 min queue go for it.... Anything longer it's NOT worth the wait unless you want completely let down for your time spent in the queue, only thing it was good for was sheltering from the rain! Overall, be warned its on the down, Walt would be spinning in his grave! If you want to keep the disney magic alive go to Florida!!",Disneyland_Paris
184474692,2,2013-11,United Kingdom,"This past weekend, myself and four friends visited Disneyland Paris. The following is my letter of complaint that I have had to forward on to the company.Dear Sir Madam,I am writing to complain and bring your attention to a number of issues I experienced whilst in your Disneyland Paris resort this weekend (8th November to 11th November 2013). Me, and all of my party, are huge supporters of The Walt Disney Company. This year alone we have visited the parks in Orlando, Anaheim and Paris, happily spending thousands of pounds and we have never had any problem until this past weekend.Our weekend started at the Davy Crockett Ranch, which was perfect for us and in which we only experienced a couple of minor issues. Firstly, we had been told that our cabin would be decorated for birthday celebrations, however this never materialised. This was quite disappointing when it had been promised by the reception staff. Secondly, our premium plus cabin never included the hairdryer or cleaning kit that is said to be included on your website. When we rang up reception about this they told us we had to collect them from the front desk. After driving to the reception and queuing in a horrific queue, we were then told we needed to pay a deposit for the items (none of us had brought any money to the front desk because this wasn   t explained on the phone) and were turned away. We didn   t have time to get money and queue again since it was eating into our time at the parks, and thus members of our party had to go to the parks in 1 degree Celsius temperatures with damp hair. Over the course of the weekend there were numerous problems within the two parks. Firstly we were extremely disappointed there was no big switch on of the lights for the Christmas Weekend. We had seen advertisements all over the TV in the UK saying that the weekend we had booked was a huge Christmas celebration, and expected more of an event than we got. When we arrived half of the lights and decorations were already up, and so on the Sunday (first day of Christmas) nothing was an impressive surprise as we had seen it over the 2 days prior. We expected a grand switch on of the lights down Main Street USA the Christmas tree, instead of a half finished parade on the Saturday which had the dancers props falling apart and no Christmas lights to accompany it. Furthermore, when we booked our half board meal plan with the stay we were assured we would have a    variety of restaurants    to choose from. This was definitely not the case. There was one full service restaurant available in Walt Disney Studios, and a handful in the Disney Park. Out of all of these barely any were available to eat in past 5pm, so our choices for dinner were extremely limited. It was nothing like the dining plans we had received in the other two parks earlier on this year and was very disappointing. We dined at the Silver Spur Steakhouse on Sunday afternoon (since nowhere was available for dinner) and had, to be quite honest, the most disappointing meal I can recall to date. We made reservations for 3:30pm so we could see the 4:45pm parade. A rude waitress seated us at 3:50pm, and our order was taken at 4pm. It was put through the till at 4:10pm, our soft drinks didn   t come until 4:20pm and our wine didn   t come until 4:25pm. By this point we had almost been in the restaurant an hour and hadn   t even seen our starters, which were cold salads prawn cocktails. We called over our waiter and asked how long the food would be, and asked to speak to the manager. An extremely rude woman named Marlene then came over, and shrugged her shoulders when we asked how long the food would be. She was the most unwelcoming cast member I have ever met. We then said that if she couldn   t tell us how long our food would be we would be leaving, as by this point we had 20 minutes to eat three courses and get into position for the parade. We made a compromise with Marlene that if we stayed for the meal she would reimburse our half board meal vouchers as an apology so we could have a meal on our final day (Monday). After she left, our starters came almost instantly. 3 out of 5 of our party went to see the parade, as it was the only time we would be able to see it, and two of us stayed at the table eating our starters. At 4:45pm our mains were brought over, without our starters being cleared away, without anyone asking how the starters were, when the servers could clearly see that our table was half empty. I explained the situation to him, and asked him to keep the food warm in the kitchen and understood it was our fault if the steak we had ordered would be dry because of this. He rolled his eyes and huffed at us before returning to the kitchen. At this point, we saw that the waiters were discussing our table mere metres away from us, and since one person in our party spoke fluent French, we knew what they were discussing was something to be kept until the cast members were backstage. When our bill arrived at the end of the meal, I asked Marlene what we do about getting our vouchers for the meal the next day. She then shrugged once again, and said that she wasn   t willing to give them to us since we stayed for the meal and    lied    about the date we were leaving. She was extremely rude to us, accused us of being liars when we had told her one member of our party was leaving on the Sunday evening but the other 4 were staying until Monday afternoon, and threatened to call security on us if we didn   t pay the remainder of the bill and leave. We even said we   d provide our hotel booking information to show our departure date but she shook her hand and said she didn   t want to know. I was absolutely disgusted at how we   d been treated by the staff in this restaurant. To avoid confrontation, we paid the monies owed and went to City Hall to file a complaint. While we were there, we got told that Marlene had said we were twenty minutes late to our reservation (when we were five minutes early) and again, accused us of lying about our departure date. Due to this, nothing was resolved at City Hall and another hour of our evening was taken up writing a summary of the event. All weekend the majority of the staff we met were unhappy, unwelcoming and unhelpful     not something you expect when you pay the money you do to Disney to experience the world famous Disney magic. We encountered rude staff when asking to pin trade, throwing pins down on desks and walking away when we gave them pins that they    didn   t want    and barely received any birthday wishes when walking around the park even though 4 of the 5 of us were wearing stickers saying we were celebrating. Very unlike Orlando where you can barely walk 5 metres without a    Happy Birthday Princess!    off someone. There were a distinct lack of characters in the parks for meet and greets, and the ones that were out had very limited times so it made it difficult to fit them in among a busy day. Again, we found this very different to Orlando and California. While we were there, the amount of rides which were closed down due to technical problems was disgusting. To name a few, Tower of Terror wasn   t working on Saturday and half of Sunday, there was no sound on Rock    n    Rollercoaster on Friday or Saturday when we went (which is extremely disappointing when the ride is based on Aerosmith   s music), Crush   s Coaster was down on Saturday and Sunday, Toy Soldiers Parachute Drop was down on Sunday, the Studio Tram Tour was down on Sunday, and had been down on Saturday (even though we understand the Saturday was due to maintenance) and Phantom Manor broke down 3 times while we were on it, making us late to watch Magical Christmas Wishes on Main Street USA. If you look at the above, that is the majority of Walt Disney Studios which was down over the weekend. Since we only had one full day in each of the parks, this was very disappointing. We understand that things happen on rides which are out of the control of the cast members; however we also know that whenever any problems happen in Orlando or Anaheim they are rectified in record time. This was not the case in Paris. Finally, the overall appearance of the park was disappointing. A lot of the areas looked like they could do with a clean (mould on the walls by the travelators into the park, dirty looking signs, trash on the floor in the dark rides etc.) and it didn   t portray the Disney look in the slightest. My experience this weekend was one that I shall not forget in a hurry and I will not be returning to Disneyland Paris until it is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company and is at the standard of the other resorts. This weekend my party and I feel like we visited a theme park, and did not feel as though I visited the Disneyland that I have done many times in the past.",Disneyland_Paris
184388468,3,2013-11,United Kingdom,"Just returned from a wet weekend at Disney. Stayed from 8th to 10th November . First some praise: the parades went ahead despite the rain and they were pure Disney magic. The Christmas theme enthralled the children. The fireworks and laser show was also brilliant. We stayed in the sequoia lodge. Staff were friendly, room clean and warm. We especially loved the huge log fire in the bar lounge in the evening. Only one complaint the queue for breakfast on Sunday was so bad we gave up trying to get in. As we were three families we all tried at different times but never did get seated.We would love to have given more stars but the shutdown of attractions became very annoying. Queues built up because of the breakdowns. My sons and granddaughter joined a queue for tower of terror with a 40 minute wait time only to be stuck in the queue for about 2 hours due to it breaking down twice. Also children gave up on the Peter Pan ride as that broke down on the Saturday and Sunday . It's a Small world was shut down during magic hours on Sunday morning along with Peter Pan due to technical faults.So getting up early was a complete waste of time. Also people were streaming into the parks well before 10am so magic hours for hotel guests only were non existent .",Disneyland_Paris
184324858,3,2013-10,United Kingdom,"I have visited Disneyland in Tokyo and that was awe inspiring, magical and definatly worth the money, so much so I actually went twice on two seperate trips. I took my 8 year old to the Paris disneyland to give her the same 'magical' experience I had, however, Paris is woefully lacking in atmosphere. Admittedly it was raining 'cats and dogs' when we went but after making all that effort then we were determined to have a fab time regardless of the weather so that really didn't make any difference. My 8 year old liked the surroundings and found this lovely to look at but being a thrill seeker she wanted to go on all the big rides she could and found it sooo frustrating having to wait for long times to even get on the ride, fast track didn't work for us as we waited and got fast track tickets for space mountain and then the ride broke down making it impossible for us the get any further fast track tickets as those were still active. The food was extortionately priced, and really, is there any need to take further advantage of people when they get inside the resort? The choice was excellent but I dread to think how much anything other than burgers and chips would cost as that's all we had and that cost us 42euro for 3 people. I think because of the rain the parades were cut short which was a shame, and the fireworks were left to very late at night 10.30 ish and we had to be back on our coach by then so missed that display. The place was generally tired and a little run down and some of the workers were not very helpful and clearly didn't want to be out in the rain on a Sunday!!!!!!!!!!!! I wouldn't rush to go back to Disneyland Paris but on the other hand I would go back to take my youngest Grand daughter who is only 10 months at the moment but when she's 8 the park may well of had a facelift!. Come on guys this experience itsn't cheap so how about investing some much needed money.",Disneyland_Paris
184289448,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Love the parade, theming, dreams, magic and rides. Hate that paths need repatching, ramps for buggies near non existant. People smoking everywhere. The magic is  somewhat tarnished by cm not going above and beyond. That toilets arent as clean as need be. That bits look like theyre in total disrepair and little is done quickly. I love disney. I really do but was slightly let down in our last visit. I hope its better by the time we visit again.",Disneyland_Paris
184219850,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Having never been before I was certainly worried by the bad reviews here but was pleasantly suprised! My family agreed the food was fairly reasonably priced and was really delicious. We ate at the cascadeurs, hakuna matata, fuente del oro, caseys corner and cafe hyperion. A good variety of foods were on offer and were really delicious! The queues were fairly long but the advertised times were true and the lines were beautifully decorated. We went in the middle of the summer holidays but never felt like it was crowded or the wait times were too long. The place was beautifully presented with vibrant colours and amazing scenery! We found the staff to be very polite and helpful when walking around a lot of cast members waved with a cheery bonjour and commented on my pin badges! The parades were magical and the night time spectacular was amazing! We found lots of characters walking around who were lots of good fun dancing and playing with the children! I would highly reccomend the riverboat cruise around thunder mountain, the queue wasnt too long and on the lower deck it was so peaceful and relaxing. Calming music was played as you slowly drifted around, even the ducks swam along side the boat!Overall, a truly magical experience!",Disneyland_Paris
184212128,5,2013-11,United Kingdom,"We took our little girl who has disabilities for our first family holiday here. The staff , facilities and rides were amazing! Nothing was too much for them. The green card they gave us allowed us quicker entry and easier access to rides etc. The staff called out daughter by her name and always smiled and made a fuss! Two or three rides and restaurants don't allow push chairs but we could for our girl and wasn't a problem. The allocated areas for the parade and fireworks really helped also! I would especially like to thank Rupanzle, she spent ages with our little girl and later that day spotted here out during the parade and pointed to her and shouted  it's you!  And blow a kiss. Made my girl so happy and me and my wife nearly cry! Thank u!!!!! Can't wait to return!!!",Disneyland_Paris
184057671,5,2013-11,United Kingdom,"Visited the park over 2 days for a family visit and we stayed at Disneyland Hotel which was a surprise treat for us! My three year old son had a wonderful time, he loved meeting Mickey Mouse and Buzz Lightyear and the It's a small world ride. It's a magical place if you love all things Disney you have to go here for the experience. We saw part of the Disney Dreams show at the castle and the fireworks over the lake which were both amazing and special extra touches to the visit. Due to the time of year there were not really any queues to deal with which really makes a difference to the visit and even though the weather was a bit grim it wasn't enough to spoil the fun! All the Disney staff were really lovely and helpful. Will definitely be visiting again and I can't wait!",Disneyland_Paris

183960457,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Stayed at the Newport Bay Club Hotel 28th October till 1st November. . After reading some of the reviews before we we went we were a bit disheartened , but need'nt have been , it was a very welcoming Hotel with pleasant and helpful Staff. The room was clean and very comfortable. The buffet breakfast was lovely, with a good selection. The evening buffet meal however was passable . We could eat at several places in the park as it was included in the package. We ate at the steakhouse once and the sequia lodge hotel twice , the buffet there was really good with so much to choose from for starters , main and dessert, bottled water was included. The park was fab and each evening the closing show at Sleeping Beauty's Castle was breathtaking , so beautiful. !! Although it it very expensive there , the shops and drinks , snacks etc , it is so worth a visit . The rides the shows and the Parades are Magic. The Disney studios are a must , there is so much to do in there. This was our third visit , once in 1995 , once in 2003 , so it had been 10yrs since we were last there. It was worth going back , my husband and I are both in our 60s and so are our two friends who came ,our daughter and her husband are in their 40s and their youngest child who cams is 13 . It was so enjoyed by us all and left us with some lovely memories ( and photos ) so what are you waiting for !!!!",Disneyland_Paris

They don't worry about prices and food etc and they would have loved a trip to Alton towers which may I say is far better that DLP..cheaper and way better rides. the food cost totally ruined our enjoyment..The only thing they have are Disney charactors, but we hardly saw them we had to search for them!! the parade was good but over in 10 mins..We paid   90 a day to eat rubbish plastic chicken and poor beef burgers for 4 of us (and the kids shared whenever they could) We stayed at the Santa Fe Hotel it was ok but no tea or coffee in room we had to pay 12euros about   10.80 for 2 teabags 2 coffee sachets and 2 sugars 1 pack of 2 biscuits ...yes can you believe it cos we couldn't.... in the Disney village they we exchanging currancy at a rate of 79cent to   1 daylight robbery.. we were so relieved to get back to England we had a KFC boneless family bucket with proper chicken for   14 fed all 4 of us, we don't know how lucky we are.. The French do not know how to smile or give you a warm welcome the next time I go to Disney will be Florida cos at least the Yanks know how to give folks a good time without ripping you off..Disneyland Paris overrated, overpriced and overthere!!!!

183936468,5,2013-7,United States,My daughter and I went to Disney World and Disney Land. Both parks were awesome. It was a fun filled day of excitement and entertainment. We were there all day and were still not ready to leave. Next time we will definitely visit for two days instead of one. Disney Land was more entertaining.,Disneyland_Paris
183783808,5,2013-11,United Kingdom,"Stayed at the Davy Crockett ranch which is a 10 min drive to the park. 1st class accommodation, basically a caravan in the woods. It has a super Buffet restaurant attached, best place to eat if on vouchers.

183685570,2,2013-10,United States,"Having been to Disney in California, Florida and Paris (previously) my family and I were really disappointed with our recent visit back to Disneyland Paris. The queuing was horrendous (but is something you have to deal with) aggravated further by several ride malfunctions which meant waiting an hour for nothing. The 'fast pass' queues took as long as the normal queues and to make the situation worse the 'no smoking' rule was not followed or enforced which resulted in standing next to several people smoking and not having anywhere to go! We also made the mistake of eating in a couple of the Disney restaurants (The Steakhouse and Blue Lagoon) and apart from being overpriced and already inclusive of the tip, regardless on how good or bad the service was their special dietary offering was appalling. My wife is a Coeliac suffer and was offered a choice of 3 'microwave' meals (brought out still in there boxes!) as an alternative. It was only after some heated conversation and accommodating staff that we eventually managed to get her something 'freshly' prepared. All in all I would urge anybody thinking of going to Disney to maybe postpone and save up for a visit to Orlando rather than waste their money going to Disneyland Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
183681009,5,2013-9,United States,"I have to say I found myself surprised that there is such a large price difference between the two parks. Disney Paris cost my wife and I just under $170 US after conversion for both of us to get into 2 parks for one day. The same thing in LA would cost us $274 US.We stayed in Paris and had an easy time getting to and from Disney. You just take the RER A line to Marne la Vall  e (it says Parcs Disney next to it). We were staying on Champs   lys  es by the Arc and just got on RER A at Charles de Gaulle       toile . If you aren't near one of the stations that has the RER A line, the main M1 line hits numerous stations that connect to the RER A line. Just go in the direction of Gare de Lyon and you'll be alright.It did seem like maybe Disney Paris was a little bit smaller than the American parks, but nothing too noticeable for us. With two parks to see, we ran out of time in Studios Park side. We were able to hit Hollywood Tower of Terror and Crush's Coaster (both a lot of fun) and that was it. They had a few attractions we hadn't seen before in the Magic Kingdom side like the Alice in Wonderland maze. They also had a Princess Pavilion which is how you can do a meeting and picture with one of the Disney Princesses. It's a bit of a pain because you have to get a time slotted ticket in order to enter and there's a pretty long line just for the ticket. If it's a priority to meet the princesses, get over there first thing and get that ticket. We saw a lot of people who were too late and didn't get in.Perhaps the best part of our day at Disney was the night time show they put on called Disney Dreams. It's unique to the park and should not missed if attending. Kids will love it because they basically put on a cartoon broadcast on the castle itself and then have a lot of fireworks and waterworks.Overall this was our second trip from the US to Paris. We had 5 days in Paris and spent one whole day from morning to night time in Disney. If I had 3 days in Paris I would probably skip it but more than that I would probably choose to go again.",Disneyland_Paris
183679790,4,2013-11,Ireland,"Obviously the queues are an issue but if you are staying in the hotels it is better to go back in a few hours before the park closes as the queues are much shorter. On the Saturday night we walked straight onto Space Mountain. But the real highlight was the amazing light show at the Castle just before the park closed. They have special light up Mickey ears   which we thought were a complete rip off at Eur20 a pop. But they are actually synced to the light show and so light up along with the light show, which the kids absolutely loved. Eating out in the park is very expensive but the Buzz Lightyear Pizza place   over behind Space Mountain   was good value and offered all you can eat pizza & pasta. The fizzy drinks were rubbish, but it was much better value than the sandwich places in the park. And it had a kids play area, which was fantastic.",Disneyland_Paris
183656997,2,2013-10,Netherlands,"Tickets were expensive EUR89 each. Having always wanted to see the Disney Characters, they were only visible every hour for 10 min.

A complete let down for our family   would not waste our time and money again.",Disneyland_Paris
183614839,4,2012-12,Belgium,"I came to Disney last year during christmas holiday with my mum. It was absolutely magical !The attractions were astonishing, but we had to wait really too long.

183564111,3,2013-10,United Kingdom,"The queues are ridiculous and there's no entertainment in them (as you get to an extent in Florida). Basically if you can't stand comfortably for well over an hour you can't do Disneyland Paris. And if you need a loo break from the queue you have to find a member of staff to  allow  you to leave the queue and then rejoin your family. If you can't find a member of staff (and you won't)   you're supposed to hang on. You queue for Fastpass, you queue to use your Fastpass, you queue to eat, you queue for the loo, you queue and then scramble for the free bus and then if you're fit and strong enough you may even get a seat on the bus. Some of the rides are good   Indiana Jones is great, some of the lower tech Car driving things and Buzz Lightyear is good (use Fastpass). Space Mountain is just irresponsible   it says don't ride with back problems. In fact you're guaranteed a back problem once you've ridden   both my teenager and I had really sore necks after being thrown around in the dark in a ride seemingly designed to separate your head from your body. If you want thrills do the Rock and Roller Coaster in Walt Disney Studios   it's fab and much less painful. The parades are  meh , it's just FULL of shops selling Disney tat and spoilt little divas stocking up on tiaras. Signage is lacking so I ended up using my Disney app for this and for waiting times. Which cost   14 in data. And NONE of the wait times were even close to accurate   out by 70 minutes in some cases. Pirates of the Caribbean is very dull, Big Thunder Mountain is quite good (Fastpass or don't bother). In the Florida park there are Disney characters dotted about and you see lots of them. Indeed we saw more in one day in Florida than four days at Disneyland Paris. So we saw Pluto. That's it. We saw Goofy in WaltDisney Studios. One character, two parks, four days. Odd eh? So overall not good enough really. We weren't there high season   not a French holiday. Some of the staff are lovely, many can't be bothered, and you'll struggle to find people to ask other than in the shops. I wondered at which point Disney would say it was full OR put on more attractions or more staff. Suspect it wouldn't. Of the two parks Walt Disney Studios is the better although much smaller. Think Disneyland perhaps better for tinies as Fantasyland very pretty and of course there's a big pink castle. I'm not especially cynical but I'm afraid I felt badly treated and somewhat exploited. Still, I never need to go back!",Disneyland_Paris

183553235,5,2013-9,Belgium,"The Disney park that is located in Marne  la Vall  e is a magical place that will delight your children and also amaze you .For me, the best option is to stay in a hotel close to the park and spend the first day in the   Walt Disney   park and the second day in the park   Walt Disney Studio  .One of the huge advantages of Disneyland is that it is very easy to access and also well organized.In the first park, there are attractions related to Disney cartoons. Some of these attractions are legendary as the   Space Mountain   or   House of dolls   ... These are attractions that have made the reputation of the park.The second park is dedicated to everything related to films, special effects , ... Again there are attractions not to be missed as   Finding Nemo   or   Tower of Terror   .Beyond the attraction, something really impressive is the scenery !

You have Disneyland Paris.Just returned from Disneyland Paris on a trip with extended family, including 4 children 7   13. The experience was underwhelming. Far too many rides not working or breaking down during the day. Fast passes are useless in the Studio park because only three rides have them   so they sell out rapidly. Many staff (but not all to be fair) seem to be going through the motions rather than entertaining guests. Toilets poorly maintained and in some cases entire blocks are disgusting. Women need to plan visits in advance as there are invariable queues   surely Disney understand they need more space for the 'ladies' than the 'gents' ? Not enough rides for the number of visitors   queues of an hour not uncommon for the popular rides. Above all the place seems to be badly managed   there's litter, widespread unplanned ride closures, traffic chaos at the Halloween Party, rides not fully loaded even when the queues are lengthy and poor, overpriced food.Kids are forgiving and will love the rides (once they get on them.) But having been fortunate enough to visit Disney in Florida I would say that the European version is but a pale imitation of the original.

We also did not expect filthy overflowing toilets   come on Disney! Also, when you pay extra for Halloween party tickets it is somewhat annoying that the roads are blocked so you have to get off your bus and walk. Surely it's not too much to expect some traffic management when you know how many tickets you've sold?All in all poor value for money, a tired, poorly maintained theme park.

183391354,2,2013-10,United Kingdom,"If you are thinking of visiting Disneyland Paris, my advice would be: Don't!Either put away a bit more and head to Disney World in Florida, where, as well as far better weather, you get the whole Disney magic with more characters, better service and friendly staff.Or, if you're just looking for a theme park, head to one in the UK and save yourself a lot of money, time and disappointment.Unlike Disney World, Disneyland Paris is just a theme park which happens to have rides themed around Disney films. The majority of the staff are at best unhelpful and at worst downright rude and arrogant. Many of the rides were out of order or running but with many of the carriages out of service, thereby increasing the waiting time.At Disney World, my family and I were impressed with the high standards of the rides, how clean and smart they all looked, the attention to detail all around the parks. Disneyland Paris does not have this polish: many of the rides had seen better days, with chipped paint, parts not working, murky water etc. We visited Caf   Mickey, one of only 3 places you can get character meals and had a terrible experience. The characters were generally far less visible on the whole around the parks than at Disney world.In short, if you want that Disney magic, head to Disney World. If you want a great theme park with exciting rides (that are actually running), head to Alton Towers or similar. But if you want poor service, frustrating breakdowns and arrogant staff, head for Disneyland Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

183381009,4,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Believe it or not Dlp is easy to find once you come off the ferry at Calais. I followed directions off someone else and found it quite easy.Once you come off the ferry you follow signs for the A26 Paris, you will then pick up signs for the A1. On this road it is a toll road, you pick up a ticket from the machine and by the end you will pay    21.40. I advise you get a pre paid card from thomas cook as this will help ease a lot of money problems. As you head down the A1 you will pick up signs for Charles de Gaulle airport. You follow these signs until you go under the runways of the airport and you approach J6, make sure you turn off after the tunnel under the runways and not before. This is also signposted the A104 follow the A4 where you will start to see signs for Dlp. If you are going to the davy crockett you need to turn off at J13 or J14 for the parcs.On the return journey head on the A4 towards the airport and then follow the signs for the airport, this will bring you onto the A1 once you pass under the runways and if you are lucky the kids might get close up to the aircraft passing over then you will see signs for Calais or Dunkerque depending which way you go home. For what you need to travel Halfords do a list of what you need in the car which is compulsory. I did the journey from the ferry to davy crockett in 3 1 2 hours at 75mph. Or it is 130kph when dry or 110kph in wet.Once you are in the parc be prepared for long waits in the queues for the rides including the little ones. But I would recommend planet Hollywood for your food and ask for the waiter called Matthew as he is a spot on bloke who will go out of his way to make your meal that bit more enjoyable.Safe journey",Disneyland_Paris

Last time we learnt to go on rides when the parades were on as it was quieter but this time we only ever noticed that they had one parade a day and the new light ears at 10:30 in the evening. Don't bother buying the food vouchers, we did and it limits where you can eat and most of the places you can't use all the vouchers you have paid for and they pocket the extra 15 euros or so profit as you can't use them for alcohol!

The characters which were out will interact with Adults if they lined up to see them and there is just enough to do to keep you busy. The parades were good with interactions from the dancers.

We had to force the kids to stay awake but it really is unmissable! We booked our restaurants in advance and had some really enjoyable meals. So glad we paid in advance for a full board package as we saved quite a lot of money. We were all surprised at how poorly lit the park was after dark, apart from Main Street.

Food was very expensive if you could find any! Non of the small food carts were open only the few main restaurants which were packed out and left untidy. The food on offer was terrible. Staff were rude and pushy. Every day the rides would break down and even after queueing for over an hour we were told to leave without a full explanation of why yet another ride was out of order. We lost fast track tickets too on a couple of occassions because of this. We went to the Halloween Party and were left feeling like we'd been ripped off as hardly any rides were open and the parade was the same one that had been running all the 4 days we were there, nothing special at all, just 2 floats and some dancers!! It was also very dark with not enough lighting to be able to see where we were walking at times. As for the concept of queuing for attraction, forget it, many people didn't seem to understand how it worked! Frustrating to say the least. This was our second and last visit, we'll go back to Florida instead. Having said all of that the very young children and their parents did seem to be enjoying themselves and it was wonderful to see the childrens faces light up when they saw the Disney characters.",Disneyland_Paris
183203922,2,2013-10,United Kingdom,"I went on Halloween week for four days I knew it would be busy but with a 4 year old and a 7 year old where else do you go I think I spent sixteen hours queuing for rides six hours queuing for food at the parks spending    3.20 for a coke and    3.00 for a bottle of water an average of a    100 euro for a evening meal you can say I don,t think I got value for money I will be in no hurry back although my kids loved it",Disneyland_Paris
183175316,3,2013-10,United Kingdom,"This was my first time to Disneyland and to be honest I wasn't that blown away but it.Firstly, having checked the opening times beforehand, I was very disappointed to arrive at 9.30, and have to queue and wait to get into the Walt Disney Park, which stated that it would be open from 9.00.Swiftly moving onto to the Disneyland Park, the distant views of the castle looked great, however, up close it looks like its in need of a bit of a regeneration.The initial queue times were not too bad, however as the day went it turnt out to be ridiculous. Even the queues for the restaurant were terrible. I recommend to take snack or a packed lunch into the park beforehand as the food stools are very expensive 2.90 euro for a standard packet of crisps.Overall, too busy and very expensive!",Disneyland_Paris
183158566,3,2013-10,India,"The pink mythical castle certainly gets your attention. Nothing short of a fairy tale. Obviously, it   s a kid   s paradise, so not much for adults. There are a few really good rides for adults though, choose wisely. Almost all the good rides have 30 45 min wait. You can shell out some extra money and get a fast pass, much quicker. We were all adults, so easily finished both parks.Get the ticket which has the one day two park option. Buy it online to save time at the venue. On a good day, the crowd is overwhelming. You can use the trains to get there (RER) pretty straight forward and it goes right up to the gate.",Disneyland_Paris

Paint work chipped and in need of maintenance, which in Florida would be dealt with in a couple of days of an inspection. The horses on the carousel in the centre are no where near the standard of Florida, looks shabby. The culture is very different and the no que policy for seeing characters has to change. Children get barged out the way and adults (french) quite often will step over your children to get there. Had a few words about this every day. Smoking when queuing for the rides is disgusting. Thats of course if the French can be bothered to que.",Disneyland_Paris
183056169,4,2013-10,United Kingdom,"This was my 5th time but my partners 1st. Took 7 year old and 11 year old son. Park way too busy this time of year. Queues 60   90 minutes. Rides closed due to technique problems. Not many characters walking around park. Foreigners rude. No queueing just push in front. Lighting in park at night poor. Found the studio park a little quieter but still queued longer than would have liked. Rides over in a fraction of the time. Best rides were hollywood tower, crushers ride, parachute drop, rock n roller and stitch live (very funny). Enjoyed our stay 4 days but was ready to come home day earlier as so tiring. Would not rush back",Disneyland_Paris

183007850,3,2013-10,New Zealand,"To be fair my wife and I did not approach Disneyland looking for thrilling rides so this review will not strike a chord with teenagers and children. Also, I had been to the original Disneyland in California, many years ago, so odious comparisons were inevitable. This is a fun place. It is full of colour and noise music, it captures some of the magic of main street and it replicates many of the rides from the original. The parades were good fun as much for the awe on the faces of the children as for the floats and performers themselves. But it is not the same. The scale is smaller, some rides that excite the thrill seekers are missing and a lot of the little things, people selling home made lemonade on the side of the road, the shooting galleries, the presence of many Disney characters wandering through the crowds, were missing or in very short supply. I do not think it is adequate to argue that we were at the start of the low season so should expect a lesser experience. If the place is open then it should be open properly. Having said all that we did enjoy our day. After a whole previous day in the Louvre this was a wonderful shift from the sublime to the banal but still relaxing, fun and it did bring out some of the kid in us again. I am glad we went and my wife who had nothing to compare with thought it was a great place.",Disneyland_Paris
182989048,2,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Euro Disney aka the financial black hole. Pay for the tickets, expensive but the kids will love it. Another 15 euros to park which turns into more fun and games at the end of the day with inadequate lighting? No picnics in the parks so decide between losing a couple of hours going in and out or paying a minimum of another 50 euros for four substandard meals in the park? If the service provided by the staff was good then fair enough but at no stage was it any good. Buying food, queue to order you food then queue to collect but check before you leave as they don't bother to compete your order. Your food will go cold as you wait for them to complete your order in between completing the incomplete order that they got wrong previously. To queue is obviously not a verb in Euro Disney dictionary as staff ignore people jumping the queue and left it to the masses to sort out. Even purchasing expensive fragile products does not bring a smile to the staff's face as they throw them into plastic bags without a bag without a care in the world. I won't talk about the toilets because there are families which read these reviews but as my friend said,  Don't look for the toilets, just sniff them out...  The only reason I give this 2 stars is because my daughter got to see the princesses in the parade. We decided against queuing for 2 hours to see the princess because we actually thought it may be a good idea to actually get something for out 160 pound investment... We went in October and the place looked run down and in need of some care which is understandable at the end of a busy high season but the lack of customer service beyond the staff in the parades is inexcusable. We will save up and visit the USA version which we hope from reading reviews will restore my opinion of a so called family company. Something 'magical' will need to occur at Euro Disney to get me to return I'm afraid.",Disneyland_Paris

182968523,4,2013-10,United Kingdom,"We spent 5 days at Disneyland Paris with our 9 year old daughter the week leading upto Oct half term. Where to start? The hotel Sequoia Lodge was lovely. Room was spacious and clean. The buffet breakfast was plentiful and the croissants and bread so fresh. Great choice of meats and cheeses etc. You book a breakfast slot but be prepared to queue to get a seat. The evening buffet is great. Loads of choice for adults and kids and really great quality. Even those not staying at this hotel should eat here! Each morning some characters are there for photo shoots ... They are great for the kids and they don't rush them off  makes it very special for them! The park itself is clean, the staff are friendly. Again lots of queues which is to be expected. The biggest issue for us was the expense of eating. Altho lots of restaurants,there a very few  cheaper  lunch options   we found a sandwich bar but it was not suitable for a  simple taste  fussy eater. There is McDonalds too if needs must. Expect to pay 25 euros per adult And about 15 Euros per child without drinks at the diners   possibly more. We made up some cobs from the hotel breakfast buffet to get us through the day. When it comes to shopping it's a kids paradise ... All the shops price the gifts the same and most stock the same items   no multi shop stalking to try And get a bargain ! We enjoyed our time here and fully recommend pud hotel,",Disneyland_Paris
182953754,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,Try getting to cordon off limit between Adventureland and Peter Pan 15 minutes or so before the 10 a.m. opening to get onto Pirates ride.Not easily accessable from elsewhere so good chance of getting on quickly.No fast passes either,Disneyland_Paris
182935502,2,2013-10,United Kingdom,Hotel Magic Circle was ok. Breakfast was very good. BUT Disneyland Paris was so disappointing. The place needs upgrading with more rides and needs the magic and sparkle advertise on their website. There doesn't seem to be a cap on numbers allowed into the parks so they were crowded with waiting times around 75 mins per ride. (Some fast pass machines were broken). With the extortionate price of tickets it works out at tens of pounds per ride!! The staff in the parks seemed indifferent to visitors with a take it or leave it attitude. The only saving grace was the parade and the evening fireworks. A sad experience   definitely better in the USA.,Disneyland_Paris
182926194,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Just come back from a 4 night   5 day trip. This is the fourth time we have taken our daughter who is now age 5 and we can't wait to go back!Ignore all the miserable moaners, how can you miss the Disney magic? Just walk down Main Street and see Sleeping Beauty's castle and the magic begins.Yes you have to queue for rides but you are in a theme park so what do people expect? We used the magic hours 8a.m   10a.m for hotel guests. Peter Pan's flight, Dumbo, Carousel, Buzz Lightyear and Orbitron were open with 5 minute queue times. You can then get in line for another ride when it opens at 10a.m. Get fast passes early as they do run out when all the time slots have been used. Also the park is open until 10p.m, a lot of rides such as Pirates of the Caribbean & Phantom Manor had no queues at 9p.m. So there are ways to beat the queues!!We saw loads of characters around the park, also you can visit Mickey back stage and one of the princess's at the pavilion. This is well worth it as they really interact with your child and you will get great photos.Disneyland Paris is a great size for small children before they are old enough to manage Florida. The light show at 10p.m with fireworks is amazing, well worth staying up for. Food is expensive but it is going to be isn't it?! We always take loads of bottles of water and snacks from home.If you want Florida pay and go to Florida! If you want a cheaper visit to Disney across the channel with all the great magical rides and fantastic thrill rides then visit Paris, just throw yourself into it and have a wonderful time (like we did!).",Disneyland_Paris
182917369,1,2013-9,United Kingdom,"We're a family with young children so it seemed like a great idea. But from the moment we arrived at the airport to the bitter end it was endlessly terrible. There is no signage when you get to Charles de Gaulle airport to help you at all. So that was a bad start but we worked it out.When we arrived at the train station, again nothing to explain what to do now, but again with three small children and suitcases we wandered round the multiple bus stops and worked it out.The buses come every 20 minutes, so when ours arrived the huge queue of teenagers piled onto it, leaving us and about 30 other people standing there to await this bus to go all the way to the hotel and come back to get us, we'd been up since 4am to get here and the kids were starting to get very tired etc. But with the prospect of getting to the hotel and back to the park we could cope with it.We finally just jumped in a cab and got to our Hotel, The Magic Circus. I stood with one person in front of me and one person behind the counter for 45 mins waiting to check in. Meanwhile several other disgruntled guests came down to complain that the desk were handing out multiple keys to the same room, including one family who'd had a stranger walk in on his children.By now my kids are going spare and the hotel is doing nothing to speed up the check in process at 3pm in the afternoon. You would think they might have guessed people would arrive around that time.After an hour or so we are checking in and they haven't got my booking, but give me keys to a room and we will 'sort out the issue later'.We get to the room change and head back out to wait for the packed bus to take us back to the park.Upon arrival i head off to buy tickets and am directed to an office where I'm told that it's cheaper to buy annual passports than tickets for all of us for 3 days. I'm also told to buy a certain level of passport otherwise there are 'lock out days' that we won't be able to get in on. So i pay 600 euros for these annual Disney passports for the whole family.They tell me when we head into the park I have to get the passports validated before 6pm. FIne i send the rest of the family off to actually see something in the park whilst i go to get the passports validated.I wait 40 mins in a queue before being told that the whole family must be here to get the passports validated, plus as i have my youngest child in a pram i have to leave him there as we is not allowed up the 2 steps to get to the desk to sort out the passports. It's a health and safety issue.So i have to go and search the park and drag my tired and upset family back to the passport office, queue for another 20 mins before they finally see us, take pictures and validate these Eurodisney passports.Ok so we're finally free to look around the park, we've missed the parade, the kids are in tears, my wife's furious with me because i've been away the whole time...But we decide to make a fresh start of it and go from here.Every ride has at least 60 minute queues, some 90 mins. Even to get a snack or bottle or water we were queueing for 10 to 15 minutes.We've had enough for the day so decide to head home on the horrific bus and go to bed and start again tomorrow. A complete waste of time and money so far.I try to buy the kids an ice cream but the staff treat you with such contempt that i thought i must have been in the wrong area, five people behind the counter chatting to each other whilst i stood in front of them trying to catch their eye, when i asked where i should order the ice cream he just scoffed gave his friend the 'who's this idiot' look and said 'here of course'. We go back to the hotel for some awful food, and to sleep.Day 2, get up and head to the park. Only to be told that the EuroDisney passports we had been sold yesterday for 600 euros were not valid for the rest of our stay as they were Lock Out days.I nearly hit the roof, I found someone who worked there and looked like he actually knew what he was doing. I explained that we had been missold these very expensive EuroPassports and that we just wanted to leave now and get a refund.  No  Disney doesn't do refunds.He called someone on the walky talky and sorted it that we could get into the park. Told us just to go to the entry point and explain, they would then check the files and let us in.We walk over to the ticket point...  It's a lock out day you can't come in  i know it's a lock out day but it's on the system to allow us in  we can't access the system. You'll have to go all the way over to the other side of the park to get someone else to check it By now I was close to tears, the rest of the family way past that point.We trek over to the other side of the park have the whole conversation again with someone else who now checks the files and lets us in.FINALLY WE ARE IN!!But every ride is again 60 to 90 minute waits, to eat at a restaurant you have to book (no one tells you this) even the awful fast food is a 45 minute wait.They have given us a couple of passes to go up through the exit and get straight on a ride. I take the kids on 2 rides, we queue 50 mins for a bad hamburger...and leave.The contempt of the staff, the queues, the borderline inedible food, the terrible atmosphere where people think nothing of yanking your pram out the way to get past, the start to finish nightmare that this holiday was has actually made it hard to write this review.I still get upset when i think of the fact that my family's one holiday of the year was the most appalling experience possible. EuroDisney looks great, but it is the worst holiday you could ever wish upon your worst enemy.Of course not everyone would have this bad a time there, but be warned. This was a very expensive mistake and has ruined the Disney brand for us and our kids. Their movies have such care, attention and quality, but EuroDisney destroys that all.",Disneyland_Paris

So I was excited to check out the 20th Anniversary of Disneyland Paris. Bought our tickets ahead of time on line. Still had to go to the ticket window to retrieve our pass? CA Disney scans your printed ticket at the gate and hands you a pass. Don't understand why D Paris can't do this. Luckily, there was no line when we were there. In fact, most wait times were 5 minutes! Loved that! The only long line was at Crush Coaster (Hello Anaheim, why can't we have THAT ride!!). Disliked the smokers. Even though there were smoking areas, no one stops people from smoking in line, or anywhere else. Food prices are the same as Anaheim. They need to expand Walt Disney Studios Park. Not enough rides there. Had fun just the same, though.",Disneyland_Paris

I need to mention the supposed extra 2 hours from 8am to 10pm at the Disney park. This was a joke, we were given the attractions which would be open, very few and 2 of the areas Frontierland and Adventure land were not open at all. On arrival we, and the rest of the Disney Hotel guests were treated to approx half of the very few that were supposed to be open, with sorry we are not opening till 10am.

The parades are all as one would expect, the hotels are good and the junk food on the park is same as everywhere just more expensive.Try for the best of the hotels you can afford as you seem to get more characters turning up in the more expensive accommodation. Bt of you don't want to push the budget too far just book a character breakfast and you will get lots of photos with the characters.

182790523,5,2013-10,Netherlands,"Although there are two parks in Paris, this is of course the main park that is attractive for people of all ages. From 'it's a small world' for the very little ones to attractions like Space Mountain for the older ones. The park is well maintained and the staff is very friendly and helpful. It is the typical quality that you can always expect from Disney Theme Parks.Be however prepared that the Park is quite large and you will have to walk long distances that will be very tiring for the younger children. I have seen this cause a lot of stress by parents so my advice is to prepare well and only target the attractions that you like best.On top of that, most of the major attractions have a systems called Fastpass where you can get tickets upfront to return at a set point in time to avoid the longer queues. This can be very helpful so study that upfront as well (it is not that difficult). The previous two advises are especially useful on busy days (which is basically all holidays and weekends). Disney also lowers the capacity of the rides on the less busy days so there are almost always waiting times at the most popular attractions.The Entrance fee is expensive and most of the food in the restaurants is also slightly on the expensive side. There is however a large variety of restaurants and my advise is to be there early on busy days.",Disneyland_Paris
182785410,3,2013-10,United Kingdom,"We took our kids to the park on a weekend before half term. OK, we expected to queue but not up to 75 minutes for some of the rides! Yes there is a fast pass but these are limited. I also understand that we were in France but smoking in a queues around children in a children's theme park  really???For the amount of rides that you are able to go on and the amount it costs to get into the park (btw book tickets before and get discount, I booked with 365 tickets and got a good discount). The whole site looks as though it needs updating, faded paint and broken displays.

182772868,3,2012-11,Norway,We have been to the parks in the US but had to make a trip here for the day to give the kids a break from Museums and Monuments in the busy city. It was much busier here as we went on a day that the French schools were on holiday so even though we though it was off season and on a weekday   the park was absolutely jammed with even more people than we experienced in the US parks. Overall very clean and friendly as you expect from Disney   but not a fun break from the crowds in Paris. Trains from Paris and to the airport very easy   but high speed train to airport is very expensive as noted elsewhere on site. Worth a trip if you have kids that want to see it   but check out the school calendar in advance if you think you are going in off season!,Disneyland_Paris

Understanding that this is the end of the season, but many rides and resturants were closed or closed very early. Understanding that it is Europe and waiting in line has a different standard, but the park did a very poor job of trying to control the flow and the bad behavior.

The queues were at least 60 minutes long for a five minute ride a more scaled down version of the American experience. There are lots of photos taken at a price ready in a very short period of time. Feel a lot could have been done to protect people in the queues we were soaked to the skin so do take umbrellas and waterproofs at this time of the year.

Food was very over priced and not all the cafe's and restaurants were open. Didn't see one disney character walking around the streets to take pictures with (only seen them do a parade). If you wanted to go on a ride the line up was anywhere from 30 60min waiting time!! so as we wanted to see everything and didn't want to stand in line for long periods of time we missed out on a lot of them. We also went to walt disney studios which we saved till last which I'm happy we did as we did it all within 20mins as there was nothing open and not much to look at.

Even the things I thought I'd hate   the parades and the Disney Dreams show were superb. Rides were also excellent but best suited to younger children and young at heart adults. Very few thrill rides. Now the downsides.The prices were ridiculous.The food is generally over priced and of poor quality. The worst aspect were the guests. Regular queue jumping for the rides, and pushing others out of the way to get to meet Disney characters. This includes adults pushing kids out of the way so that they could get the signature of an adult dressed as a Disney character.I ventured into Disneyland Paris full of anticipation, and left a snarling angry man who had to shout, argue, threaten, and physically manhandle other guests, just so my children had a fair opportunity of experiencing the magic.

182450739,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"We really enjoyed our visit, ticked all the boxes :) Food was expensive in the parks but we went to Disney Village to Earl of Sandwich before going into the park and this worked out cheaper",Disneyland_Paris
182446662,3,2013-10,United Kingdom,"We recently spent 5 days at the disney parks and stayed at one of the disney hotels. I recommend using the benefit of the magic hours to get into the parks early although one one or two rides are open only.It's been a couple of years since we were last here but we were amazed about how expensive the park food is which isn't any thing special, tip bring your own food and drinks in with you.At the weekend they are long cues for the rides but on week days it's less busy. While we were there the rides broke down most days and they do look a bit of an update. Staff were friendly enough but didn't speak much English but things were we'll sign posted. I often saw the staff just standing around chatting amongst themselves irgoring guests. All in all we had a good fun time when the rides were working, the disney characters were good and the shopping was great but has Paris lost some of the disney sparkle?.",Disneyland_Paris
182392093,3,2013-10,United Kingdom,"It was our second visit to Disney Paris the last time being 7yrs ago and I wouldn't bother again. Rude staff, queue jumping going on all over and staff allowing it, smell of sewers in the shops and the toilets were disgusting I was nearly sick with the smell. Prices are way over the top    9 for a hot dog!!!! Not much to see, parade and fireworks not a patch on florida. A member of staff ran their hat cart into my little girls legs and didn't even apologise just looked at her and walked off. The kids enjoyed it though so it gets more than 1 from me for that",Disneyland_Paris

182329576,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Wow what can I say, we absolutely loved the Disney Park! From the moment you walk into Main Street you get the feeling it's going to be good. Almost everything you see is done to such high standards i.e. Rides, shops and Caf  's etc. We probably covered every possible ride and land within 3 days (Including the Studios), and there were only a few my 6 yr old couldn't go on. Fantasy Land is probably the best for young children, followed by Discovery Land, Frontier Land and then Adventure Land. If you are staying in the Disney hotels I would strongly recommend using the Magic hours between 8 10 as you can go on the rides without queuing. You can only go on some rides within Fantasy Land and Discovery Land during this time. Yes yes I'm sure the Disneyland in the US is bigger blah blah, but this Disney is lovely and worth it for the kids.P.s. The food might not be cheap but I didn't mind paying above the normal rate if it keeps the park to such a high standard.",Disneyland_Paris
182318223,5,2012-11,Australia,"We visited Disney little over a year ago and i can't wait to go for our next visit. It was just my husband and i and yes, it felt a little strange being the only adults queuing for character photos and autographs, but who cares? it really is magical. facilties were spotless, staff friendly overall (only encountered one staff member who spoke only French but we still managed to blunder through it with smiles). Yes   it is expensive   you pay for the magic and queues were frightful over the weekend (from 5 minutes on the thursday to over 2 hours on the saturday), but i'm afraid, that's just something you have to accept. Be prepared for screaming children   there is no avoiding it. But in the end, there is just something about Disney that makes you a child again and who can put a price on reliving your childhood, even if only for a weekend.",Disneyland_Paris

182250448,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Of course it is not Florida but for younger children it is ideal. The day needs careful planning to make the most of the time and of course if your are in a disney hotel then you get the benefit of the magic hours, meaning you can get on some rides before the queues begin. That said, there really should be more rides available during these magic hours.Sadly, it turned out that we were there during the French school holidays and as a result the park was much busier. At its worst the queue for Buzz was 1 hour and 15 mins according to the digital report on the noticeboard on Main Street. Luckily we managed to avoid queues for too long.... The longest being Autopia for about 30 mins at about 8.30pm. We had lunch in Auberge de Cendrillion, using our half board vouchers. Again, it was extremely busy and we have found it to be much more relaxing in other years. The children still loved to meet the princesses though and the food for the children has improved. I agree with other visitors with regard to the costs in the park. It is advisable to take drinks and snacks with you. It is frightening how much you can spend on so little! Similarly the prices in the shops seem to have escalated. A princess hairbrush for ten euros! We also took princess dresses with us. The children like to wear princess dresses in the park but again it is advisable to take one with you as they cost 60    upwards to buy there.The parade was much less special than in previous years with little interaction with the crowds. However, the disney dreams show was spectacular. Luckily there were plenty of meet and greets around the park too during the day, and these are much better organised than in previous years, less pushing and shoving.All in all, we had a great time. The rides were super, characters great and there is no mistaking the magic of Disney!",Disneyland_Paris
182212713,1,2013-10,Canada,"It was well cared for and clean with very expensive and poor quality food. Overall it was a day out but I do not recommend adult travellers bother with this park. Kids were having great fun as kids do. The quality of the park is way below my expectations. The attached movie studios were an even greater disappointment. If you have children, by all means take them. It'll cost you about    250 300 for your day. I was leaving an attraction when I overheard a man ask a staffer in English where the toilets were and the staffer replied no English. The man then said toilette? The staffer pointed into the distance.",Disneyland_Paris

Highly recommended!Only downside is the food, if you want eat luch at, well, lunch time, then be prepared for huge queues. Since the crowds were low, only few counters were open at every restaurant. And the food, well, it was ok, but too greasy for my liking.",Disneyland_Paris

182133272,1,2013-10,United Kingdom,"HUGE HUGE HUGE disappointment. This should be called Disney EuroMall because it's really just a massive overpriced shopping extravaganza with a FEW real rides scattered about.Restaurants about the park that closed at 4PM!!!!! Rides that closed at 6PM!!!! Funny that the gift shops stayed open well past closing though. Enter the park after sunset and STILL pay full day admission. Venues and rides that were breaking down and or generally not open to the public. And big doses of that lovely French attitude when we inquired why things were closed. It's Disneyland Paris so I was ready for the pushing and shoving by the hoards of frog families invading the park...what I wasn't prepared for was the ridiculously overpriced food (160z Coke Zero    4.99; hot dog for    9.00, etc.).When all was said and done, we felt like we'd paid some    130 per person for the priviledge of just being able to walk inside the gates of a large Disney shopping mall. What a FAKE experience.I could almost imagine a disgusted (and cryogenically frozen) Walt Disney rolling over in his frigid grave at the shame that has been brought upon his good Disney name.",Disneyland_Paris

Our trip was a birthday present, my girl had never been to Disney Parks so we planned a trip to Paris and to the Disney park in France. The park was overall dirty, the toilets were smelly and not kept well at all. My girlfriend said the ladies toilet was disgustingly dirty. The cast members were not in their role. They were often seen just standing around and chatting amongst themselves and did not really care much to appreciate and be nice to the guest. I would rather spend my money at some other park or somewhere else in Paris. Dont get me wrong, a few of the cast members were really nice but the majority failed us. Also things there are beyond expensive. Yes in general a park is expensive but here basic things were too expensive.

They do speak English but they will laugh at your face when you speak English and refused to serve you. They are arrogant and rude. I was knocked by a man walking on the streets and I almost fell down and he did not even take a look at me. The staff are more concerned about their lunch times where everyone disappeared during lunch and all the rides are stopped for more than an hour. the staff are without smiles and the rides are only average. nothing fantastic.(Note: My trip there was a few years ago). i dont want to go back Paris again.,Disneyland_Paris
182048628,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,"Our little boy is 2 1 2 and this Disneyland resort was perfect for him. We have been to Disneyworld in Florida many many times and were quite unsure of what to expect. It does not have the American over the top Disney staff but remember it's France and in the main they were very friendly and helpful.You have some big hitters in the thrill stakes. Tower of Terror, rocking roller coaster and space mountain is very good but I do think this park is more suited to the little ones and there were very few things apart from the thrill rides that our little boy could not go on. My only negative would be the food served in the parks. Poor quality at expensive prices. Go into the Village for lunch. Earl of Sandwich and MacDonalds are serving the same as you get in the park but for a fraction of the price.We are going to Florida next year but if you want to treat your little one to some Disney magic that does not involve a long haul flight I would recommend Disneyland Paris no problem and we will be back for a short break many times I'm sure. We were there for 4 nights 5 days had were practically dragging our son out the door to get the Train to the Airport. The Train station is a complete added bonus and I would recommend taking the fast train from DGB to DLP as it only takes 10 minutes. More expensive than bus transfers but the time and stress factor make it an easy swap.We will be back Disneyland Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

We were sad to see something different. The park has seen better days   looks like the upkeep stopped a few years ago. Paving stones broken and uneven at the entrance. The park was dirty and unkempt. The cast had a dull apathy with a few exceptions. Loved Pirates, Haunted Mansion, Space Mountain and the dragon under the castle.

The park was decorated for Halloween and looked beautiful! The decorations were basically sunflowers and pumpkins with a little Disney creativeness thrown in for good measure also sound effects which were fun. The Halloween parade was beautiful and that was running about three or four time during the day, We managed to get many rides in both parks on the Friday and came back to see the  Disney Dreams  show in the evening after dinner. This show is brilliant and a must for all. My little Granddaughter said  Even the fireworks are magic and don't bang!  This is very true even though they are magnificent and big there is no scary noise for little ones. The park was busier on Saturday and Sunday but still a very enjoyable time was had by all.

181819352,1,2013-10,United Kingdom,"We stayed at Davy Crockett range which was great. This gave us the 2hrs extra in the morning from 8.00 to 10.00, what we never knew was only 3 rides and a few eating places were open. Not a single character to be seen anywhere till 11.00 hidden behind the Videopolis building.We went in on Friday 18th October, 5 of he main rides where not open. We queued for the Autopia ride, it was laughable watching the staff repeatedly try to start the engines as one after the other cars broke down. We were a party of 8 in 4 separate cars, 3 of these cars broke down. What amazed me most was that on Pirates of the Caribean ride, Small world ride, Tram tour ride and Peter Pan several boats, trams and cars where sent around empty, even though hundreds of people were queuing. It didn't make sense and just frustrated everyone as there was not explanation or reason. Most rides exceeded the estimated times by ages, spoiling the whole day. The staff operating the rides lacked enthusiasm, looked lethargic, and really just couldn't be bothered.As for prices, you would need a second mortgage to eat there everyday.Got to just say again the behind the scene tram ride was delayed over the advertised time by over 1hr with every tram only filled by 50% and 2 trams either withdrawn or broken down.Having been to Florida Disney I would say save up and have a trip to remember not a French disaster.",Disneyland_Paris

I think is the content of their  magical  is not  magical enoughto me Disney is magical mainly due to it parade, I and my family had great fun with parades in Anaheim and Tokyo, is really magical and lively, the one over here... is just merely for the sake of Parade that they do the Parade, my daughter still enjoy it alot, but it fail to capture me and my wife heart, it just lack of that magical touch.2nd the food in the park, well... they really need to add some touch to that... it lack of variety and try to hard being  French  wayThe small world is close, and I am really disappointed with that, I try very hard not to mention the word small world to my daughter for that whole day.The bright side of this park is ... you do not need to wait very long for almost all the ride maximum 45 minutes, but usually 30 minutes will get you ride on, something you won't able to do in the other Disney park.However the Dream show at the park closing, does spark little magic out of me... it worth the wait for the park closure to catch the show, to me is even better than the parade itself.They got the right park, rides and everything but just need to put more magic portion in it to make it  MAGICAL",Disneyland_Paris

However, It was the coldest place on earth, & we wore multitudes of clothing, but still had to run from one attraction to the next just to stop from freezing. Many of the attractions were closed.The other park with the studios was good, & we were able to see some stunts being done, which were very impressive.On the down side, it is terribly expensive, & I paid   30 for a hooded sweatshirt for a 6yr old, &   32 for a small teddy.The best idea is to book a package with your hotel, which includes unlimited park entry.We are planning to take the grandchildren next year, & we will again go in December.",Disneyland_Paris

Horrid ! Dessert for my 3 kids was apple or pear sauce  all served in plastic. Seriously a disgrace ! Almost felt like it was served to make us feel out of place. My children would have felt better if I had brought my own food for them  as this certainly nade them feel like freaks. Breakfast was also a joke ! They had to ask 3 different people about  gluten free  anything  and then they arrived with half frozen bread that they could not safely toast for us.All the buffet had was gluten and milk !

But then Saturday, swarms and swarms of people descended upon the park. We could not believe the difference. The queues were so short or non existent. We made the most of EMH and had no queue onto Peter Pan's Flight, Dumbo, Buzz's Laser Blast etc. We did POTC a few times, again no queues. We did both Space Mountain & Big Thunder Mountain without Fastpasses one afternoon and only queued for 5 mins!!!! Autopia had the longest queue of 20 mins.Character wise, we met loads!!! We had pre booked character meals but apart from that we met the villains, Jack Skellington, Minnie Mouse, Duffy & the best was randomly meeting Belle down one of the arcades. The parades are also good for character interaction, we were pretty much standing by ourselves and my oldest son got loads of attention from the characters so he was thrilled.The food isn't wonderful and is expensive but I was prepared for it.

We knew it was going to cost a lot to get in, but we weren't quite prepared for the amount charged,   250 for 3 adults and one junior, for one day. The whole place is a magical experience, or should have been until one of the assistants selling ice creams couldn't wouldnt understand what a  cash refund  for items she didn't have, meant. She thought that as she had given me my change from a 20 euro note, the amount of change already given had to be deducted from the full refund amount. It was only when another member of staff arrived that I got my money back. By the time it was eventually sorted out, there was a long line of very unhappy customers, this made the whole episode very embarrassing and upsetting. You are not allowed to take your own food into the actual park, be prepared to pay well over the odds for food, it costs us over   100 for the 4 of us to eat a meal. A  cornetto  icecream cost over   3 each.

Overall we had a good 2 day trip and on plus side we enjoyed all the rides we were on, the kids just loved the parades, and loads to do for at least 2 days. Unfortunately a few negatives took the shine off our visit. I agree with many other reviewer that there seemed to be a lack of awareness for personal space from other nationalities   maybe just a British thing but I don't feel comfortable with total stranger standing that close to me or my children. Admittedly this is outwith Disney's control! What is within there control however is their food outlets the expensive prices were to be expected, the poor quality of food, service and choice was not! We went during October holidays and parks very, very busy yet I would say about 3 4 of the food outlets closed. The few that were opened were managed very poorly with loads of people making food (there was literally hundreds of stuff sitting ready at any one time) but very few actually taking orders and money. It was painful the queues for food took at long as the ones for the rides. Which goes onto my next negative, whilst I expected to queue for rides I also expected that the estimated waiting time to be a bit more accurate. We joined many rides at 15 minutes waiting displayed in reality it took double this for majority to get on.

181369223,3,2013-10,United States,"I just got back from Paris and my husband and I went to Disneyland Paris. Here's how to do it. Step 1. Go to the Metro Station...any stop near you in Paris...and buy a 1 day Paris Visitor ticket for zones 1 5. Make sure it's Zones 1 5 and not only Zones 1 3 This ticket covers both metro and the train...no need for a separate train ticket. Step 2. Look at the map of the Metro you are in and take the Metro to a stop where you can get on the RER A Train. For Ex. We took the Saint Gernain du Pres Metro to Chatalet and transfered to the RER A Train. Step 3. Make sure you are headed in the direction of Marne la.Valle, which is your stop for Disneyland Paris It's actually the last stop on the RER A line in that direction. Also note that the RER A line splinters into to 2 different forks where only ends up at Marne la Valle. Make sure that when you go to the platform for the RER A train that the stop of Marne La Valle is lit up on the overhead light board to indicate that the train approaching is the right RER A train ending at Marne La Valle. Step 4. When you get to Marne La Valle, exit the train station. You will see a lot of people get confused and immediately start to get into this very long line inside the train station. Do not do it! At first we thought this was for getting into Disneyland..then we thought it was for the hotel check in. It's not. It's the line for all the people who are buying one way tickets back to Paris. This is at least a 2 hour line!!! But if you bought your Paris 1 day visitor ticket for Zones 1 5, you use this same ticket to return and skip this line. You're welcome. Do not buy one way tickets from Paris even though they are cheaper and some of the sites tell you to do it this way. Because if you do, you will then have to wait in this line from hell to buy one way tickets back. It costs more for the Paris Visitor ticket but is worth it not to wait in the line...which was longer than anything inside the Disneyland Park. Do not lose your ticket! Put it in a safe place. The trains leave Marne la Valle for Paris every 10 minutes up until Midnight I'm told. We had no trouble getting on one. As a 13 year annual passholder for Disneyland Park in California, I wasn't overly impressed with Disneyland Paris. It's dirty, lots of trash, the food is bad, people smoke like chimneys and drop the butts everywhere, and the merchandise is exactly the same as in California save for the things that say  Disneyland Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

181284483,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Firstly I should say that we love disney and are used to the disney experience so we were quite shocked with what we found at DLP on this visit. We went at the end of August during the school holidays. The park was busy yet none of the shops on main street opened until 1pm. All the decent restaurants (Walts, silver spur, blue lagoon) no longer open for lunch. Yet at the hotels all the a la carte restaurants are closed with only the buffet places open at night. The park looked tatty. The rides kept breaking down. The character greetings were a shambles. My 4 year old wanted to see a princess so we queued up at the allotted time to get a fast pass this took over an hour. We came back at the time on the ticket only to have to queue for another hour for the actual greeting  so much for fast pass.I would save your money and go to florida. I it probably won't cost much more!",Disneyland_Paris
181260300,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"This was our first visit with our 5 year old, and she was just in awe of the whole thing. We all had great fun and glad we waited around for the light show at the end of the day   fantastic! The only negative would be the eating places   several were closed, and the service was very slow in the ones that were open!",Disneyland_Paris
181254144,5,2013-10,Turkey,"We bought the one day two parks(Disneyland studios and Disneyland magic kingdom) ticket as we had less time, but actually this one day is too too short to enjoy these parks. I think one day one park should be minimum time kept for enjoying these parks. As you enter one of these parks, don't forget to take the guide booklet available at the entrance in different languages. It clearly tells you what all activities are available, wots their type and what are must to visit. The Disneyland studios offers more indoor activities and magic kingdom offers more of out door activities. Every minute of visit and every thing is enjoyable. One actually forgets the outer world as entering these parks. The live characters, the movies, the buildings and their textures, architects, the themes of these parks are marvellous and fantastic. More activities in magic kingdom are in the after noon so if some one buys one day two parks ticket, then must go to studios in the morning and spent the later part of the day in magic kingdom. The characters parade at 1730 Hours and Fire and laser show at 2030 Hours, both at the magic kingdom are the best part and should not be missed. One must go and occupy the good seats for better view of these two activities well before the start times. Over all Disneyland Paris is the most enjoyable activity when you are in Paris. Disneyland Paris is in zone 5 of Paris metro zone and costs 7.20 Euro per person one way if travelling from zone 1 (central Paris). Its convenient and takes almost one hour to reach the Disneyland metro station from central Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
181164028,4,2013-10,Australia,"We spent the day in Disneyland and loved every minute of it! This was our first Disneyland experience, so I'm not sure how it compares to other Disneylands around the world.TRANSPORT:We took the RER A train directly from our local station to Disneyland. Much cheaper than paying for the transfer on the Disney website, and it was very easy to use. If you can, buy the return ticket before you leave, as there is a long line at Disney to buy return train tickets.RIDES:There weren't as many big rides as I was expecting  maybe 1 in 5 were thrill seekers. This was ok for us though, because I tend to get motion sick, so I had plenty of other options to choose from and was able to fill the whole day with attractions without feeling like I was missing out. A few of the rides were closed, but there were so many options anyway that we didn't run out of things to do.The quality of the rides was great and the overall atmosphere was magical... exactly what we had hoped Disney would deliver. It was wonderful to be a part of scenery that we had previously only seen in the movies  the music was a nice touch too. We were impressed by the fine details in the rides and how everything kept to the theme of each area. We were there during Halloween season, and it was amazing how the whole park had some extra touches to tie the Halloween theme in   even to the point of character voices being heard from the buildings as you walked down the main street.TIMES:It is a good idea to plan a schedule ahead of time and do some research on the rides. We found it difficult to choose which rides to go on because they were mostly underground or in buildings (out of sight) and so we didn't know what to expect   the brochures didn't have any pictures and only a little bit of information (approx 1 sentence) on each ride. There is a rating system though to show which rides are extreme   family friendly  good for young kids   so this did help a bit. We also found that we missed a few shows because they only ran at certain times and we had used up the morning with rides instead of planning, so all of the afternoon shows overlapped and we had to choose. Most of the shows finished by 4pm, so it's best to go to these first and do the rides later.CHARACTERS:We didn't see many characters out and about, however there was a program that showed you when each of them came out, so you could see a lot more if you planned ahead. There was a parade of characters through the main street that was worth seeing.FOOD:We didn't bring any food with us and so we relied on the food within the park. It was quite expensive, but this was expected. There were a lot of food stalls and restaurants available, but I was disappointed that most of them sold the same items, so there wasn't much choice if you just wanted a quick snack. The food service was quite slow every time and lines were long, but the quality was ok and the options were sufficient for a day trip.The park is massive   there is so much to do, even for an adult, and we had a fantastic time. It's a bit pricey, but this is definitely a worthwhile experience in Paris if you have the time   spare AT LEAST a day.",Disneyland_Paris
181153747,3,2013-10,Australia,"It would almost take me too long to write out all the technical problems with the rides but I'll try   Buzzlightyear stopped several times during ride, Haunted Mansion closed for half of one day, Big Thunder not working on two days for periods of time, Tower of Terror in Walt Disney Studios had issues (I included this because most people visit both parks) and fast pass machines not working for many rides. I just did not get the Disney magic   seems to attract an aggressive crowd one group in particular who try to jump lines and do not respect personal space. Didn't bother using last day on ticket.

181121307,4,2013-9,United Kingdom,"Disneyland was the main attraction to us when we were planning our trip to Paris for our 20th birthday, as it was Disneyland Paris' 20th anniversary year. It seemed like the perfect idea to celebrate the end of our childhood.We had a slight problem travelling to the park as the Metro terminated early due to what we understood to be a signal failure. There was a shuttle bus on hand to take us there, but it was ridiculously busy. Once we arrived, we got stuck straight in to the short queues for the rides! We were at the park for the middle of September, so most of the kids had gone back to school (allowing us to run around like children). My main problem was nothing to do with the park, but more the fact our whole trip had been planned out by someone in our party   leaving little room for deviation to the plan or spontaneity   once again, nothing to do with the park.I was rather disappointed that Pizza Planet was closed, but we soon found something to eat along Main Street. We caught the parade once or twice, but only saw one or two characters walking around the park, which was slightly disappointing. Many thanks to the staff for speaking better English than my French. The woman in the crepe shop was very patient when I did decide to try out my francais though, which was much appreciated.",Disneyland_Paris
181118515,4,2013-1,United Kingdom,"I took my wife on a surprise holiday to Paris just after Christmas and knowing she loves that time of year made sure we went when the Christmas celebrations were still going on, and we were not disappointed.They had fireworks and all the Christmasy things going on and we both loved it. Disney know how to do things right and the day we spent there was brilliant. I'll sum up the positives and negatives below:Positives:  They know how to put on a show and you won't be disappointed!  At Christmas, there were so many Christmasy things going on it makes you feel like a kid again.  The attractions were fun and there's plenty to do.  There's nothing like the Disney magic.Negatives:  The queues were pretty long, but I suppose that's inevitable.  The price of the food was bordering on daylight robbery. Most of the locals we saw took packed lunches   defintely do this if you can and save yourself a fortune!But overall, if you have kids or you're a big kid yourself, then it's a must visit!",Disneyland_Paris
181024869,3,2013-10,Ireland,"I am somewhat bias in writing this review in that I have made multiple visits to Disneyland Florida prior to this visit so this park was always going to have a lot to live up to. We visited in the off season which had both its pros and cons.We didnt have to queue for long for any of the rides which is always a bonus. On the other hand some of the rides were closed for renovation etc (which is understandable also).We found it difficult to find places to eat and drink in each of the  lands  as once again places were closed for the off season. It seemed as though only one restaurant was open in each of the lands. Again this is understandable but when we did eat we found ourselves queuing for longer than we would have liked for what was effectively cold food.We spent most of the afternoon wandering the park and saw most of the attractions. We also saw the parade in the afternoon which was fun and enjoyed the Halloween themed decorations. Finally, and I tell not a word of a lie but on leaving the gates of the park and heading towards the exit, I saw what appeared to be a rodent scurry across one of the bandstand pavillons and into a hole crack underneath.In summary, I enjoyed seeing Disneyland Paris and enjoyed the lack of queues etc but the park was just that little bit too quiet for me to enjoy it fully.",Disneyland_Paris
180906926,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,"I'd been to  EuroDisney  3 or 4 times, but the last time was 10 years ago. We decided to return in 2013 with our two boys, aged 6 and 4. We went the first week of September, and the French schools had just gone back, so not as busy as it would have been earlier in the summer. The longest queue we had was 1 hour for Crush's Coaster, but other than that the longest we waited in line was about 30 mins.A couple of things: If you can, I'd recommend going for at least two full days. We had 4 days and easily filled them all (with one day spent in the Studios park) and this really took the pressure off of having to get everything done in 1 2 days, which you will struggle to do unless it's a very quiet time of year.Also, do a little planning, even if it's just noting which rides and things you REALLY want to do. Then focus on getting those done, either by getting to them first thing or last thing in the day when it's quieter, or using fast pass, or just biting the bullet and queuing up for it but at a time you're prepared to queue!Other than being there longer, the best thing you can do is get there EARLY! If you're staying in a Disney hotel, the Magic Hours (getting in at 8am) is worth doing, even just once, to get on a few Discovery Fantasyland rides with little or no queues. We did the Buzz Lightyear ride about 4 times back to back with no queues at all, also Space Mountain and Orbitron all in under an hour first thing, then were first in the queue for Star Tours when it opened at 10. Again, it takes the pressure off getting to those rides when the park is busier later on.Use the Fast Pass system. It does work fine. Sometimes the FP time is later in the day, but it's worth doing, especially on busier days. Our kids understood if we got a fast pass we could come back later and walk on, which helped steer them away from getting into longer queues.One for people with kids   We messed up our times and kept missing the kids normal meal times. We didn't realise we'd done this and didn't understand why they were going crazy! But when you're in the park normal life routine doesn't apply :) So make sure you feed the kids at their normal meal times, it'll help them cope with the excitement and tiredness.You will get worn out... we did 10 13 hour days all 4 days we were there... so try and take a break now and then :) Take water bottles and re fill them for free (water stations are by all toilet areas). Food is expensive, so prepare. Either budget to spend the money (use DLRP Magic website for menu examples) or take food in with you. We did a bit of both and it worked ok. The Free Half Board deal worked well for us and encouraged us to sit down for a proper meal for an hour, which is a great chance for a rest!Remember to enjoy it :) Yes, some people don't queue properly... but don't let it ruin your time there. Rise above it and look around at the amazing place you're in!Have fun... we'll be back again in a couple of years.",Disneyland_Paris
180826832,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Found the park to be very clean and tidy. Lots of staff about to help out and not to much time spent queuing. Probably max of 10   15 minutes. Parade was really good however get your place early and watch out to the ignorant people who come at the last minute and think that they own the park and have the right to stand were they want.   This happened on a few occasions and was always Germans.Disney show at 8 pm is well worth getting a seat for 2 hours before hand.Would really suggest taking your own food in with you as it is quite expensive for food inside the park, 12 euros for a sandwich for example.

It was definitely not up to the standards of the American parks. I saw rubbish on the grounds and in the water ( this is something I was amazed by in the USA ones as they are kept amazingly clean even in the busiest times) there was things broken or looking run down, the staff all looked very bored and unhappy to be there, the food choices were very limited, it is off peak season so many of the food places were not open and the couple that were sold the same food. The toilets all stank very badly of urine, even though we went in there within half an hour of park opening, they also were flooding, clogged etc. The rides were fine, mostly short waiting times which was great.

The shows and characters really are what set it aside from other theme parks, and attention to detail is second to non on everything!My daughter was 6 and I think the perfect age ( and height ) for most of the rides, you can see that safety is at the forefront with the ride operators and a friendly hello and goodbye each time!The Disney dreams light show, is astounding for adults and children alike, and a perfect view was had from the back and from the front ( we watched it both nights).We queued for a maximum of 10 mins on the rides, as the park wasnt too busy on mid week( gets busier closer to the weekend) The food service was a let down, and the prices absolutely insane  but we got the burger meal on the first day (    14 for burger, wedges, brownie and large drink) and to be fair it was really really nice, and good quality!Disney is definately for younger children though, as my 16 year old would not have enjoyed it if she had come along too.",Disneyland_Paris

180598887,2,2013-9,Belgium,"Expectations were high, it was not our first visit. But we were really disappointed. Apart from being expensive, you do not get value for money.During our 2 day stay the park was very crowded, resulting in waiting times at most of the attractions of more than one hour (sometimes up to 2!). Besides that, all major attractions faced technical problems during this 2 day period. Very frustrating to be sent away if you have been waiting for more than 45 min. A FAST pass for the next day is not really a compensation...So: time for some major renovations!They won't see mee again.

180595889,5,2013-8,United States,"I love Disneyland Paris, and not just if you have kids! While many people may think it's an abomination to visit Paris and spend any time at all at Disneyland Paris, I have to say that I think it can really enhance your experience of Paris France. Of course Paris is amazing and wonderful and beautiful, and I would spend (and have spent) as much time as possible exploring it, but if you can squeeze in an extra day and a trip to Disneyland, I think it's worth it. What's great, too, is that Disneyland Paris is not like any of the other Disney theme parks. It has taken on (as one would probably hope and expect) a distinctly European air. And being there, one definitely does not feel like it's  America  plopped down into the middle of France. It's got its own French feeling with the food, the cast members, the aesthetics of the park itself, being able to have beer and wine with dinner, etc. Being there also gives one a sense of what some Europeans do for fun! There are very few Americans, non Europeans there, unlike the city of Paris which is crawling with tourists of course, so, oddly, it also feels much more like a European experience, in that way. Finally, the bottom line is that it's fun, and a great way to spend one or two days with only a short train from Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

180583575,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"We recently had a good 4 day visit to Disneyland Paris. I should say that we also visited Florida this year, so unfortunately, try as I might I can't help but compare the parks in Paris to the Disney ones in Florida. I have however tried to review the parks by pretending I've not been to Florida (which is a million times better) so whilst my review for this and the WD Studios are good they are meant as reviews for people who have never been to the Disney parks in Florida. If you've been there then I can guarantee you'll be disappointed here.We travelled on 7th 10th October which was an off peak time. It was very quiet in the parks which was great! I cannot fault this park for the decor (they had recently put up the Halloween decorations) or the look and feel. It's a very pretty park, particularly the entry. The staff were great   everyone was helpful.The problem with going at an off peak time was that many of the food and drink outlets were shut but that was outweighed by the shorter queuing times for the attractions (we waited one minute to get on Peter Pan!). Extra magic hours were pointless   they only had three attractions open in Fantasyland and nothing else. Good character meet and greets with stations for photos   I only saw one or two characters that didn't have a queuing system, unlike the other park which I will review seperately. There were two parades   the Halloween one (very short but still good) and the main one. The main one I thought was absolutely brilliant   even better than the ones we saw in Florida this year. Yes it really was that good.Food was extremely expensive   but it's Disney so you kind of expect that.Not as clean as I would expect   saw litter here and there and lots and lots of smokers. Even smoking next to you while watching the parades which was vile. I don't mind if people want to smoke but I don't want to! There should be better places for smokers so they can smoke and still watch the parades etc.",Disneyland_Paris

Queues yes, crowds yes, bad food yes but the rides are all very well done and maintained. everything around here is freshly painted and gardens are immaculate. Even the kids' rides are so pretty and have interesting features so as to keep the attention of adults as well. Some of the rides have an advance (free) ticketing system so that you can come back at an appointed time and this worked really well for us.

Lines were taking about half an hour in the beginning and after 3 or 4pm they were taking about 15 minutes. I guess it's a good time to visit at least during the week.Food is expensive and the souvenir shops are REALLY expensive, but honestly some things I just had to buy.The show at closing time was stunning.

180354656,5,2012-12,Argentina,"It's my second visit to this park, the first being when it first opened twenty years ago! And, let me tell you, I was a kid then and a mother of two now, things have changed immensely for the better.Ok, the intel first: We went with my husband at the beginning of December with a 3 year old and a 3 month old (!). 1. Be prepared for the cold. It is COLD! After the 1st day, we put the girls in their ski suits and everything went really smoothly after that. 2. There are buggies for rent and the price is very reasonable. You might want to consider that since you will around much faster with the kids on the buggy. 3. There are queues and they could be long ones. BUT the park has now implemented a FAST PASS in many rides, meaning you get to sort of pre book the time you go to the specific ride and that is very efficient. For the parents of really young ones, like ourselves, we found extremely useful the  baby switch  where one parent goes with the older child in the ride and the other one waits by the exit and enters without having to queue. My older daughter had a blast, because it meant that she went on the ride twice : )If you really hate the queues then I would strongly recommend avoiding the weekends and the holidays. Actually, if you go early in the morning, things run perfectly. 4. Don't be surprised if you see people without children whatsoever waiting to say hello to a Disney character, there are quite a few fanatics out there.5. The food! I have read a lot of complaints about the food and honestly I was very pleasantly surprised. We had a truly superb lunch at the Auberge de Centrillon, where one gets to see a bunch of princesses, etc. I cannot stress enough that the quality was excellent. Yes, it was pretty expensive too, but at the end of the meal we felt it was worth its money. My daughter and husband also ate at the Buffalo Bill's Wild west show over at the Disney Village Park and they found it pretty good as well. As a general tip I would say if you are spending many days at the parks, then maybe try to pack some food for at least one meal of the day. It will save you money and time, because food stalls can get pretty busy too. 6. The parades are contagiously happy, try to stay for the night lights and fireworks show.7. It is worth trying to plan a bit in advance. Have a look at the map and see which places are your priority. We tried to get to this places first and it really paid off. The park is quite big and if you have small children things tend to go much slower. We also tried to avoid entering into shops until it was time to go, otherwise you get to drag endless bags with you throughout the day.All in all we had a really nice time and a thoroughly positive experience. I am far from being a fan of the Disney dream, let alone all this princess empire... BUT the place was clean, well run, the stuff was helpful and we all found things that we liked in the end. Paris has millions of things to see, but, especially, if you are traveling with little ones, give it a chance.Now that I have also visited the park in California I can say without a doubt that the Paris one is a genuine and worth visiting Disney Park.",Disneyland_Paris

180322878,5,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Just back from DLP after being there for their soft change from the 20th Anniversary to the Hallowe'en 2013 stuff. Park looked spectacular and the DLP guys should be commended on the 2013 Hallowe'en parade, which has taken on a much more European traditional route with the harvest. If you're in a hotel, I'd suggest you make the most of the Magic Hours (though whilst we were there, it was always the same two areas attractions which were open), as these are especially useful when it comes to 10am and other parts of the park opening, as you can be right at the front of the queue for any attractions opening at public opening time get on straight away. I had a disability pass, and found cast members very helpful in getting me to where I needed to be, and in explaining the processes. One thing that I did notice, however, is that especially when it comes to parades, they are particularly militant. No matter how obvious your disability, you will not get access to the disability areas for the shows unless you have one of the disability cards from City Hall. It seemed rather harsh at the time (especially when we saw people being turned away despite a clear need), however, do understand their need to police the areas and additionally to correctly account for all disabled people under their care. They're also very strict on the number of people who can accompany you, and we often saw families split up. If you'd rather stay together, consider just getting to the parade show route early and not using the dedicated disabled areas. Always found the toilet areas to be clean and useable (though often hard to find), and the park itself was beautifully landscaped, and without litter. Was a little dismayed to find that the Disney Characters weren't wandering around the park so much (if you go to the Studios park, it's a different story!), but noticed that there were far more about at the weekend than during the week. Given the lack of Disney theming on the park (surprising!), it really needs the characters to make it feel more 'Disney' imo. Make sure you visit Disney Dreams at park closing, it will be the absolute best thing that you will ever do at the park!",Disneyland_Paris
180257435,3,2013-10,Australia,"We went with two girls aged 4 and 5. I struggled to understand why I was spending a day in Paris in such a tacky looking place but at the end of the day there is nothing little girls like more than cheap tat and Disney princesses so we put it on the list. The good things: Friendly staff, well maintained (nice to be in Paris and not see dog crap), good attention to detail, Princess meeting was everything you hoped for, pretty small queues (we went on a Monday outside school holidays, max queue time for a ride was 20 mins), lots of good quality rides for little ones to go on. The negatives: price aside the food is absolutely atrocious (if it met Mcdonalds standards they'd be doing well and in France of all places!), relentless amounts of overpriced tat for sale, parts of the park closed and staff levels not maintained throughout the day for what appeared to be economic reasons, meeting Disney characters was quite hard to do.The verdict: It is worth doing but there is way too much to see and do in Paris to want to spend more than a day here. It belongs in the US, not France. Judging by the queue facilities they had in place you'd be crazy to go with small kids during school holidays or weekends as they would only get frustrated at waiting in line all the time.Tip: If you have girls head (run) straight for the Princess meeting as the line moves really slowly",Disneyland_Paris
180232450,5,2012-11,United States,"While in Paris our family went by train and spent the day in Disney. A short 30 min train ride, which was included in our Paris Pass, was a good time. We felt like we were back in America with everything written in english, however everyone spoke french. Our family felt like this was a good one possibly two day visit was more then enough!!",Disneyland_Paris
180183516,4,2013-10,India,The overall experience was very good. Most of the rides were pretty good. My daughter enjoyed the trip. It may need two days to complete all the rides and activities. Not all was well. Staff at some places were very rude. Food options are not good mostly junk food. It also too expensive. Rest rooms can be more clean given that it used by kids.Carry food for the little ones. Buy autograph books elsewhere and bring a pen as well.,Disneyland_Paris
180166022,3,2013-9,Australia,"Disneyland should be magical. The Euro version of Disneyland has the infrastructure but, even before we visited, I suspected it might be hard to rustle up several hundred bright, friendly, enthusiastic, can't do enough for you staff members in France (sorry to stereotype but they're just not the  Have a Nice Day  types). The day we visited threatened rain so we took our raincoats just in case, intending to put them in lockers until they were needed. That day the lockers were out of action so my husband was told to go to Customer Services where they'd set up a cloakroom facility. It turned out to be outside the park and he was told he wouldn't be able to come back in without his ticket   something he wasn't told before he set out on the journey to find the facility. He had to come back in to get his ticket and then set back out to customer services. It wasn't exactly a Disney moment but worse was to come. Later in the day, we spotted a giant Goofy dressed as a cowboy in the Frontierland area and my teenage son raised his camera to get a picture and told his nine year old sister to get in shot. A young employee spoke rather sternly to us, telling us  No pictures . Are you kidding   no pictures of Goofy wandering through Disneyland? From what we could gather, maybe Goofy was there for official pictures only and not for the freeloading lenses of Disneyland  guests . My suggestion is that if Goofy is only for paid pictures, he's better off not setting foot in public areas where staff are needed to admonish guests for trying to take pictures. Really bad. All in all, there are not too many employees who bother to smile or generally go any way to making you feel particularly welcome. It's an overriding attitude and perhaps a cultural thing but it's probably not exactly what Walt Disney would have had in mind. I had been to the original Disneyland many years ago in 1987 and remembered it as being a place where everyone seemed happy. The same couldn't be said of Euro Disney. The staff (mainly young people) definitely need a few pep sessions or a better understanding of what Disneyland is supposed to represent.",Disneyland_Paris
180150071,5,2013-10,Belgium,"We went several times to the park already before, but this time it was special as our kids are 3 and 5 years old which is a good age to really have a magical experience. It's great to see their excitement when they spot a Disney character walking around, or when they watch the parades. It was a shame though that 'It's a small world' was closed for renovation, we looked forward to taking the kids to that one. Instead we went many times to the 'Buzz Lightyear' attraction which was a good replacement. If you can, try to go during a weekday as it will be much less busy. We arrived on Friday and could do most of the park in 1 day. When we returned on Saturday we had to queue sometimes for more than an hour which makes it more difficult with younger kids and more tiring. I recommend to go for a few days (3 is enough) and take a hotel nearby so you can go back and take some rest during the day. We did it like that, and went back to the park in the evening then to enjoy the fireworks at 22.00 which was one of the highlights of the visit. We had a magical time.",Disneyland_Paris

180093536,4,2013-5,Isle of Man,"We have been here twice and had loads of fun both times. I became obsessed with getting autographs for kids, mostly great, but not always a nice or easy experience. Getting a princess autograph is quite and experience although I got up early to try and get a ticket, I though I'd be the first there at 9.20am, to find the person at the front had been there since 9am. It didn't stop there the tickets did not get given out for another hour, only to be give a time when you had to be back to yet again queue to meet the princess. What we do for our children....The food is expensive and mostly fast food.",Disneyland_Paris
180073544,1,2013-10,United Kingdom,"Just come back from tPirates of the Caribbean irates of the Caribbean is attraction and have to say it was spoiled by our experience on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.On arrival at the park the staff advised us to get a green card for my son with severe learning difficulties, they said it would enhance his experience, and enable him to use the disabled entrances and ensure his disabilities were taken into account. This generally worked well and he was able to enjoy the rides with them taking the time to ensure he had time to get on off the rides, and also queue in a more suitable environment. The last ride was the Pirates of the Caribbean, and on arrival we were directed to the disabled 0entrance and the staff advised there would be a ten minute wait, this was quickly changed to twenty minutes (not a problem), then a staff member said it would be at least an hour but he could not guarantee this. We could not wait for a hour as we had to leave before then, and I told an extremely disappointed son that we would have to leave despite all the others arriving after us having got on. On leaving we went past the main entrance which showed a expected wait time of 5 minutes, so we thought we would try this and got on the ride in less than this.I felt extremely aggrieved that instead being reasonably treated, as one would expect when directed by the staff to a certain entrance, that the treatment received was very discriminatory. The attitude of the staff operating this ride was appalling, and a very poor example of Disney hospitality.",Disneyland_Paris
180025382,4,2013-10,Ireland,"The Disney park was great though recommend visiting the Walt Disney Studio's park first before this one as that closes at 6 p.m. whereas this park closes later after the light and fireworks show. The Disney parade happens twice daily   one at 10.30 a.m. and one at 4.30 p.m.   we went to the 4.30 p.m. one as we were at the other park and were trying to squeeze everything in   in one park in two days :) Get there early too   around 3.30 p.m. as the road just fills up. I recommend bringing a bike lock with you if you have a stroller and are a family like us and want to all go on a ride together   we went on the spinning tea cups which was a huge hit with the two young kids and locked the double stroller at the side of the ride. I also recommend you send your shopping back to the hotel before 3 p.m. if the option is available to you at the hotel you are staying in   thankfully that was an option for us! The food in the park is average, really not that great at all and v expensive and over priced so we brought snack like food in our school bag and a cooler bag of drinks for the kids. Bring your own bottles of water too as you can re fill them and you will be doing a lot of walking. It was also quite warm so you could easily dehydrate. The reason I say this is they charge 3.80e for one bottle of water hence me saying to bring one in your bag!! I would go to the parks on a week day if you can   we went on a Friday early which was not too bad as we only had 5 min waits on a lot of the rides! We did notice in the Disney Village outside of the parks the v next day that there was way more crowds of people on Saturday so we were relived to have done it on the Friday which was when my son James turned 2. Children under 3 go free. My partner went on the Tower of Terror (which apparently is a bit shorter in length than the U.S. Florida one) but he didn't have to queue long   was just a 5 min wait and the Aerosmith store at the back of that ride was not as great as the U.S. one   hardly any merchandise in it! The queues for food really get bad around 12 p.m. and 7 p.m. which is when French people like to eat. So we staggered the timings when getting some food. (Food was still over priced for what you got.) I would have liked to have seen more characters in the parks though. We thankfully got pics with Minnie Mouse and Buzz Light year who happened to be hanging around the Walt Disney Studios park. Meeting Mickey Mouse was at the back of this park and closes at 6.30 p.m. so get there before that if you can. We liked the maze at the back of the park   was great for running the kids around in. Fast track the rides that have long queues and come back in 15 minutes or so. The lack of a chemist or a little shop for toiletries was also a bit annoying as most or pretty much all of the shops here are souvenir type shops. Considering its a park for kids   I think they should have more options in the shops in terms of what you can buy such as baby wipes that sort of thing in case you need it. The light show was lovely and you could get glow in the dark Mickey ears if you wanted :) All in all we had great fun but I think the best memories for the kids apart from some great rides was really the colorful Disney parade and well by the time we got to the fireworks and light show the kids were a bit tired   still it was really nice for them to see! They project some of their cartoons up onto the Disney palace :)",Disneyland_Paris

179989063,2,2013-4,Jersey,"We finally took our kids (10, 12,14) for the youngest's 10th birthday. We spent 3 days spread across this and the next door Disney studio's site. Long enough   I wouldn't go for longer. I would also advise against going with kids that are any younger. The kids need to be taller than about 140cm to get on all the rides. The rides for smaller kids are very busy. Also most of the place is a giant Disney themed shop. So many expensive things to interest young kids. At least our kids were old enough to understand that money doesn't grow on trees and to respect a limit of what they could spend. With younger kids this would be hopeless. The park has had many financial difficulties and it shows   it all looks a bit old and worn out. They haven't had a new ride for years. Having said all of this the kids loved it. Personally I think we went at a good time (April)   not too hot or busy although we were rained on a couple of times.",Disneyland_Paris
179963787,4,2013-9,Malta,"Visited the park from 11 14 Sept 2013. Weather was cloudy most of the time and it was drizzling a bit, but that didn't stop us having a good time. The Saturday was the only day it rained a bit heavily, but it was our last day and we had already gone on all the rides we wanted and seen all the shows so it didn't affect us.I think September is a good time to visit   but try to avoid weekends. The park was very quiet Wed Fri, but on Saturday it was very busy (and the rain didn't help).The rides are great and there's a good selection to suit all ages and tastes from relaxed  sight seeing  rides to action packed roller coasters. Space Mountain (which i believe has been updated at some point) was definitely a highlight, but so were Phantom Manor and Peter Pan. But everyone will have their own favourite rides so it's useless to go into detail on each and every one   it's all very subjective. Let's get to the reason why the rating is 4 5 and not 5 5. We had already visited the park a few years back and something has gone slightly wrong along the way. It's difficult to put your finger on it, but you can feel that the magic has started to fade. While the characters, whom we met along the way and at Cafe Mickey, are all incredibly patient and so charming and great with adults and kids alike, the rest of the crew definitely need to work on their attitude. We came across several people (staff) who would, for example, insist on speaking to us in French, even after we had made it abundantly clear that we do not speak the language. Mostly at the restaurants, where in one particular case it took us around 10 mins just to place our order because the cashier didn't speak english, and when someone came to help her out, she could only speak French and Spanish... which didn't help much. We had to resort to pointing at things on her screen and counting on our fingers to make ourselves understood. We also came across a lot of people who are clearly unhappy working there. Of course this happens everywhere, but somewhere like Disney, unhappy employees tend to stick out a lot. Everything is VERY expensive   which is to be expected, but some things are over priced, even by Disney standards. And some things do feel very cheap. The food is comparatively very expensive too, considering most of it is junk (both because it is junk food and because it isn't even particularly good junk food).If this was our first time there, maybe we wouldn't have been as disappointed. But compared to our first visit, this was definitley a step backwards. Incidentally, we sent our complaints by email on our return home via the website's contact form   we were also disappointed with the hotel we stayed in (Hotel Cheyenne) and, more than 2 weeks later we're still waiting to receive any form of reply, apart from the auto responder. We're not expecting anything to be honest, but a simple acknowledgement and, dare we say it, a small apology (gasp!) that things aren't as magical as promised in all their communication wouldn't be amiss.",Disneyland_Paris
179960012,4,2013-10,Colombia,"It is a good option to hsare with your kids, however, I recommend the other park (the french one) in the city if you visit Paris, could be more interesting with french style. By the other side, it is expensive, not enough atractions and most of the time were under maintenance or closed due to  technical situations . Restaurant options inside the park are limited and bad quality, ( bad taste and Ex. Hamburgers were cold).Shops are crowded and better options in the ouside shop.",Disneyland_Paris

Disney Studios next door which is included was brilliant too, really good theme throughout and fun rides. Tower of Terror by far the best ride. The biggest let down by far was food, very limited choice and costs alot. Nothing for Vegetarians at all and long queues for food. Water fountains very few and far between. We stayed in our campervan in their car park overnight with loads of other vans, toilets open all night but a bit of a walk, cost 30 Euros to park overnight but cheaper than surrounding campsites though its just a car park.",Disneyland_Paris

Between us we managed just about every ride although we were disappointed that Its a Small World was closed for renovation. The little ones loved the teacups ride, Dumbo and the carousel. Our grandaughter aged 3 was thrilled to meet the Disney Princesses especially Snow White and Cinderella. She also enjoyed riding up Main Street on the horse and carriage and back again in the old car. Grandad loved the white knuckle rides Space Mountain, Indiana Jones and Big Thunder Mountain. We ate at the deli on Main Street as the food was good there with lovely cakes! On most of the rides there was hardly any queueing and the longest we waited was 10 minutes. The Star Tours ride is now looking rather old fashioned but we still enjoyed it.",Disneyland_Paris
179882248,5,2013-9,Australia,We visited Disneyland and had an absolutely fantastic time. The park was as we expected and the kids had a ball. Queue times were really good and I don't think we waited more than 20minutes for any ride (we visited mid week). The rides were excellent and getting around was pretty easy. Food prices were no different to any theme park around the world. Getting to the park was very easy and you could easily travel from Paris each day if you really wanted as the train station is literally at the front gate and only takes about 1 hour or so from Gare Lyon.The park was everything we had imagined and hoped for so definitely worth the visit if you are in Paris.,Disneyland_Paris

Longest wait time we had was 15 mins and many rides were less than 5 mins.Big change from Anaheim! I expect it would be busier on weekends as it was mon to thurs.The downside was several food outlets were closed which left less choice but let's face it, you don't go to Disney for food! Yes food was expensive and not great but that seems to be Europe. Didn't have the atmosphere of California but we found some rides were better, big thunder railroad, haunted mansion, space mountain all brill!

179725203,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,"We visited Disneyland for 3 days from the 26th September 2013. We had a really good time with our 3 year old. The weather was hot and for all 3 days we were able to enjoy the park without all the pushing and shoving we expected. As we went mid week it wasn't as busy as we had anticipated. Our daughter loved it and was certainly not too small for this experience at all.We found the queues to be moderate but on most of the rides were given the opportunity to go straight through and enjoy the ride with our whole party due to a disability pass. I was worried that the member of our party with the disability would not be able to experience most of the rides due to her wheelchair but most brilliantly she was accommodated on all but 1 occasion (Peter pans flight due to height and evacuation risk). This was excellent as it meant we could all share in my daughters 1st experience of Disneyland and made our trip even better and certainly a lot less stressful.We saw lots of characters during our visit walking around the park posing for photos and giving autographs including Mickey and Minnie, Buz, Mr Smee, Jack Sparrow (whom was very funny walking along like a crazy drunk) Winnie the Poo, Tigger, Chip & Dale, Goofy and Donald. We did not however see any princes's which would have been lovely. Having said that we saw them all during the parade and the main characters again on the celebration train. The Dreams show was the highlight of our trip, it was truly magnificent from start to finish and I only wish could see it again. We also went to see the Animaguque show wich was wonderful and my daughter found the floating fish and bubbles to be a brilliant addition.This trip was amazing , the food, the shows ( we also did Buffalo Bills ) the cast members, the characters, the music. It all made for a brilliant family holiday. The park itself is kept spotless and their are plenty of toilets providing you make the most of them when you see them. As for restaurants Disney village is the best place to go, they have everything to suite every taste and budget. I would recommend the Rainfirest caffe as this again was great fun. I found the cost of things here to be as expected, expensive!! we had done extensive homework before we went and knew that we needed to be prepared to pay over the odds but just seeing my daughters face was worth every penny and we all work hard so why not enjoy it as much as you can. Be prepared to come away with blisters on blisters, and singing  Magic Everywhere  over and over again lol.Would we go again ? Yes because we had a magical time and having been once before whilst at school it still hasn't lost any of it's charm, infact it's got even better. I would recommend you plan your days before you go and make use of all the forums in order to get as much information as possible. This really helped us and as a result we hardly missed anything that was suitable for our daughter. Brilliant holiday thankyou Disney!",Disneyland_Paris

If they had told us this up front we could have had a bit more of a lie in.The food is such a let down. I appreciate they have a large number of people to feed through out the day, however they couldn't seen to get it right. We were either given the wrong food or by the time it was all ready, half of it was cold. It really does feel like a cattle market, which is a shame as the standards are better over in Florida.

179343268,2,2013-9,Austria,"As a lifelong Disney fan living in Europe, I was excited to bring my kids to Disneyland Paris to see another of the Magical Kingdoms. Boy, was that a mistake. We got (almost) none of the Disney magic with all of the expense! Now, for the sake of full disclosure, my family visited Disneyland in California in July 2012, so that memory is still very fresh and may have tainted our view of the Paris park. That being said, the Paris park was basically the same price so we expected the same experience!PROS:  The closing light show Fireworks show was AMAZING. Worth staying to watch. We watched it every night we were there, we enjoyed it so much.  The food in the park is not THAT bad or overly priced. About the same quality and cost as the Disney parks in the U.S.  The lines were no worse than expected and most rides did have entertaining waiting areas. Fast Pass was really helpful with the more popular rides. Disney also has a  parent swap  option for parent of small children to take turns waiting in line and then bring a parent pass to the waiting parent so they can ride without waiting in line again. This option was nice when the cast member working the ride actually bothered to fetch us a pass when we asked for it.  Space Mountain 2 is way better than the original. We rode it every day, usually at least twice.CONS:  Disney Details! There were none! The grass was dying, the shrubbery was overgrown, the sidewalks were cracked, the bathrooms were dirty, the rides looked run down, and the staff was RUDE.  Ride maintenance. Rides were breaking down constantly, or closing with no warning. Both the Tower of Terror and the Rockin Roller Coaster broke down on the same day, after we had waited in lines for both of them. Not attempt made by Disney cast members to make up for the hours we spent waiting before the ride broke down, not a fast pass for when the ride was working again, not even a free bottle of water to make up for the inconvenience. The Haunted Mansion also broke down while we were there, as did Space Mountain, and Star Tours, and several other rides in the three days that we were there.  Character meet and greet. My husband used our Magical Hours one morning in the park to wait in line for a pass for our daughter to meet Princesses at the Princess Pavilion. He waited in line for about an hour and forty minutes and we were given a pass to meet ONE PRINCESS. Last summer, we waited nearly an hour for at the Princess Pavilion in California, but our daughter got a meet and greet with THREE princesses and then there were three additional princesses (with their princes) at the end of the pavilion doing group meet and greets! Otherwise, we did not see ANY characters walking around the park or doing meet and greets outside of paid meals, and the few post parade meet and greets were so chaotic, I was actually a little worried for Minnie's life. She was being mobbed by about 100 people with only 2 Disney cast members to control the crowd and no line to speak of at all.   Disney Cast members. Rude is not a strong enough word to describe cast members here. Some were even downright offensive! Not what I came expecting with a Disney experience. There were several instances were the cast member simply refused to do their job, for example, the Disneyland Paris Website advertises the Parent Swap service. All rides were supposed to offer it. Many rides did, no problem. But cast members at several of the rides, especially the ones with longer lines, would tell me or my husband to ask for the pass at the exit and then when we got to the exit, they would tell us we should have gotten the pass at the entrance and then walk away. No effort to remedy this. Also, staff members at the Rocket Cafe went beyond rude and lazy and right into offensive when I pointed out that the food delivered to us was not what we ordered and asked for either the correct order or a refund. The cashier then proceeded to disparage me, and Americans in general, in French to the next customer. Until I informed her that I speak French, then she did not even have the sense of shame to apologize for her behavior.   Ride and attraction closures. I understand that closures happen and rides and attractions need to be closed on occasion for maintenance or staffing issues, so I checked the Disneyland Paris website before I visited so I could prepare my kids for which rides they would not be able to ride. According to the website, a few attractions were closed, but most everything should have been open. The following were closed during the duration of our visit:     Pizza Planet   the Petite Train   the Storybook Boats   Pocahontas Indian Village   Haunted Mansion (it was open for a few hours on Saturday, but closed for the most part)   Studio Tram Tour",Disneyland_Paris

Everything seemed very clean and taken care of, the parade was fantastic for the little ones and the light show at the end of the night was fantastic.Only complaint is apart from the guys in character and also where we ate at the Wild West barn, those guys were happy, all the other staff need to smile or at least pretend they enjoy their jobs. I was expecting Disney as in that Disney happiness but that wasn't what you received, it didn't have that friendly face you'd expect from Disneyland.",Disneyland_Paris
179216366,5,2012-10,United States,"I visited in the beginning of October and was thrilled by the pumpkins and other Halloween decorations that were all through the park. Not being to any other park other than those found in Walt Disney World i was in total shock but was like a child again in experiencing Disney for the first time all over again as this was new, exciting and completely different. I loved that some attractions were similar to what i knew back home but had their own spin on it like space mountain, phantom manor and star tours. The food was amazing all through the park and the fireworks for the 20th anniversary were just stunning in every aspect and are simply unforgettable.",Disneyland_Paris
179196683,2,2013-9,Australia,"This is our first experience with any Disneyland and what a huge let down.The place was dirty, smokers everywhere around the children, the place is clearly for children, long waits for rides, lots of rides and spaces closed. Over half the eaters closed for unknown reason. Staff in ALL shops seem very unhappy for the 'happiest place on earth'.There is so much old heritage in Paris and I'm disappointed I wasted a day looking at Disneyland when I could of spent my time in Paris better.",Disneyland_Paris
179181646,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,"Just returned from Disneyland Paris after a five day trip.The Disneyland park is superb.Prices for food and drink are not that bad.A burger or hotdog meal with fries and a drink are approx.   10 per person , half that for kids meals.As you arrive at the park you enter from the car parks through the train station with Disney village to your left ,Disney studios in front of you and Disneyland park to your right ,all within 5 minutes walk of each other,its much smaller than Disney world Florida,so easy on the legs.10r 2 rides are in need of a upgrade but the parades and Disney magic are out of this world.My 2 granddaughters aged 3 and a half and 2 had lots of rides that they could go on and for the older ones the rollercoasters are great.Waiting times for the rides are long at the weekend but next to no waiting on most rides through the week,the longest wait time we experienced Monday to Thursday was 30 minutes.Beer prices in the Disney village were less than 5 euros a pint, nothing like the horror prices I read about before going.Stay in a Disney hotel and take advantage of early park entry at 8 am till 10 am,the deals Disney do on hotel ,parking and tickets are cheaper than buying just your park tickets.It really is magical",Disneyland_Paris
179171492,3,2013-9,United Kingdom,"There is no comparison between Disneyworld, Orlando and Disneyland Park, Paris! The staff look unmotivated, sombre, and just doing a job. It is obvious they couldn't care less if you had a good experience or not. Completely opposite to Disneyworld, Florida! The food and drinks were so expensive in the park and disney village. One beer cost just under 8 euros and coca cola just under 4! In Walt disney park studios had to queue for one and half hours for a luke warm mediocre burger because rest of the food places were closed. Is this due to cut backs? Do not go on weekends as queues for popular rides were on average 60 100 minutes. Fastpass were only available on 3 rides!The disney parades were lacking enthusiasm and had limited interaction with the crowd. Even the characters looked dated and dowdy.Unfortunately smoking is allowed in the park with cigarette butts all over the place. Empty drink bottles floating in the water on its a small world ride. We love disney but this was just another theme park! Walt would turn in his grave...",Disneyland_Paris

179076866,1,2013-9,United States,"I wonder if Disney corporation is name only as nothing like 2 other parks. Filthy, allows smoking, and butts cover the ground. Cups, food left laying where people put down, rotten wood, terrible need of paint all around. Florida park has workers designated to do nothing but walk around and pick up trash. CA park older but clean. Paris park is filthy, dirty, and rides are poorly run. Needs major overhaul in loading procedures. Problem is as long as park makes money, no one will do anything.",Disneyland_Paris
179028334,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,"We have just spent four days and three nights at Euro Disney and it was truly magical, we drove to Ebsfleet and caught the Euro tunnel straight to the park. Our luggage was taken to our hotel Cheyenne and our park tickets and half board vouchers were given to us on the train, on arrival we went straight in to the park.The only gripe was that we had one child 5 years and one child 2 years, we were given a food voucher for 5 year old but not 2 year old. We went to Annette's diner for evening meal but the only option for up to 3 year old child is a jar of baby food which was no good for our 2 year old hungry child so even though we had already paid for the half board experience we had to pay 13 euros for 2 year old mealThe only way to get food for 2 year old is to go buffet which we didAlso a must is Buffalo Bill as pay extra on top of half board voucher, an excellent evening outWe saw all of the parades and the light experience in the evening truly magicalSome rides you had to queue but to be expected, defiantly go on Buzz light year and small worldTake a bike lock with you if you take your own pushchair but you can hire them at the parksAll the family of 5 adults and 2 children had a fantastic time and cant see what people have to complain about, well worth the money :)",Disneyland_Paris
178999666,4,2013-9,United States,"I have been to Disney world in Florida 32 times in 31 years. My husband and I got married there 9 years ago. To say I'm a disney pro is an understatement. For my most recent trip to Paris I asked my husband if he wanted to got to Versailles or Disneyland Paris he opted for Disneyland!  Nuts and bolts  If you are heading to Disneyland for a day trip from Paris (my husband and I did this and it was enough time) it is very easy to get there by train. It is a 35 minute ride directly from the chatelet  les halle station. You will need to get a ticket separate from the intercity ticket. When you purchase your metro tickets tell them you need one for the RER to Disney. Its about 7 euro. Try to purchase your park tickets in advance, you can print them out at home and you will save about 10 euro by not buying at the gate. Our tickets were good for 6 months from the time of purchase which was great because it gives you flexibility depending on weather etc.  This park packs a lot of character into a small space. I have to say that i love the castle at this park. You can walk upstairs in the castle and go below to see the dragon. We were there in September so we didn't wait more than 10 min for any ride. We covered the whole park in three hours. Highlights for me were Big Thunder Mountain, I like how it went under water and had its own island in the lagoon, Casey juniors train and the Story book ride (both of which are at Disneyland in California but not in FL) and my husband liked Space Mountain because it went upside down.  The park needs some refurbishment. Railings need paint and rides need to be updated. It makes me appreciate why every time I go to WDW there is at least one ride closed for updating. If you are a disney fan like myself or have kids and are headed to Paris I would recommend a day trip to Disneyland Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
178980976,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,We came here for 5 days and loved every minute of it. All these people moaning about it looking shabby I mean REALLY! The whole experience was magical particularly fir my son as it was his first time. The rides were good the parades were fantastic and the castle was beautiful. If I had one criticism it would be the fact that there is no queuing system when the characters are around. My child missed out a lot dye to people pushing and that was just the adults. All in all this place has not lost its magic from when I was here 11 years ago. I still turned into a big kid!,Disneyland_Paris

It was our sixth time, last time in 2006. Only one new attraction al the rest is still the same. We missed the magic feeling, the staff don't smile that much any more...

178937827,2,2013-9,United Kingdom,The park was Disney but it lacked excitement and sparkle of the Florida park. The rides and attractions looks tired and although the staff tried at times to be charismatic they failed miserably. The souvenirs were very expensive. The food was expensive too.Out side the park the Disney hotels restaurants were packed and the priority in some queues went to same language guests rather than who was next. The train around the lake from hotel to park was 2 euro each. Theses transports are free in USA!On the positive side my granddaughter enjoyed it as she's too young to know the magic was slightly faded! The lazier show at the end of the day was amazing and the best thing about the park,Disneyland_Paris
178911221,4,2013-9,United Kingdom,"My friend and I (we are both in our mid to late 20s) have visited Disneyland Paris three times in the past 3 years.. The magic of this place is still going strong! I love the way it's laid out and decorated   it's so lovely to glance around and see that everyone's smiling and having an amazing time! There are loads of rides to suit everyone.. I'm obsessed with them all! Only negative that we noted is that the 'it's a small world' ride would really benefit from having some work done on it's ceiling to mask the standard grey roof panelling   it really shatters the illusion & the magic when you look up and you are instantly brought back to earth with a bang when you're reminded that you're just floating around a huge warehouse filled with dolls.. Then it starts to take on a creepy feel! Other than that, I didn't feel the rides required updating & reallyenjoyed everything!Food in the park is wildly expensive & avoid the weekends as the queues are a killer! We just returned from our trip there (Tuesday & Wednesday) and the longest we had to queue was probably 20 minutes   that's absolutely nothing!!! Tip: bring good shoes   you'll do a LOT of walking! And I mean a lot... Potentially 8hrs  each day. Rest regularly. You don't want to be crippled with sore feet by the end of the first day.. & you will unless you take good footwear. Such a boring point to end on haha but honestly, it could ruin your experience otherwise!Overall   Disneyland Paris is still mighty magical & i'd definitely go a fourth time!",Disneyland_Paris

We visited this park as newly weds 17 years ago, and there was much more to the main park than we remembered, in addition to the studios which were a nice addition, but if you are not traveling with kids you could skip it. Don't miss the evening show Disney dreams. Sit as close to the castle as possible!The toilets were very dirty most of the time, which was very annoying, considering that this is off season. Food is rather boring. Mainly hamburgers and fries, and after 3 days we really wanted something else.

We stayed at a disney hotel and really appreciated the extra magic hours to get on the rides in fantasyland with no queuing. The parade was amazing, the characters were so friendly and constantly coming up to our daughter   who was absolutely delighted with the extra attention.

We decided it was probably our last family holiday together and that there was enough for two grown children and their parents to enjoy the time together as well enjoying time apart.The park itself although still true to Disney seemed to lack the magic it had the first time we went.Things are starting to look a bit tired and in need of some work.There were many of the bigger attractions closed for renovation which of course made other things busier than normal.As is usual with these places the food was awful, nothing was fresh and very very expensive.We stayed in the New York hotel which looked amazing on first glance but the rooms are looking a bit shabby, the pool really needs up dating and breakfast was a shambles.There seem to be far to many shops selling over priced Disney tat. The entire place is far to commercialised and the holiday feel has gone.Sad, so in answer to my heading......... no, unfortuneately I wouldn't go back",Disneyland_Paris

The first day it had horrendous rain.consequently none of the characters were walking about. Managed to see only 2 . the queues were approx 50 minutes long and the roundabout horses lasted for 3 rotations. Kids only on and then had to get off. Cost of tickets for all of us was 920 Euros !!! Absolute rip off. We had no idea that there would not be family or group discounts. Also were not advised of any deals on offer. First day was a washout and had to pay 9    for adults and 6    for kids plastic rain covers that ripped before day over. The food was terrible. Expensive and nasty. One venue we waited in queue for 45 minutes because the staff were more interested in chatting to each other than actually focusing on what they were doing. There are some serious management problems in most of them but that doesn't excuse the poor quality food. So main tips are research deals, be prepared for really bad weather, bring as much food and drink as you can to save buying in park, be prepared for long waiting  times. Top tip ....save up and go to Florida.",Disneyland_Paris

At least 3 rides broke down during our 5 day trip, 2 of which we had queued for..shame because I think it's a fantastic place and I wonder why they aren't staffing it properly. I don't think it could possibly be as good as America but I'll have to let you know about that as I'm trying it next year..Overall a great time was had and queuing for the rides for up to an hour really isn't that bad in Disneyland somehow, I think they make the queues pretty fun (plenty to see on way)and they move at a good pace.",Disneyland_Paris
178182237,2,2013-9,United Kingdom,"Went to Disneyland Paris, 4 8 September. All I can say is that whatever price you have budgeted for this holiday, treble it at least and that is how much money you are likely to spend.My advice is save up and go to Florida. The food and drink are way over priced, all the fast food is the same. The Queues are ridiculous, 30 minutes every time you want to buy a drink, 2.59 euros for a small cup of tea.The staff have no idea of what customer service is, for example at Casey's Corner, I wanted 5 teas, Queued for ages to be told they had no milk but I could have hot milk in my tea and then was told I would have to pay for the hot milk on top of the 2.59 for the tea, what a joke, I told them to shove it.The Americans fall over themselves backwards to help,the Disney staff need to get some serious tips on customer service. 95% don't crack a smile and couldn't care less if you enjoy your day or not, as long as you are paying the money that's all they seem bothered about.The Queues for rides are terrible, especially weekends, 120 minutes for the main rides, half the time the fast passes were not working. Every day at least one of the main rides wasn't working.Than goodness we had been there for two days before else would have only managed 3 rides in the day.They let far too many people in for the size of the park and the amount of staff they employ.The pushing in, has to be seen to be believed. The Europeans have no manners at all, I can't believe I had forgotten this fact.Was in one Queue and up to 20 people pushed in before we got to the ride, my daughter spoke to one Spanish family and asked them to go to the back of the queue, only for the father to shout shut up in my daughter's face. Very intimidating and very rude.The staff ignore all the pushing and shoving in the queues, they have no queue management at all.I gave the park two stars for the park itself and the late night show and even that was a bun fight at night. People shoving and pushing to get a position to see the castle. On the Saturday night, a bunch of French teens were throwing their rubbish at an English couple standing at the front and kept shouting out are you English and even though French staff were standing around the edge, they did nothing. This was the same every evening, as every night there were nearly fights amongst the crowd but staff always turned a blind eye.Six of us went to Disneyland Paris and none of us will go back.

178171992,3,2013-9,United Kingdom,"My husband and I have been to Disney several times (6 or 7) over the past 20 years. Having just got back from our most recent trip we can honestly say we won't be rushing back anytime soon. The prices was extortionate   we paid   5 for a small coke and   7 for a small glass of wine. I normally buy gifts for friends and family but the cheapest t shirt we saw was   10 for kids sizes   up to   35 for adults, and they didn't seem to be the best quality. Even small key rings   sweets   pencils etc were   3     5 each. Luckily we had meal vouchers included with our package or we may have been bankrupt by the time we got home. The rides are still good, but it seems like the management were caught off guard with the good weather and the queues were horrendous on most of the popular rides. We only managed to Fast Pass once as the suggested times were nearly always 2 hours off and we didn't want to hang around. Any rides we did get on were running at low capacity hence the rides were kept loner than they had to be. We did have a good time   both knackered now, but feel ripped off and didn't have as good a time as we have on previous occasions.

Do not be put off by all the negative reviews about the park or the experience people had....we had a fantastic time and not even the rain ruined it!! This was the first holiday me and my OH had taken without parents or siblings being present and it was just our kind of holiday (we are early 20's). We spent 5 days in the parks and made use of magic hours every day to get on the more popular rides in fantasy land, I would definitely recommend you use your magic hours if staying in a Disney hotel. On average the park was busy but not too packed, the only busy day's we had were Wednesday and Thursday, but still the lines for rides were never more than about 10 15 minutes on our visit. They have recently been doing a lot of refurbishments to the park and even we noticed them whilst there, like the painting of the shop fronts along main street, new gates, new flooring e.t.c and in places ugly green fencing was up, however the magic was still very much still there and we tended not to notice most of the time as we were having too much fun!! The parades are magical and we got some lovely video's and pictures of them which we will cherish forever, we are adults and we loved it...so I can just imagine how it would be in a child's eyes, talking of parades and shows the dreams night time show is phenomenal and such a breathtaking thing to watch, I watched the first time with my jaw dropped at the pure wonder of it, however people start arriving about an hour early to get the best spots, so that's what I would definitely recommend anyone doing as the wait is certainly worth it. The shops throughout Disney have pretty much the same souvenirs and merchandise which gets a bit boring after a while, but still the shops sell a wide range of products for all ages, my favorite buy of the holiday had to be my Tigger jumper from the world of Disney shop. I will definitely be returning here especially when the Lego shop is open, hopefully in the very near future",Disneyland_Paris

Not many people speak english, but night bus are avilable should you need it. Although, we didnt get to where we want to go, the only available one was a stop half and hour walk away.

A few tips if you're planning a visit: Make sure to utilize fastpasses and if you're staying at the resort the extra magic hours are great to get in some rides while it's a bit less crowded; Beware of pickpockets, I would wait til the end of the day to make most purchases of souvenirs or if you're staying on property, have the items delivered to your hotel, this way there's no chance of people grabbing your bags; Plan out your days at the parks in advance, go online and look at the park map to find the definite must do attractions for everyone in the family, that way you don't miss out on something you were hoping to see (it also helps you learn the lay of the land so getting around is a little easier); And most importantly, make sure you have comfortable shoes to wear! There's a lot of walking (and standing) so you want to make sure you're comfortable and don't end up with blisters or sore feet!",Disneyland_Paris
177879331,3,2013-2,United Kingdom,This was good but when we went there were very little characters about and having been to the one in Florida it was a bit of a let down but for people who can't afford the Florida one for children it was really fun and brought back some good memories. Also if you are a student take your n u s card as you then get in cheaper than the children.,Disneyland_Paris
177851951,5,2013-9,Australia,Our visit to Disneyland Paris was excellent. Enjoyed ourselves on all of the rides. Park was busy but not too packed on the day we were there. Lines for rides were never more than about 15 minutes on our visit.Enjoyed the Disney Dreams show at closing time.,Disneyland_Paris
177803098,4,2012-10,Canada,"My husband and I live in Florida, and are avid fans of the Disney brand. We decided to visit Disneyland Paris and Hollywood Studios, and had a great day! With that said, we went with a few key points: 1. There is no comparison to Disney World   therefore, do NOT expect the same variety at any other park. 2. We went in late September   we practically had the entire park to ourselves! No ride was more than a five minute wait...3. People complain about cost at Disney   just go with the understanding that it will not be a cheap day. If you fret over ever nickel spent, you wil never enjoy yourselfBy the end of the day we had a great time, and enjoyed a few rides better than Orlando. Space Mountain 2 was WAY better than the original!! We immediately got off and rode it again. Also, the was a Nemo ride in Hollywood studios that truly took us by surprise...again, we had to ride it immediately a second timeI would recommend Disneyland Paris ONLY if you have an extra day near Paris that you need to make plans for, and if you are truly a Disney lover.",Disneyland_Paris
177802708,4,2013-9,Australia,"Great experience and rides for little kids butthe number of retail outlets is overwhelming   if it rains there's not much to do apart from shop and queue for the shows. Food inside the park is appauling with massive queues, horrendous prices and bad, tatty seating areas.",Disneyland_Paris
177763432,4,2013-9,United States,"As the title says, we still enjoy coming here. We have been many times since the opening 20 years ago. Good rides and if you can avoid the major holiday period and weekends, then the queue are not bad at all. It could have been cleaner and a few minor repairs are needed here and there. This year we were lucky to watch the special birthday fireworks in the evening and it was really good, worth staying for (at 21:00). My only main issue is the organisation around the Disney characters walking around in the park. I realise there is a major time issue involved here but there is no queuing system at all. The staff accompanying the characters, are really not helpful. Each time we are here the kids are disappointed as people always sneak in front for autographs and pictures. When it is finally their turn, the character has to leave!!! 3 years ago we went to Disney World in Orlando, and they handled this so much better. They should really have a look at how it is done over there, as it is so much better and causes no problems to anyone, unlike in Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
177758410,2,2013-5,Australia,"This was probably the biggest dissapointment in our 3 month tour of Europe. We had been expecting it to the highlight and a once in lifetime experience for our 4 kids and for us adults who had to pay for it. Where to start, whilst we did not pay before hand and thus missed out on various discounts, we did enquire as to what a 3 day 2 park pass would be for 6 and we quoted at the entrance gate approx 750 euros or so. Next day when we went to pay it was close to 800 euros for 2 day 2 park pass. Once we got inside, the several of the most famous rides were out of order with no notice of at the gate, the ones that were running had queues of 1 2 hours (this was off season). The food was a joke in fact it was so expensive for glorified McDonalds meals we had to laugh as we invaribly paid (no food allowed in), think 70 euros for meal for 6.The smaller world (stunt show is excellent) was actually better and I will admit that we enjoyed ourselves there, but the queues, breakdowns and expense mean that it was a real let down overall. We did get one benefit, we got so used to being feelong conned by the whole experience that we now have a new family phrase to describe those moments when you have royally done over  You've been Disneyed .",Disneyland_Paris
177748338,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,"I have been the biggest Disney fan since I can remember, but i have never been lucky enough to go. For my 24th birthday my boyfriend took me here and i was blown away. After reading loads of negative reviews on the park, I was very pleasantly surprised. The queues were not ridiculously long and definitely shorter than you would get in Alton Towers! We went on two days (Sunday and Monday) Mondays queues were A LOT shorter with the most we queued up for a ride was 15 minutes. We managed to go on all the rides numerous times! The food in the park is not as bad as people make out! It is mainly fast food but we were prepared for that. Its expensive but so is the whole of Paris!   10 is a lot for hotdog, fries and a drink but they were pretty big portions. My boyfriend has been to Florida numerous times and he said that Eurodisney was no where near as bad as he thought and he thoroughly enjoyed the trip and he said that its pretty spot on. The park was pretty much spotless with no litter in site. The parade was great fun and the Disney Dreams show was incredible. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.",Disneyland_Paris
177661010,3,2013-9,Australia,"We took the kids to Disneyland Paris as part of a holiday to France. It's expensive. Mind bogglingly so. They know how to squeeze a Euro out of you for everything   so be prepared. We had a good time. It was fun. The rides are not much compared to the US versions. There is one adult exciting ride. It's really for smaller kids. A tip, if you can, is to stay in one of the hotels. That was you get 2 hours in the park before the gates open to the venal public which is helpful.Be prepared that at the hotel you will pay for anything additional that normally you would get as part of your hotel stay. There are no tea making facilities in the room, wi fi will cost you, if it rains, ponchos will cost you    9 Euros each.Food is terrible inside the park and expensive. If you can, take prepared sandwiches, crackers, cheese, anything so you can avoid hot dogs, average pizza, curly fries, popcorn etc. We went in September. Probably a better time to go. Queues for rides were not bad. Be prepared for rain though. Handiest hints I can think of.Take as much decent food as you can. A raincoat. Stay at a hotel for the 2 hours before the gates open. If you do that, when you arrive go straight to the hotel on the shuttle buses, check in and make a dinner reservation at your hotel for dinner. Do each of the lands systematically. It's a hell of a lot of walking for kids and exhausting. Agree with your kids what they can have from the shops before you go, there are shops everywhere. Be in the park at 8am on your second day and get to the rides which you noticed had the longest queues the day before before the gates open to the public. On the second day if you have overnight luggage to store, store in the train station where there are huge lockers, so a) you don't have to drag them into the park b) wait in a long and inefficient line to concierge them and c) it's half the price to store them at the train station.",Disneyland_Paris
177629441,1,2013-9,United Kingdom,Expect to queue anything from 40 to 80 minutes for the ride. 1 fast pass available at a time with long queues even for them.  Only managed to go on 4 rides all day.,Disneyland_Paris
177618537,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,This is the second time we have visited Disneyland in Paris and we were disappointed on both occasions. The park is dirty and not very well kept. We queued for over an hour on 3 separate rides when they had a mechanical fault so were turned away from the rides. When you only have one day here 3 hours out of that day is a lot when you have disappointed children with you. The place is expensive and very crowded. The highlight was the 20th Anniversary Firework and Laser Display at the end of the evening which was well worth the wait. The pushing and shoving on the other hand was not very good with people ramming you with bags and buggies   no consideration for their fellow disneyland people.,Disneyland_Paris
177505790,3,2013-9,United Kingdom,"We visited for my daughter's 7th birthday weekend and the excitement levels reached fever pitch when she met Minnie at hotel check in.Most of the rides had very long queues and I like the fast pass idea but not the fact that you can only apply one at a time....it's crazy when you might be waiting for 4 hours. Queing was generally slow especially in the rain soaked Saturday. Buzz Lightyear said 50 mins and we waited 85 mins.On Saturday Pirates of the Caribean broke down when we neared the front, the same happened for truck mountain so we decided to go back first thing Sunday.....and guess what got near the front of truck mountain and it broke down again!!!! A very disappointed birthday girl (and dad!) The monotony of queuing is one thing, but to have no joy at the end is very frustrating. Space Mountain was great and Peter Pan was a fun ride too for the kids.My daughter loved the character encounters, to see her so excited made it all worth while. The parades are great and the evening Peter Pan show is amazing.Bring plenty of euros.....35 40 euros for (not very) fast food burger and chips x3   ouch! Food quality over all pretty poor and like everything expect to queue!Even with all the negatives, would we go back? Ask my 7 year old and it would be a resounding yes!",Disneyland_Paris
177498780,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,"Just back from stay in Disneyland hotel in party of 5 adults and 2 small children. Hotel excellent, Inventions buffet with characters superb. Dinner with Cinderella etc on Saturday night the highlight of my granddaughters trip..Staff all very helpful in hotel and park, it took 5 minutes to organise a disabled pass for my son on Sunday when park very busy, only required concession bus pass.Only low point was VEA transport to and from airport. waited 25min for bus arrival then another 40 min while drivers crammed as many people and suitcases as possible onto bus. then another hour transfer, not ideal with two tired children, advise looking for alternatives. Reminded me why I stopped booking package holidays..Otherwise a great weekend but will go midweek another time to avoid queues.",Disneyland_Paris
177493691,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Disneyland Paris is a mixed bag, on the one hand   it's Disneyland!   on the other hand, Disney hasn't been able to better the resentful 'typically French' service ethic of its employees much. I'm sure that there are polite, helpful, pleasant and smiling types among Disneyland Paris cast members; the ones that I met were without exception rude, unhelpful, unpleasant and scowling. You don't pay three hundred quid in entrance fees to expose your family to that for a day, do you? The bathrooms were filthy as well. Unless you live close enough to drive there and back, it isn't much less expensive than going to Disneyworld, which is a much nicer experience.",Disneyland_Paris
177478268,2,2013-8,Australia,"Our entire trip was planned around visiting Disneyland and luckily we did enough other great things on our holiday for this not to ruin it.Where do I start.. Don't get there early if you are not staying at the park (Don't stay at the park   the prices are absolutely INSANE!) as there is nothing magical about Disneyland before opening time. Queues and grumpy staff greeted us on our much anticipated arrival. When it finally opened the queues were unbelievable on everything.. we expected this but NONE of the rides justified the wait time. Some of the rides we took our young children on were laughable at the state of them. We went on a slow boat ride around all the different nursery stories and there was rubbish in the water, paint peeling off and just things that looked like they hadn't been touched in 20 years.Many of the things that make made Disney so magical years ago when I went just don't happen here. None of the characters walk around so you guessed it.. another queue. 1.5 hours to meet Mickey and just over 2 hours to meet a princess. We had to queue to get a ticket to queue again for the Princess! Finally made it to meet her and the photographers camera was busted and didn't work so no souvenir photo just one off mine where the flash played up!So close to 4 hours and we'd met two characters. Some below average overpriced food and a crazy 2 hour queue for thundermountain (don't queue in this if you are claustrophobic) and we were well and truly over the place.Look, I could handle the queues (I expected them) if the park was inviting and clean and had a bit of magic but it was none of these. All we thought at the time is that it was trading off its reputation of years ago while not spending a cent. Wish we'd save the huge amount of money we'd spent on tickets. Think long and hard about visiting and lower your expectations!",Disneyland_Paris
177458107,5,2012-12,Malaysia,"Visited Disneyland Paris in Dec 2012 with our 3 kids and my elderly mother. We felt like kids again ....playing with the rides...walking around admiring the beautiful Cinderella Castle, gardens, disney parks. The queue for rides was less than 5 minutes for all rides. Good to visig early December since less crowd.The weather was manageable with good layers of clothing. The shows was very good for kids too. We had Fast Pass and used once only since no queue. The rides was good for all ages...both adults and kids. Fun rides.The parades with characters was admirable and the firework during closing was fabulous. We saw it everynight during our stay there. It was the 20th anniversary of Paris Disneyland and so the decor with christmas in mind was sooo beautiful. My kids loved disney. We snapped photos with Snow White...worth waiting to see her. Also with Captain Jack Sparrow of Pirates of Carribean.The half board meal at the mediterranean restaurant was our favourite....delicious kebab, tasty fried chicken ...yummy.Great disneyland visit for all of us. A must visit for Disney fans. We took 3 full days to cover the entire Disney Park. Such a memorable visit a feeling being kids again. A dream come true indeed.",Disneyland_Paris

177283547,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Literally I became a kid again. A 16 year old, running amongst Disney characters, getting their autographs, and collecting all the cuddly toys they can is not a sight seen often, but in Disneyland it was surprisingly common. And I was one of them. It's amazing. The rides are great. I recommend Thundermountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain and Buzz Lightyear rides. The characters are so friendly and so in character. For instance, the actor here was a better Bert than Dick Van Dyke himself (though that doesn't take too much!!!). The fast pass system is brilliant and also well hidden   no extra costs just get in line, scan your ticket and you have an allotted time (you can only have one at a time). The queues are long but that's expected. IT'S DISNEYLAND!!!The light show is thoroughly recommended. However, I did not get to see it all as it bucketed it down from about midway. And I am not underestimating the rain (I'm English, I'm used to the rain!). We were soaked to the bone in seconds. We stayed for as long as we could but we got too wet.The character parade is worth a watch for the kids (and over excited adults...).The restaurants are a waste of time   expensive and not great food.The shops are also expensive but that's not going to change.The popcorn is expensive but so worth a box. I went when it was 35 degrees C so we spent a lot of money on ice cream... It was 3.50 Euros a pot.Overall it was the most amazing experience of my life so far. It was so much fun and so cute and I met Jack Sparrow. It was great. I was the back of a long queue of middle aged women.........It's expensive but it was worth it! I had a great time, my siblings had a great time, my parent had a great time. It was amazing for the whole family.",Disneyland_Paris

177210768,2,2013-9,United Kingdom,"...well that title was a little melodramatic, but you get what I mean. Disney, being Disney, was magical, and I will brave lines and weather and fast food at daylight robbery prices to experience the magic again and again. What I did not expect to have to brave in this children's park were clouds upon clouds of second hand smoke. I will not expound upon the magic of Disney   it would have be wonderful sans fumes. But everywhere we went, we were surrounded by smoke   there was no escape. Even coming from Paris, which has more smokers on the streets (and in restaurants) than many other cities in the world, this was indescribable   there were times when I was literally gagging on the smoke and I just could not find reprieve. I had asthma as a child but have not had an attack in over 15 years, but I thought I was going to have one on the day, and I had breathing difficulties for many days after I returned home. If you are planning to bring your young child here   please spare a thought for their health. My heart goes out to the little ones who sit there in their strollers breathing in the smoke unable to complain. The worst is when the whole park settles in front of the castle to wait for Disney Dreams   everyone starts lighting up and the smoke just thickens. If possible, take your kids to the parks in Florida or California   it would be a much more authentic experience (the French staff are nowhere near as bright and cheery as the Americans) and healthier one too.",Disneyland_Paris
177200022,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,"We were here for a few days in September and absolutely loved it. We are two adults who have been to Disney as youngsters but I think it's still magic enough to keep you entertained as adults. It's not the same as Orlando but still good. Queues were reasonable for the rides the longest being the runaway train at 45 minutes, they do have fast pass on this though. Frontierland was fantastic the runaway train never fails to disappoint. The haunted mansion was still as scary! Adventureland was good the queue for pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones was really short (we rode them both twice) and explored the caves and paths there too. Discoveryland was good, we loved the new buzz light year ride where you travel round shooting the zorbs. We went there during the extra magic hours as we were staying in a Disney hotel and the queue was only 15 minutes and fast moving. I think this one got pretty busy later on in the day. We went on space mountain three times as the queues were so short, the other rides, Autopia and spinning thing were longer queues in the baking heat and probably worth it if you have young children but I wouldn't bother with them if I went back. Fantasyland was magical, we explored the castle and the wait times for all the rides were low. Peter Pan's flight was closed which was a bit disappointing but I'm sure we'll be back. The only negatives I have about the park are that there were a number of people smoking, some of the toilets were very dirty and not well kept (especially in fantasyland) and the queues to get anything to eat were atrocious! Worse than waiting for the rides! We went to the marionette restaurant for a  quick  lunch and at least 45 minutes later we were served. I don't know that the staff in the place have fully embraced the concept of fast food and I'm not sure what took so long as all they were doing was placing ready made items onto trays. There seemed to be a lot of eateries closed (toad hall, buzz light years pizza place) not sure if it was just because it was the off season. If they had been open it might have cut wait times. The closing show was something else, it was the special for the 20 year anniversary and included scenes from Disney movies were projected onto the castle and fireworks. Really good and worth hanging around for. People were a bit rude and pushy and blocked others view so arrive early for a good spot. Would recommend and would definitely go back and visit again.",Disneyland_Paris
177151538,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Visited with my wife and 10 year old GrandsonThis was his treat since he had never been on an aeroplane, never stayed in a hotel and never been to a Disney resortAll three experiences were excellent and thoroughly enjoyed by us allThe weather for the 4 day visit was 'Florida' weather with warm sunshine from early morning to late eveningThe Disney resort and Village together with the Sequia Lodge we found to be clean and we were treated politely by the staff we encountered. This however could not be said of the visiting French people who we found to be extremely rude and arrogant. They certainly don't believe in standing in line and waiting there turn to take the rides. They just wait for an opportune moment and jump to the front !It's very expensive in terms of food and drink but thanks to the very comprehensive breakfast put on by the Sequia Lodge Hotel each morning, we were able to eat sufficient to last us till early evening. McDonalds then came to our rescue in the Disney Village and their prices were not much higher than in the UKEating in one of the Disney Villages restaurants was expensive @   52 for three of us and quite frankly the food was awfullOverall we all really enjoyed our time at Disney Paris and the weather certainly helped to give us the Florida feel. However the experience is nowhere as good as Florida with Disney World and Universal Studios with their greater range of attractionsFor a short break however you will definitely get to feel the Disney Magic",Disneyland_Paris

We ate at Silverspur Steak house, no reheated food there twas delicious! Plaza Gardens, which is like a massive buffet we likened it to Taybarns in there, but still good, and Agrabah Cafe, another buffet not to my persona taste though hubby enjoyed it!The parades were great and Disney Dreams is defo the best show we have ever ever seen!

Have stayed at the main hotel, sequoia lodge and the Newport Bay. Each visit has been as special as the one before and will continue to visit for many years to come.",Disneyland_Paris
177003005,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,"We visited Disneyland Paris from 1st   5th September 2013 with our two young children aged 3 years and 9 months   we were fortunate enough to be staying at the Disney's New York Hotel which is a lovely hotel in a fantastic position right at the entrance to Disney Village. As a result park tickets to Disneyland Park and Walt disney Studios were included in the price of our trip. I was a little apprehensive before our visit   whilst my husband has visited the Florida equivalent I have never been to either. I wasn't sure it was my 'scene' nor was I confident my three year old would get much out of the trip. I came to eat my words. Our three year old daughter isn't always the most confident of children but seemed to get completely caught up in the magic. Disneyland park is split into three areas   Fantasyland (what i call the very disney heart of the park) Frontierland (wild west) and discoveryland. by far her favourite was fantasyland. We did the Dumbo ride, Mary Poppins Carousel, Pinnochio, Alice in Wonderland maze, Mad Hatters Tea Cups, its a small world boat ride   and whilst we the adults thoroughly enjoyed disneyland park it is a wonderland experience for the younger child. Even our son at 9 months was in awe being pushed around in his pram and was able to enjoy a few of the activities himself. We visited every morning during our five day stay. We were lucky that our visit co incided with the end of the French school holidays and was during the week not at weekend so it was relatively quiet by disney standards. During the morning even after magic hours expired we didn't queue for more than 10 15 minutes for a ride   sometimes being able to walk straight on   the longest we queues was 40 minutes for dumbo in our first day which was a Sunday afternoon. Definately try to coincide your stay during the week and aim for rides etc in a morning which tend to be quieter than afternoons. Our daughter is princess mad and this was the main reason that inspired our trip   Princess Pavillion is located within Fantasyland   however the queues were ridiculous and even then you were not guaranteed to get a pass to meet a princess. The princesses don't really pop out for meet and greet either so we booked the Auberge de Cendrillion which was fantastic however if you have a Princess mad daughter a TIP is to stand by the benches located in between the Princess Pavillion and Its a Small World Ride   the princesses are on rotation and switch every hour   though they aren't permitted to stop for autographs or photos we saw every single princess this way. They start around 10.30 and change every hour. We got some fantastic photos of them walking to and from the pavillion and our daughter was waved at and blown kisses to by them which made her visit   a happy little girl with no queue or cost!! What more could a parent ask for! We also visited frontier land and did the riverboat cruise which was good. It was of course the extended 20th anniversary celebrations whilst we were there which meant the 20th Celebration Train was passing through the park every day   mickey minnie Donald etc are all aboad and you can follow the train until it stops when the character disembark for autographs and photos. Then there was the main parade at 5pm which was fantastic and included floats of all the main disney films and the staple disney characters such as mickey etc. You need to be getting a spot around an hour before the parade starts but as we were blessed with brilliant weather we would sit on a kerbside eating ice creams which made this feel less of a chore. dont worry you will still see the parade if you dont get there early thats just for the best seats in the house so to speak as it does get very crowded. Corners are the best spot to see the parades. We sat near Casyes Corner on either side of the road and had a fab view. To top our stay off was the Disney Dreams Show   a light projection show at the castle   an absolute must see   we managed to see it several times! A tip for this   a good standing point is between Caseys Corner and the Ice Cream Parlour   its at a perfect height to see the entire castle   don't be fooled into thinking you need to be right at the front for the best spot to view   we actually caught the end of the show on our last night whilst shopping   we were right at the back near the gazebo (near the exit) and we actually were able to make out more details than we had in previous viewings   though admittedly the ambience wasnt as good! So a middle spot is perfect :) Anyone visiting during the 20th celebrations   note that the park operates summer and winter hours. The disney dreams show was previously 11pm and the parades at 730   in September they switched to parade at 5pm and dreams at 9pm   this was much better suited to our small children! Im not going to comment upon the price of things   its all been said before. Its not cheap   we found our biggest expenditure was bottled water as it was so hot   but there are water fountains located in the park so we filled our bottles with this   there are sandwich places which sell meal deals with chips crisps sandwiches and a drink for about    9   which we found served two people adequately. We took in our own sweets and snacks, brought our princess costumes from home   why wouldnt you? Professional photos are    15 each but you can buy 10 for    47   it is possible to economise without penny pinching! I wanted for nothing whilst there and managed not to spend an obscene amount of money. One thing I must comment upon is the cleanliness of the facilities, the streets, toilets, baby change I cannot praise the standards enough! All in all a fabulous place I will visit again! Truely magical :)",Disneyland_Paris
176983679,4,2013-8,India,"A great place, but the amount of people smoking is not funny. Though the park itself is a non smoking area, People are smoking all over the place, In ques, while strolling about. That is really annoying and the cast members seem to overlook the entire thing.We went in August, so the Ques were really long, 50 mins to and 1.5 hours for a ride that is 60 secs is just plain ridiculous. It makes sense planning everything to the last second to take advantage of the fast pass and rides. Food is a tad expensive, sandwiches and baguettes around 4 6 euros, and water (500ml) around 2.5 euros. Though there are water fountains around if you carry your water bottles. The 2 extra magic hours are good for kids if you are staying at one of the disney properties.It makes sense to reserve your lunch dinner tables as that will save you from queuing again.For the 7pm Parade as well as the Disney dreams show at 11pm, you have to get there an hour earlier at least if you want to get good spots.Buying your daughter a princess dress out of the park will save you atleast 40 euros, unfortunately for us we had no choice, and had to shell out 60 euros for one, But the look on their faces when they wear it is priceless.The overall experience was good except for the 2nd hand smoke.",Disneyland_Paris
176900770,1,2013-8,Ireland,"It's no secret that a visit here doesn't come cheap but Disney take the term rip off to a whole new level.

However, having paid    229 for tickets for 3 adults (my 13 year old being an adult according to Disney) and 1 child (   300 at the gate so if you have to go then definitely book in advance) it came as an unpleasant surprise to be charged an additional    15 for parking. Once inside, the overcharging continues   e.g. almost    3 for a small bottle of coke or water.However, none of this is that unexpected but what we didn't expect were the length of the queues for most of the rides. We queued for 50 minutes to an hour for 2 pretty average rides which once you are on them lasted less than a minute. Some of the queues for the popular rides were 70 minutes. There is a fast pass option but it is of very limited use and we only managed to use it once. We then queued for over 30 minutes for Phantom Manor and then spent another 20 minutes stuck in the lift which traumatised my daughter and ruined the rest of the day as she was reluctant to go on any of the other rides. The operator seemed to have no idea of what was going on and when questioned merely responded with  technical problem . The apology when we were eventually released was very token.I have honestly had much better days out at Thorpe Park and Chessington World of Adventures at a fraction of the cost. We emailed Disney with our complaint when we returned home and received an automated response promising that thay would contact us  very soon . More than 2 weeks later we have still not heard from them.",Disneyland_Paris
176896586,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,"Had a fantastic time with brilliant weather which made it. Tried not to compare with Florida but it was very hard. Some of the small rides, eg Snow White and Seven Dwarfs went so fast that the little ones could not take it all in. Lots of rides for little ones so would definitely go back as it is so close,",Disneyland_Paris
176868698,4,2013-8,United States,"It was hard to accept the queuing and the hustle and bustle but in the end we had a magical time with our 6 and 4 year olds. I have already reviewed the Studio area so I won't mention this here. The best bits of the place was the 7pm parade and the 11pm 20th Anniversary light show, both were amazing. For both things I would say to be certain of a good spot you would have to find your place 1.5 hours beforehand, especially for the lightshow since once everyone stands up it's hard for the kids to see. We loved the parade and the music and all the characters really looked like they were enjoying it all the way round.The Runaway Train is the best roller coaster I've been on for a while, and it had a fast pass, still a wait of about 20 30 mins though. The Buzzlightyear ride was fun too.I queued 2 days on the trot to so my kids could have a meeting with a Princess. I queued first for a timed ticket at about 9.10am until 10.30am and then sometimes you have to queue again once inside the Princess parlour. It was nice to see my daughters face when meeting Snow White and Jasmin though.Food and drink is expensive everywhere, take some with you if you can. The mark up on gifts also ridiculus, it's amazing how much people still purchase. Everywhere was very clean and well maintained. Most people could speak English also, which helped sometimes.The magic hours that we were entitled to were a waste of time after the first use, only the Fantasyland was open and then only certain rides.It was a great memorable trip.",Disneyland_Paris
176855957,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,Was nearly as good as the Florida resort. As soon as you walk in you feel the magic. All staff very helpful. The kids absolutely loved it aged 5 and 2. The buses take you from your hotel to the park. Very full and fast but part of the fun. The parades are magnificent. You must watch the evening parade and firework display. Wonderful.,Disneyland_Paris
176822901,5,2013-7,Mauritius,If you have kids you HAVE to take them to Disneyland at least once .   There truly is something for everybody.

What it is with some people, banging in to you, cutting in line (not that they did that more than once !!!!)Stunt show was awesome, espec when McQueen came out that was the best part.My fav ride was RC in the Toy Story bit.Warning about Space Mountain, slams your head and really hurts so be prepared, I personally will never go on it again, not from being scared but just because of the pain.Rockin Roller Coaster was good.I was in heaven in all the shops and they are very sneaky, they will put one type of teddy or t shirt in separate shops so you just have to go in all of them or you may miss something your after. No 'Treasure Planet' stuff which was really disappointing but I did find a 'Mushu' teddy (named my Dog after him so was lots of screaming in the shop when I found him) all the stuff was really expensive so be prepared !!!!Was disappointed that even though you get in 2hrs before everyone else (if you stay at a resort affiliated with the park) there was only a couple rides open and most of those were childrens, makes you wonder what the incentive is???Stayed at Davy Crockett Ranch and the premium lodge was worth the extra money, nice to be out of the resort in the evening away from the crowds WARNING on site shop is VERY expensive.",Disneyland_Paris
176733555,3,2013-9,United Kingdom,"9th visit and how it has gone down hill! Always been expensive but was worth it. Not anymore. Rides always either closed or breaking down. Not the amount of characters there used to be. Staff costumes rubbish in comparison to previous visits. Food is of a mediocre standard with ridiculous prices. Gifts, over priced and not even Disneyland Paris exclusive like they used to be. Over   300 for meal for 5 adults and 2 kids but only 4 different characters, on previous 3 visits to cafe mickey the price was similar but more characters and food of better standard in the past. Disney held a very special place in my family's heart due to many visits with my belated parents, but its just not got it anymore. Go to Alton towers its better value and the rides work!",Disneyland_Paris

176696172,5,2013-7,China,I have been to Florida and California they are bigger but the lines are crazy. I went here with my wife and the longest wait was 20 minutes and that was in the summer on a weekday. We got to go on almost everything. The train does take along time so leave a little early and pack snacks because obviously it's expensive. It was awesome and would go again,Disneyland_Paris
176677854,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,We've been to Disney many times and it was very disappointing the rides broke down so often.

176659718,5,2013-9,Sweden,"This is one of the most beautiful theme park I have visit, it's so well planed and so well maintained. You never see any trash laying around and one day we had a bit of rain and as soon as it stopped the staff was out cleaning away the water pools that had formed at the Main street. The park has a wide range of attractions from thrilling roller coasters to cute and sweet rides thats enjoyable for all ages. The cleanest bath rooms can be found near City Hall, they have always been clean and fresh when I've used them. But the best part for me about this park is the scenery. The parade is fantastic with great details and committed actors. During our stay they still celebrated the 20 anniversary and at the park closing the show Disney Dreams were shown. I saw the show last year already and it was a big part of why I choose to come back again this year. The show is simple amazing, totally magical and one of the best shows I've seen!",Disneyland_Paris

176566672,3,2013-9,United Kingdom,"Overall fairly disappointed with the park. Some areas not well kept. eg. on exiting it's a small world the lawned areas had not been cut and full of weeds. ( just an observation) The days we were there the parks felt almost over crowded. In the Studios in particular many of the eating places were closed. There were long queues even for the ladies toilets. In the men's toilets there were at least 6 ladies in front of me in line to use them. Most of the toilets I used were dreadful and not being maintained. ( have seen better standards in porta loos at a pop festival !!We queued for ages even for some of the smallest of rides for the young children 30   40 minfor a 90 second roundabout ride. Most of the larger rides were at least an hour and a half.Even 10 min. after the official opening time there was a 2 hour wait for the tower of terror.We made the most of our time, but it was not the magical experience we had hoped for our two young grand children's first Disney visit. Unlike our first visit with our own daughter to Florida many years ago, which was near perfect and we always remember fondly. We have been back to Florida on 5 occasions and the standards are always high.One final warning, seems if you are carrying anything other than a Disney carrier bag ...beware!at 11o'clock at night, after 13 hours in the park with two young and very tired children. As we were leaving, we were dragged out of the madding crowd just outside the park by security and hauled to one side and being demanded to produce receipts for every item we had purchased in in park. (almost all children's toys) Even the hats our grandsons had on their heads. Much of which we had purchased the day before, with the receipts being back at the hotel.When we asked why with literally thousands and thousands of other people pushing past us at that very moment all rushing to get to their buses and cars, most dressed up in hats and ears and ...... well you get the picture! Why we were pulled over (and this guy was trying to look in our bags as well) We were advised it was because one of our carrier bags was one the we had brought with us and not an official Disney carrier bag!!!!! I am a very patient person but believe me, it would have been well worth the assault charge to deck the brainless jobsworth.When he saw how angry he was making us he backed off.What a way to totally kill what had been a very frustrating day anyway.Disneyland Paris really just do not have it right and are doing the magic of Disney no good at all.",Disneyland_Paris
176561308,3,2013-9,Malta,"Overall it's a magical place but there are 4 areas for significant improvement in my opinion: 1) weekends (especially sundays) are far too busy. numbers must be limited or controlled. we were there on a sunday in mid september and the crowds and waiting times were unbearable.2)they need to improve the food options. Almost all restaurants are self service with more queuing. Most restaurants serve the same thing (burgers, fast food, etc.) after queuing all morning for rides it would be good to sit down and be served a slow meal at your table. 3) I'd expect more disney characters to be visible around the park and more frequency of parades. There is just one big parade at 17:00 daily and a train with the characters going round on the hour. 4) they need to find ways to reduce waiting time. Fast pass is a good idea but needs to be rolled out on all rides and when I tried it the machines were faulty so it was touch n go. Alternatively they could make airing more fun by having characters go round the queues and entertain the kids.",Disneyland_Paris
176495342,4,2013-9,United Kingdom,"Love Disney, this park isn't as good as Florida but it is better value for a day pass if purchased in GB before you go. Plenty going on all day long with characters in designated areas as certain times of the day, parades, night time show with fireworks (which are silent so great for anyone who doesn't like the noise of them going off) the rides are brilliant but fast passes are needed to get on more popular ones or waiting times are long, so get your fast passes as soon as you can. Eating and drinks in the park are expensive, especially if you have kids with you, so take something in with you or be prepared for the expense.",Disneyland_Paris
176459216,5,2013-9,United Kingdom,"Fantastic day out! Negatives   Very busy, long queues and expensive food. However... The positives   The rides that did take ages to queue for were well worth the wait. The theming is second to none, much better than Alton Towers here in the UK. Even though the park is now 20 years old you would not think it at all! Everything is set out perfectly and just looks like the 'perfect' place. Nothing was too much for any of the staff when you needed to find something. The night time spectacular is one of the best things i have ever seen, thousands of people watched this. Is was amazing. included at the price of your ticket and starts at 21:00 on weekdays and 22:00 on weekends. The RER A back to paris still runs afterwards as does the metro once back into paris. (Still safe to use at night). All in all, a long and very enjoyable day!",Disneyland_Paris
176440743,4,2013-7,Canada,"To be fair, we had a great day! But we always make the best of things, and just love hanging out together, so we rarely have a bad day anywhere!We are big disney fans and have visited the other parks, so were excited to see the differences.The park was not as dirty as I had read about.The staff were not as grumpy as people were saying!There was definitely less 'magic' than other parks. Can't quite say why...There was a lot of unaccompanied school groups. There's always groups at Disneyworld, but being much bigger I think it's less obvious and less intrusive. You don't hear much bad language from kids while in the US parks, especially when they are representing their school or club. But the british kids have potty mouths! My youngest had her mouth open more at the bad language than the disney magic!! : D Maybe that's why it felt less magical!We didn't like the smoking, but were expecting it.The best thing about the park was the anniversary lightshow fireworks that end the day! It was amazing! Made everything else forgotten about. Really the best closing show I have seen in any park. Until that point I wasn't sure if it had been worth losing a day in Paris.We were glad we went.Disney hotel was another matter! But I have reviewed that separately!",Disneyland_Paris
176416978,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Yes we had a fantastic day and the kids loved it. We spent 600 euros on a single day (excluding travel, hotels, which is ridiculous) including 65 euros for some average burgers and fries   the lady on the till even apologised for the price. Well, we did expect this so cant really complain as it was a once in a lifetime special day for the little ones.What has irked me is the customer service. I gave each child 20 euros to buy a toy from one of the many shops. My 5 year old chose a Buzz Lightyear spinning light thing that cost about 12 euros. He excitedly took the money to the till and paid himself (being a big boy now!). The next day, the said toy fell apart whilst being used in the car resulting in a very upset little boy. Dont worry, I thought, an email to Disney and I am sure that Disney magic will put this right. Oh no. Without a receipt they wont even entertain it. Even though the toy is a DLP exclusive and has the barcode still attached. I understand that stance and yes technically you need a receipt, but this isnt just buying a toy from a high street shop, this is a memory of a special day that cost a small fortune. Very poor from Disney not to offer something as a gesture of goodwill and to try and help a small boy who doesnt understand why he has no toy from his day, but his brothers and sister do.",Disneyland_Paris

176377012,4,2013-9,United Kingdom,children loved this holiday. I have visited the park a few times in its 21 years and I was rather disappointed to find not a lot of characters walking about which I found on my previous visits. My children wanted autographs and it was fairly staged how they went about getting them and when time was up that was it and the children were disappointed. The light show was spectacular. The park was very expensive and I feel it was too expensive for average families.,Disneyland_Paris
176355513,4,2013-9,Ireland,Was very disappointed with Disneyland Paris. Would never go again. No characters to be seen anywhere. No parade. Went in 1999 and was fab time but has changed the children were so disappointed they were dying to see Mickey or Minnie or princesses. They seen Winnie the Pooh and was turned away when the children wanted to go see him. Was very expensive. On the plus point the rides were very good.,Disneyland_Paris

176253167,5,2013-8,United Arab Emirates,"Visited Disneyland Paris from 10 12 August 2013 with my family. Stayed in Disney Hotel New Port Bay which was walkable distance to the park. Weather in Paris was very pleasant, occasional mild drizzle. My daughter enjoyed all the rides in Fantasy land esp. Dumbo, Tea cups, It's a small world, Peter pan, Alice maze. Some of the thrill rides like Big thunder mountain, Space mission 2, Indiana Jones test your mental and emotional strength. Orbitron, Buzz light year, Car ride, Big thunder boat ride etc., are enjoyable.Disneyland staff were very helpful, speak english, wait times are updated for each ride.Watched the 20th Anniversary show and firecracker display at the end of the day at 11 pm.It was amazing. Disney parade at 07 pm is worth its wait, we all enjoyed like kids. Disneyland was a lot crowded during our visit and we took full advantage of the magic hours which enabled us to complete many rides ahead of the crowd.Fast pass is useful.We all felt refreshed and fresh after this visit. Highly recommended for Kids and Adults.",Disneyland_Paris
176230461,4,2013-9,United Kingdom,"This was our first visit to a disneyland resort we took our 3 year old son and 6 month old daughter. My son loved it here, there were plenty of rides he could go on as well as plenty of things to play on and explore. You need to get onto the park early to miss all the queues. We all had a great time and were prepared for the cost of everything after reading other reveiws. The only thing that put a dampner on it for us was the pushing in and shoving for rides and waiting to see shows. Two days are enough to test your patience to the limit, no one is capable of queueing or showing any consideration for anyone else to the point that we were waiting for the Disney dreams show at the end of the day and our buggy was rammed out of the way so that someone coud get them and their daughter into a space no bigger than a square ft. The lack of consideration for others was a bit of a shocker to us especially dodging people's cigarettes. This is a great place for the kids but be prepared for the pushing.",Disneyland_Paris

The staff are extremely friendly all over the park and they all speak English which is great. We went in the summer holidays and believe me its like the whole worlds there yet they manage to cope so well, it's all very well organised. Definitely worth staying in a Disney hotel on site to make use of the Extra Magic Hours and Fastpass service especially during the summer holidays. The Fastpass works really well (I had some doubts about it beforehand) you only have to wait literally 10 15 mins for a ride that everyone else has to queue up for around 60 90 mins. Maybe I enjoyed it more because I had mentally prepared myself and accepted that yes it will be busy and yes I will have to do a lot of queueing   but when I got there it wasn't as bad as I'd thought.

176182601,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"After years of nagging I finally agreed to take my now teenage daughter to Disneyland, but in order to avoid the hefty financial burden of a USA trip, we went to Disneyland Paris. We stayed in Paris so we could go sightseeing one day (fantastic day out!) and Disneyland on the second day of our weekend trip. The train out to Disneyland was not the most pleasant of journeys as the train and stations are fairly dingy and the ticket machine was a bit challenging at first, but fairly cheap and easy to navigate. I have always avoided the intense marketing of all things 'Disney' where possible so I was amazed to find myself instantly in love with the place! Entering the park and seeing 'Main Street USA' looking so pretty and the impressive castle ahead   well, it was a 'WOW!' moment. My daughter had planned our route through the twin parks so off we went (handy app available for android phones!). The rides had the queue times posted and we didn't wait nearly as long as advertised at any of the rides (we didn't use the advance booking system) and found that queuing was part of the fun (lots to take in while waiting). The rides were amazing, even for someone who has a real fear of rollercoasters. The food wasn't as bad or as expensive as I'd anticipated but we really didn't eat much during our tour (you don't want a full stomach if you're being flung around at high speed). For me, the Star Wars simulator ride (where we effectively helped to blow up the Death Star!) and the Armageddon attraction (although without Bruce Willis in a vest!) were highlights. The Pirates of the Caribbean attraction was a real unexpected surprise   a huge and impressive set. There was plenty to keep visitors of all ages happy but I think by the end of the very long day we had done it all so I was pleased I hadn't booked to stay longer, although if you have little ones with you then staying on site makes sense. The only sour note is that smoking isn't banned in the park so designated smoking areas would be a pleasant addition (but this is France, so unlikely to happen unfortunately). The cherry on the cake was the parade which started up just as we were about to leave, so we stayed a little longer out of curiosity and I am so glad we did. Clearly this is what Disney does best   capturing the imagination and hearts of everyone who watched huge floats with all the favourite characters and a huge cast of extras singing and dancing their way along Main Street. A fantastic spectacle not to be missed. If, by the end of your visit to Disneyland, you haven't been moved then you have no imagination and soul!",Disneyland_Paris

They usually come free with all the Entrance tickets. And get fast pass tickets as soon as you arrive.

PLAN YOUR DAY by the minute.  If you want to eat in good a'la carte restaurants or eat all you can buffets in the Disneyland Park, book your reservations early in the morning. Do not wait until you're hungry.  If you are on a budget, bring your own drinks and food.   Do your eating and resting while waiting for the parade or the fireworks.  If you're gonna spend more than a day here, the best times to avoid queues are an hour before and during the parade and fireworks. There are hardly any queues at all.

176022288,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"....I had very low expectations to begin with. Visited Disneyland Park with two children (3 and 5) in August. I was impressed with the layout and overall appearance of the Park and getting in was fairly easy (we already had our tickets before travelling there). Despite being high summer the ride queues weren't horrendous and in any case our boys are not big fans of rides anyway so we could just enjoy strolling round. Autopia probably wasn't worth the 30 minute wait and we were able to get a FastPass ticket for Buzz Lightyear but on returning found that the ride had broken down. It's a Small World is great for young children and the queue was very quick indeed. Pirates of the Carribean in hindsight was a mistake   parents NB there are two steep drops during the ride which aren't advertised so be warned. We were lucky to stumble across a group of characters when walking round (The Chipmunks, Goofy and Donald Duck) and they were excellent with the children, really bringing the characters to life despite the restrictions of the costumes and ensuring that children waited their turn.We ate in the Hyperion restaurant near Space Mountain   this was abysmal; a thirty minute wait (mainly thanks to the incompetent staff) for alleged fast food which was over priced and of poor quality. The dining room itself was good with large TV's playing Disney cartoons to entertain the children. We waited until 7pm for the parade and were glad that we did   it was excellent and the highlight for our children at the end of the day.I wouldn't go back in a hurry but am glad that our children were able to enjoy the day and take away some special memories of their visit.",Disneyland_Paris

175955085,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Go to florida! The park has a serious wasp issue, the ques were ridiculously long, one afternoon we managed (With fastpass) 3 ques and 2 rides, we had to leave to meet a booked dinner slot. So 4 hours of my life wasted. The placed needed a lick of paint. Want to meet the characters? Forget it, quing for hours to have a photo with a guy dressed in a suit is not worth it. Biggest waste of my money and time. Did I mention the wasps, makes quing interesting. Smokers should be banned from the place, you cannot get away from tobacco smoke, my poor kids are now on 40 a day. Please avoid at all costs and go to florida, or blackpool where this siht is expected!",Disneyland_Paris
175951722,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Our 3rd family visit over a four day period and it was markedly busier than the same time in previous years. Although I expect queues on two if the four days the park seemed at bursting point and I wondered if the 20th anniversary offers had been too successful. The fast pass got us on one ride per day only, the remainder had over one hour queues so averaged around four a day of any note so this made poor value. There were less characters accessible to the children and fewer small accessible shows. Smoking by adults around children was common place and toilet waiting time for the girls was up to 30 minutes and long waits for drinks. I have had good times at Disney and the girls still speak favourably although even they reached the point of asking to go home. I do think Disney need to look at the place through the eyes of families and aim to improve. It will be a long time before I go near a Disney again.",Disneyland_Paris
175951636,5,2013-9,United States,"A perfect place for children and adults of all ages...I hadn't been since I was a teenager and it was just as magical...the feeling you get walking down Main Street and seeing the castle in front of you is beautiful!We stayed in a Disney hotel and had the (standard) full board dining option and found that the choice in the park was adequate and portions plentiful.We planned in advance what we'd like to do see (would suggest that to anyone to do so) but as we had small children spent the majority of our time in fantasyland. We had a three day pass to both parks and spent two days in Disneyland as it requires more than a day to cover it all   if you have a princess obsessed daughter I'd recommend queuing early for a reservation to meet one as it gets very busy! On the Sunday the park was very busy and by the Tuesday (beautiful weather) it was much quieter   we only queued 10 minutes for space mountain and Buzz Lightyear. The fireworks show at night is a must, doesn't start til the park closing time (buggies and blankets for my little ones   4, 2 and 8 months   was a godsend) but it lasts a good 20 minutes!All in all, it's amazing and I would recommend it to anyone.",Disneyland_Paris

175867465,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,Have a    non smoking policy    in the park but only notify smokers by having it in tiny 8 point font lost amongst other minor items on the park map.There are NO signs outdoors or announcements so smokers when accosted are surprised (and frequently apologetic) and non smokers are offended by inhaling cigarette smoke in a supposedly non smoking environment.,Disneyland_Paris

175840099,5,2013-8,United Arab Emirates,"Visited with my husband and 16 year old daughter   technically not quite the typical target audience for this Park, but we loved it .....For those who have not forgotten the child in you and for those who still believe in dreams, a trip to any Disneyland is a must.Disneyland Paris just completed 20 years   extended anniversary celebrations still on, so that was lovely. The Walt Disney studio was a bonusWould strongly recommend an overnight stay atleast, if not 2 nights   to enjoy both the parks. Preferably in one of the Disney properties   gives you a few advantages like extra hours in the park, meals in the Village, etc.For those visiting this place, do read up whats on offer and decide what you would like to experience and what you should avoid. So plan!Most of the popular rides have huge waiting time, but if you plan your tour well, you could cut it short a bit. The rides are mostly worth it.otherwise even just walking around the Park and its 4 zones has its own thrill. For me, a good part of this trip was just watching the sheer glee on the faces of the litte visitors when they recognised a character walking past or a castle or a car   it was enough for me to want to be 5 again!!! The innocence, the simple joys :)Food and beverages inside the park are available but pricey so plan to carry your own water and meals outside would possibly be a better option.Parades are not to be missed, as well as the fireworks with the castle in the background.All in all, an escape from reality   well worth it.",Disneyland_Paris
175817889,4,2013-8,United States,"Presented below is a letter that I wrote to Bob Iger about my family experience at Disneyland Paris from an American Tourist perspective. Also attached is the very timely response from DLP Executive Management. Hope this helps with trip planning. I would encourage anyone planning on visiting for just one day to get the VIP Fast Pass at City Hall. The cost is 60 euro a person and if you plan right and do the Crush Coaster first and then go over to Disneyland and ride both the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean then all other rides are walk on for the rest of the day. In addition, we had lunch on main street and the cost per person was 10 euro each for a very good sandwich, chips and drink. The buffet next door was three times as much per person. (Email sent in August 2013 to Bob Ige, President and CEO of Disney) Mr Iger  We are very loyal Disney family that has stayed numerous times at the flagship Disneyland USA and Disney World Florida. We visited Disneyland Anaheim for both the 50th and 55th Anniversary. This summer we decided to do a side trip from our vacation in Paris and try Disneyland Paris for the day and experience the 20th Anniversary of the park. Presented below is some feedback on your European Parks from an American visitor perspective:  1.) PLANNING   The online ticket process was a breeze and travelling from central Paris was easy. Finding information in English was not a problem.  2.) MAIN GATE   The staff at the main gate were very friendly and helpful and the main gate area looked in fine Disney shape. The entrance was exactly as expected and very nice and beautiful. Security screening was standard and moved quickly.3.)STAFFING   In the Disneyland Paris itself the rides did not seem to be staffed at the levels they are in the United States. Pirates of the Caribbean was only staffed by what appeared to be 3 cast members only loading one boat at a time. I first thought that it was early in the day and that due to crowds that they maybe rotating staff around the park but this was not the case.4.RIDE WAITS   At most E Ticket attractions the staff was quite small and only half of capacity was used. So lines were generally long due to what appeared to be staffing issues. 5.)ATTRACTION MAINTENANCE Some of the queue lines were quite worn and needed TLC. The music on the Rock N Roll AeroSmith Coaster was not working which changes the ride experience. The Star Wars ride was worn and tired with several broken seats in the ride vehicle. The Thunder Mountain ride was very loud going up the lift hills and rough on the tracks. Compared to your parks in the US the standards seemed to be lacking. 6.)FOOD SERVICE   Food Service was very efficient and the quality of the food was good. I think the food service section is on par with the parks in the United States. 7.)SMOKING POLICY Allowing smoking in the parks was quite a smelly mess and unexpected for a Disney experience. I have never been to a Disney Park where smoking was allowed. Many guests were smoking in the queue lines which was not great. The cast members did there best to stop people but given the number of staff it was a difficult challenge. It may be a cultural thing, but it is a turn off for a family amusement park. 8.) OVERALL IMPRESSION   We did have a great time at Disneyland Paris and we would return again, but the park does need some TLC and fine tuning to make it a world class destination. Just wanted to provide some feedback since I saw an open letter to you on the conditions of the Disneyland Paris parks. As an American tourists it was nice to visit a place that seemed familiar but seemed different at the same time. The layout and design of the parks are great and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and the Space Mountain MIssion 2 were both incredible attractions. I hope you keep the Disney brand shining bright and providing some TLC and staffing improvements at Disneyland Paris. Thanks again for your attention in this matterResponse from DLP Executives (Very Prompt Response) Thank you for your email addressed to Robert A.

No too much people, the wait time was not excesive and all the park was clean and well maintained. There were a lot of children but it is also perfect for go with friends or your couple.The prices? Everything expensive, of course.",Disneyland_Paris
175772047,2,2013-7,United States,"A place for children, for good clean fun like Disneyland, should not be so filled with cigarette smoke. Everywhere you turn, whether eating, or whether waiting for the evening show, people are smoking cigarettes. While waiting for the evening show, one father walked 20 feet away from his own children to smoke so he would not expose them to the noxious fumes...but the site he chose was just upwind of several other families with children. There is supposedly a 'smoking area', but no one uses it, and no one, absolutely no one, is enforcing any rules about smoking.  Other than the constant noxious fumes, the park had its good points and its bad points. Sleeping Beauty's Castle is beautiful, and the dragon in the lair is very good. The evening show was quite good, though much less developed and shorter than shows at the US theme parks.  The staff seem variably committed to providing a nice experience. Unlike the original Disneyland Park, where every detail is attended to, Disneyland Paris staff is far from perfectionist in their work. The grounds are dirty, buildings in need of cleaning and paint, and the service is slow. Quite disappointing   not worth the long trek outside the city of Paris   skip this one and spend your time on the wonderful attractions inside the city.",Disneyland_Paris

175750702,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"What a magical place to enjoy but definitely it depends on personal preferences. I am crazy for Disney ( Characters, movies, their collectibles, comics  what not) and thats why I went back my childhood. I was running from here to there   like a kid. First of all, if you want to enjoy the park properly then it is better to spend two days in Disneyland Park and one day in Disneyland studio. Both of them are situated next to each other but you need separate tickets. I bought my ticket online and this will give you best price as well as time saver(what is very important for a tour). Tickets are not expensive because it is Disney. I think it is worthy because you just need entrance ticket and after going inside you can ride all the rides multiple times ( depends on how you using your time). RER trains are frequent ( every 15 minutes) and stopping in Marne la Vallee. From the exit of the station you can see the parks or just follow the crowds(less than 5 min walks).At first they will check you bag and you can enter inside and from there you need to walk towards either Disneyland park or studio.Before the ticket checkpoint you will find the map and program schedule. After entering inside the park you will found staffs standing to help you with your questions. In my two days of visit I haven't found any rude staff at all. Disneyland is a completely different place inside Paris. If you want enjoy most of the rides then do not forget to do your home work before going over there. Few rides are very popular   so make a plan like which one you want to ride first and don't forget about their FastPass system.Try to remember the time for main parade   do not miss that. We were lucky to enjoy Disney Dreams. Because of their 20th anniversary now they are showing it everyday. So, if you can get any special shows for the same price then why not go for some special days when are showing those fantastic works. Someone told me that water is really expensive over there but you know what  in the whole park you will find loads of proper drinking fountains to refill your empty bottle. Toilets are very clean and sufficient. After the main parade if you can run quickly   you will get very small queue or no crowd at all. I am not sure that they allow outside food or not but I have seen other people to have some outside foods. Foods are expensive but not like untouchable may be   2 or   3 extra comparing UK Mcdonald's. But definitely price depends on the restaurant category. I had our food from Market House Deli from the main street. For less than   20 we had grilled vegetable sandwich, pizza(one person), muffin and soft drinks. So, overall I am really really happy and enjoyed a lot. If you like to avoid extreme crowd then try to go there in off season but still it will be crowdy because it is Disney.",Disneyland_Paris
175742865,3,2013-9,Australia,"I think if we hadn't been to Disneyland in LA, and Florida I think it would have been a lot better. The queues for rides where huge. Food outlets were overpriced and crowded. The staff looked unhappy not like LA every one looked like they loved there jobs and being paid were a bonus but not in euro disney. It just didn't feel like the happiest place in the world. ( just no magic). There were a few rides that are not at other parks. Even the parade at Disneyland Paris had come and gone with out even knowing it was on. We caught the end 10 min and didn't even know. Main Street weren't even blocked off. Like at other park were you have to get your spot 2 hours before . My tips. Get a few day pass with magic mornings. It costs a bit more but you can go in 2 hours before the public.Take a few snacks and drinks, saves you some money to spent on Disney souvenirs. As soon as you go in go start to the big rides. If you wait for a few hours the waiting time is 1 hour  Also a good time to go is when the parades are on",Disneyland_Paris

So be patient.We had halfboard at our hotel (and parks). That was convenient, because we could choose to visit restaurants and cafes at our own pace in the middle of the day, and at our own expence.The best funfairs and attractions for adult and teens are at Disney studio park, and Disneyland park is best for children.

We went for 3 nights 4 days in nov, the park was very busy, worst ques were thunder mountain, buzz light year lazer, we didn't get to see everything, were going again in 3 weeks for 4 nights 5 days!! Tips would be fast track is a deffinate time saver, baby switch means u que up once and swap with hubby after so he doesn't have to que, get to tram tours at 9am and wait as its very busy, we sat down an hour early to watch parade too and people were trying to get past us!! They European people were dreadfully rude!! ESP when queuing, the have no prob trampling kids, shoving u out the way and pushing in!! ESP at the buses after fireworks, we were shoved with a pram and 5 year old off 2 buses!! Santa Fe resturant was fab, really lovely food for any of the fam and all u can eat!! It is very expensive for food but we had breakfast in hotel, snuck out pan au chocolates and rolls, then filled them with tuna we bought and crisps and cereal bars.

I love how Phantom Manor is different than the US Haunted Mansions. What got me was the healthy snack food they sell . I also learned Tshirts are definitely an American thing because they dont have a huge selection. LOL.Each park is unique unto itself....Just go !!!!(off season), you'll be glad you did.",Disneyland_Paris
175585396,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"It is a good day out. We stayed at a Disney hotel and had the option to enter the park before the general public which we took advantage of on two days and would definitely recommend. We arrived on the Eurostar, checked our luggage in at Marnee la Vallee station and it was taken to our hotel for us, so we could go straight into the park. Our hotel, park tickets and Meal plus tickets vouchers were given to us on the Eurostar by a Disney rep (for this reason I would recommend Eurostar over flying, plus with flying you have to be at the airport two hours before flight, and then have to get from the airport to Disney which is another hour plus added on your travel). Last time I went to Disneyland in Paris (which was a September), it was far busier than it was in August which I didn't expect at all. There were a couple of rides that we had to queue for over an hour and a half for (Thunder Mountain was the longest). I did notice that the rides for the very young children had immense queues (Peter Pan Snow White etc), we only went on one of these as my children are older and weren't to bothered about missing these. Not all of the restaurants are open all of the time, so check this if you want to go to a specific restaurant cafe. The park guides can also let you know and they are walking through the park, though not all can speak English.One thing I have noticed every time I've gone to Disneyland Paris (and what many other English families were complaining about) is the rudeness of people there. It wasn't too bad for us as there were four of us, but last time I visited I was on my own with my son, and the time before that my eldest two children were very young (under 5). If you have manners you will at some time in your visit get wound up with people pushing in or standing right on top of you (I even had a man physically push my son out of the way once on our last visit when my son was 8 9 years old because he wanted to get in front of us for the ride). If you can tolerate for a stay of 3 or more days and keep calm then you should be congratulated.",Disneyland_Paris
175565113,5,2012-10,Ireland,Been here twice now! When I was 6 and when I was 16. Loved it both times! First time as family and second on a school trip. The rock and Roll rollercoaster is good!

175492607,5,2013-8,United States,"I'll start by saying that I am a huge Disney fan and I was hesitant about spending a day here because of so many negative reviews and people telling me it  just isn't the same  as Disney World in Florida. However we had a fantastic time and while I still think Disney World is tops, Disneyland Paris was quite magical too.We got here in the afternoon after spending the morning at Disney Studios. We learned quickly that fastpass is just as important useful here as it is in other Disney parks  we used it to go on Thunder Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, and Space Mountain. In between, while waiting for fastpass times to arrive, we were able to get on rides like Pirates of the Caribbean, It's a Small World, Phantom Manor, and Indiana Jones with little to no wait! It takes a bit of advance planning but with a bit of patience you can still do a lot of rides even on very busy days. Having a plan that includes fastpass use rather than milling about willy nilly will ensure that you get to see more and do more. The cast members we encountered were great and we found the park to be clean and filled with  Disney fied  decor!One of the not so great things was the food  VERY expensive. Your choices were either fast food, overpriced buffets, or extravagant luxury dining  I wish there had been a more casual sit down meal available. Also, another negative that Americans in particular might be turned off by is the smoking  people smoking throughout so many ride queues and around so many kids! There aren't any laws there that prevent it so it is something you just have to deal with.But I went there as a Disney fan to experience the magic of Disney  the rollercoasters were thrilling, the other rides were just as great as in the US parks, and the atmosphere was certainly magical. I can see how the long lines and crowds can be frustrating  buying a guide and planning ahead will definitely be worth it. I'm so glad I went and I hope to go back someday!",Disneyland_Paris

We should have turned around and went home at this stage, but they already had our money. Once we finally got inside all we found that we could get to were souvenier shops or overpriced food stalls. The wait time for any ride was one or two hours. How is this fun for kids? If the place can't handle this many people they should cap how many they let in. But they are quite happy to take thousands of people's money on a busy day and for them all to have a crappy time. In the four hours we spent there 3 hours were spent in lines, 4 minutes on rides and 56 minutes sitting down wondering what it was all for. Commercialised crap. I felt so sorry for my 8yo daughter, it was so dissapointing for her. I even felt sorry for my 40yo husband who was almost as excited to go, and was equally disgusted. Save your money people. If you want to have a nice day out with your kids take them to the beach or a park instead!!",Disneyland_Paris
175432578,5,2013-8,Bulgaria,"Children paradise. Everything was perfect the rides, the meetings with the characters, the hotel, the food in the restaurants, the night shows. The staff is very helpful and speak English!!! My favourite ride is the pirates of Carrebean. I recommend it to everyone.There are two minuses: the prices of the hotel and tickets the crowdsDespite these two minuses Paris Disneyland is must visit place, esp.if you are with children",Disneyland_Paris
175429260,1,2013-9,United Kingdom,"We booked a three night trip to visit Eurodisney with our 4 and 5 year old children. We stayed at the Explorers hotel, which was the perfect place for our family (see the separate review).However, we were bitterly disappointed by the 2 day Eurodisney experience. We arrived on day one around 10.15 and queued to bag check for ten minutes. Little did we realise this would be the shortest queue of the day!As Explorers isn't a Disney hotel, we couldn't take advantage of the earlier opening times, nor were the rides aimed at my children's age group included in the Fastpass scheme.We started by going around the Sleeping Beauty castle at my 4 year old's request. There was no queue. We walked around and it was very pretty and gave good views from the upper floor which enabled us to get our bearings a bit more. As we exited, the ubiquitous gift shop offering princess dresses was situated outside. The price for a Rapunzel princess dress sized for a 5 year old was 70 euros! We then went on the carousel (30 min wait) and then into the Pinnochio ride which was advertised at 20 min ride, getting to the front of the queue in 40 minutes! Half way around the queue, my youngest needed the toilet, so I ducked out the queue, leaving my other half with the other child, and we went to use possibly the dirtiest toilets I have used in a very long time (remember, this was only 11.30) situated around the back of the ride. We were able to rejoin the family in the queue. My children found part of the ride quite scary and my daughter proclaimed that she really hated the ride when we got off!So, keen to get the day back on track, we decided to go into Adventureland to grab lunch. Forgive me for including the following experience, but I think it demonstrates the poor customer service very well:We visited the Cafe Agrabah and arrived just before noon as we wanted to ensure we got there early in case we needed to wait. Already there was a couple with a young child in a pushchair who had already made a reservation. The greeter started by stating that the restaurant was not yet open. We said we would wait. She then said  there are no tables until 2.30 . OK, I said, we will book and come back.  I can't take a booking until noon . I replied,  It's noon now!   Oh , she replied,  Is it?  The other couple said  Is it possible for us to go inside?   We don't open until noon  was the reply.  It's noon now , said the couple.  You need to book as we are fully booked .  We have booked  replied the couple.  For what time?  said the greeter.  Noon , replied the couple.  I will have to check  said the greeter who then disappeared, leaving her colleague, when queried where his colleague was, he just said  I don't work on this desk . Flabbergasted, we left the poor couple waiting to see if they would ever be allowed into the restaurant.We then decided, as clearly a buffet lunch was going to be too difficult, we would just get a snack.So, we called in at the Hakuna Matata fast food joint. There were massive queues and, despite it now being 12.25, it was clear they hadn't started serving lunch!So, we joined the queue to at least pay for the order. There was very limited choice   basically it was glorified chicken nuggets and chips with a salad option for the vegetarians. The children's menu didn't include fries   just the choice between 8 cherry tomatoes in a bag or plain boiled rice. We then waited 15 minutes to actually get our food and wished we hadn't bothered. We ended up paying 38 euros for two adult meals and two children's meals. The content of the adult meal was five 8cm x 4 cm pieces of breaded chicken and a few serrated slices of deep fried potato plus a diet coke, the children's meal was two 8cm x 3cm pieces of breaded chicken (unseasoned) then one child had 8 cherry tomatoes and the other had rice. They also got a yoghurt drink and apple juice. The wrong juice was supplied   we had to correct the order, and the child meal with rice wasn't supplied   so had to be corrected.The inside seating area was filthy and dark. A memorable meal for all the wrong reasons, we ate quickly and left. The competition have  No Worries  with this one. We went up the Swiss family robinson treehouse (queue kept moving so not bad) which gave good views of the park but left with the youngest declaring  This is boring, can we do something good now .We found the Pirate area and were much relieved to discover two little play parks to occupy the children. They then wanted to go on the impressive looking Pirate ship on the water   but it wasn't open to the public!We ventured into the caves and eventually queued up for 45 minutes to go on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride which the children enjoyed (although queuing in the dark was a little frightening for my youngest).Returning to Fantasyland , we joined the mammoth queue on the Dumbo ride. This little cracker took 80 minutes to get onto the 2 minute ride. However, we were kept entertained by a large number of the queuing punters having a row over two women with children elbowing their way through the queue. There was a round of applause when the ride attendant told them to leave without going on the ride. There was a pungent aroma of urine in the queue   we discovered the reason for this later!We followed this with an ice cream   which was absolutely rock hard! I have never seen such over frozen ice cream ever! We wondered if this was simply the booth we had chosen   but we visited another booth the next day and it was the same.We decided to visit the It's a Small World ride, which I had visited in Florida, so knew what to expect. The children loved it and the 20 minute ride wasn't too onerous. We ended our day in Fantasyland to go on the Autopia ride. The queue advertised 45 minutes, but ended up being 65 minutes. Just within sight of the end of the queue, both children needed the toilet, so we had to forego the ride having queued for all that time..... Now we know why the Dumbo ride was pongy   parents didn't dare step out of the queue to take their children to the toilet!The following day, we got there a little earlier   and was greeted by longer queues for the bag check. We started by racing around to the car ride we had failed to make the day before, but found the queue as long as we had left it the day before! We duly queued for an hour and got to go on the two minute ride! We did the Nautilus walkthrough attraction (no queue) and then saw the Captain EO which the grown ups enjoyed but children found a bit scary. We decided to get on the Disney train to go around to Frontierland for lunch   big mistake. We didn't get on the first train, so had to wait for the next one which was being taken from a siding. When it arrived, was covered in soot which got on everyone's clothes and was moving slowly (until a driver got out of the train and sprinkled sand on the tracks to give it traction!) We abandoned our lunch plan, and decided to go to the Disney Studio Park for lunch. We arrived and had decided we would just grab a hot dog. There were three people in front of us in the queue, yet it still took 20 minutes to be served! The kids were complaining about being hungry and when I got to the front of the queue, I was greeted with the news that there were only three hotdogs left! The time was 1.30pm.So, now understanding why other guests in our hotel were smuggling rolls out at breakfast time, we abandoned the queue and found another stand and walked away victorious with four cold hot dogs, two cokes, two juices and two packets of salt and vinegar crisps (no ketchup left!) Another 38 euros...We aimed for Toy story playland as it looked in the guide like it would be more suitable for our children's age group. Sadly, this wasn't the case. We went on the slinky dog ride (30 minute wait) and the Flying Carpet ride (45 minute wait) but the 90 minute wait on the other rides put us off! We then watched the Stars and Cars parade of 14 cars at 4pm. The children, seemingly completely underwhelmed, said  Please can we go back to the hotel now and have a swim!?!  So we left!I had previously been to Disneyland Florida with a friend and her children, but went with an open mind. I was expecting a lot of rides to be unsuitable for the children as they are young and haven't been on rides before. I am used to the concept of the ridiculous queues (although Florida seem to make it more enjoyable). I was not expecting great quality food. I also knew we were unlikely to see the Disneyland Park parade or evening show as they are simply too late for the children (7pm and 10pm respectively). I am not afraid of paying the price for a good service and quality product   however, in my opinion, Eurodisney offers neither. As other reviewers have also noted   Eurodisney completely lacks the Disney magic experience that usually makes it palatable to pay the high prices. We won't be back.",Disneyland_Paris

175416348,1,2013-8,Spain,"I was surprised how small it was. I am used to bigger theme parks with better rides. Long queues for poor rides. Only a few characters were walking around and Donald Duck was specially mean to the kids. To see the Princesses you had to make a queue (only 5 times a day with people left out being really mad) to make an appointent to see them. Nice. The parade is nothing like I expected from Disney. And just make it to make it worst, what terrible uniforms the staff had to wear. They made them unisex, bad for both. If you go to Paris you will find lots of better places to you. Go with your children when they are under 5 so they won  t notice all the bad things!",Disneyland_Paris
175414877,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I went to Disney Paris when I was 5. Fifteen years later my innocent view of what a Disney Park looks like was ruined. We were a family of 5, my father, mother, teenage sister and 10 year old brother and I. First off, we had rented a car and the great thing was we could pay 15 Euros for parking at the venue for the entire day. However, as we walk towards the Disney attractions we find Army men with large guns and unpleasant faces patrolling the area about 100 meters away from the gates which allow you to go into the Disney Village. I understand that safety is the utmost importance in a place where millions of people gather, however, this park is for children, you're not meant to scare anyone. People are supposed to feel safe, not threatened. They should find a solution to their Army men located in prime areas maybe in a colorful fortress where children might not be frightened by the scene. As we walked into the village, the place seemed beautiful. People laughing, kids running and a wide selection of well known restaurants. We were instantly attracted to eating at Planet Hollywood, having tried it in London and Orlando we were enthusiastic to try it in France too. It was horrible. The lady at the service area was grumpy and pissed off, the food was not anything Planet Hollywood should be proud to sell and the tables were dirty. Everything was so cramped up in the center and it was all an unpleasant experience. After our meal, we decided we to check out the IMAX cinema which featured all the latest movies. My younger brother was so keen on watching 'Lone Ranger' we decided to go. Now to attract more people the French must understand that they must swallow their pride! Every movie was showing in French! I thought it was obnoxious, especially since they need tourists to like what they offer because of the depressed economic situation in France. I've realized that if we didn't know a few words in French they dealt with their customers poorly. It made me wonder what kind of customer service philosophy they have. I've traveled all over the world, and they've made it clear that they're talking to us because they have to if they want to make any business. The queues were outstanding, 75 to 90 minutes of waiting on rides that last about 30 seconds. They lack in organization skills; a place where the most organization is needed. If Disney Paris don't get their act together they could be losing so many more people in the years to follow. All in all, the thing that really discomforted me and really made me regret the experience was the lack of respect the people working their had for their customers. It was absolutely unbelievable. The people in the rides speak with a tone of frustration, the people at counters are absolutely cold and the whole atmosphere is just dull. There were a few moments when we went into the Studios park and the Attraction park where we found happy people to serve us but that was a rarity; and we had bought 3 day tickets so that was a bummer. Definitely the worst Disneyland experience ever!",Disneyland_Paris

175405895,5,2012-10,Nigeria,We went to Disney as a family of 4. Two adults and two children with ages 11 and 2 years. It was the best vacation ever ! We stayed at an apartment hotel very close to Disney. We were able to cook our food and avoid the very expensive Disney food. we also didn't queue as we bought tickets from our hotel. The queue for each ride was quite long and sometimes frustrating especially when the toddler could not ride some of these attractions.,Disneyland_Paris
175393739,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"This was our big day out for the kids this summer. It started out well as we arrived as soon as it opened and the queues were reasonable. The kids were in awe of the whole place. My son (aged 10) went on the Indiana Jones ride and has not stopped talking about it since and my younger daughter loved the rides she went on. However, as the day went on the queues became ridiculous and nobody wanted to stand for 1 hour and 20 minutes for a ride. In the end we decided we would for Big Thunder Mountain and we were nearly on the ride when they ran into technical problems and just told everyone to leave. No apology and no fast passes to compensate those who had already queued for a long time. Although fast passes would have been no good to us as the ride never got going again during the time we were there, we felt the customer service could have been better. The other issue we had was the time it took to to get served at one of the fast food joints. 20 minutes it took to get served with chicken bugers, chips and soft drinks and there was only a few people ahead of me in the queue. My husband suggested that the fast food outlet should display waiting times in the same way the rides did. The highlight of the day for my daughter (aged 6) was the parade which was excellent. We did go in August and there are more visitors to the park than when we went in August 15 years ago. My advise to anyone would be to avoid the summer months and go at a quieter time of year if you can.",Disneyland_Paris

175294145,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Total lack of atmosphere. Total lack of magic and isnt that what you go to Disney for? From miserable staff, to extensive queues that turn into free for alls with the pushers in, to extortionate prices. Yes you expect things to be more expensive but in one cafe a cheese bagguette which was the same size as those half ones you get in Greggs was 18 euros. So flabberghasted were we all to see this, we all went up in turns to have a look and one of our party even took a photo  well its not every day you see a cheese cob for nearly   20! (cant remember the cafes name but its on the square and it sells cakes and muffins follow the bees and wasps and you'll find it as all the stuff is left exposed and was literally crawling when we were there).Now for the rides. Pirates of the Carribean is fantastic if you can brave the long, dark walk which turns into a bit of a melee the closer you get to the stiles. Its a small world was also really good. The Buzz Lightyear one was brilliant and we made the most of our extra 2 hours in the park on that. Its also where I met the only friendly member of staff who was lovely and helpful and told us all the parade times and seemed genuinly glad to be there. The only other rides that opened early were the dumbo one, the peter pan one, the carousel, the mountain one and the dragon attraction under the castle. The parades were good, not brilliant though and very 'samey' as you'd imagine. The fireworks were amazing. We watched them on the Thursday night and after four days of being pushed and swore at and trampled on and smoked on and rude service and paying through the nose for everything and a crappy hotel (New York), the fireworks almost, but not quite, made me hate Disney a little less. I'd looked forward to my holiday but after everything I would not go back if they paid me. I honestly wouldnt. Its not half as good as Id have hoped. And three times as bad as I would have ever dreaded. And the toilets were grimey, dank and stinky.",Disneyland_Paris

175174478,3,2013-7,Australia,"We travelled with three teenagers to Paris Disneyland. Catching the train from Paris was very straight forward, just follow the families when you need to change trains! Having been to Anaheim Disneyland, Paris Disneyland was a disappointment. There is just no Disney atmosphere and the staff are not easily seen or don't show any eagerness to appear happy and helpful. We found it to be the opposite on a previous trip to Anaheim and at the end of this trip when we went to Hong Kong Disneyland (which was great). One day was enough to cover both parks, maybe two days for younger children but our older kids who love Disney preferred to go back to Paris for the evening. The food was expensive,    70 approx. for five burger meal deals in a massive drab restaurant. A few restaurants cafes were closed so we bought coffee from a stand which was disgusting. If you're a fan of space mountain like me, beware that it's a lot scarier than the Anaheim ride, much faster and goes upside down which I was not aware of and will never quite recover from much to the amusement of my kids. It was great to go to another Disneyland so no regrets there but don't go thinking it will be like Anaheim and although Hong Kong Disneyland is smaller it had great atmosphere and lots of smiling, helpful staff.",Disneyland_Paris

175107483,1,2013-8,Thailand,"As the frequent customers of Disney Parks and admirers of the brand, we were so disappointed with Disneyland Paris. Whilst the facilities were kept clean and in good condition, we were annoyed by so many people smoking. This is probably the only Disney park in the world that allows smokers to freely smoke anywhere inside the park! (I guess they probably lose more money if they don't allow people to smoke?!?) That has spoiled our experience    we simply didn't want to queue up for anything, including the meeting with the characters.The Parks is not big but has most of the usual attractions one would see at other Disney parks. Although it was still during the 20th anniversary celebration, the shows, parades & fireworks were not that extravagant. There were so few shows when we were there.We didn't understand the crowd either    nobody seemed to be considerate of others at all. The people in front didn't bother to sit down to let others in the back see the parades or evening shows fireworks in front of the Castle. No cast members seem to be doing anything. One French guy asked his countrymen politely to sit down but they didn't bother.The only surprise we had was there was no queue for Space Mountain in the evening!Overall, we would rate it only better than Disneyland Hong Kong, which continues to be the bottom of our list of Disney Parks.",Disneyland_Paris
175088464,3,2013-3,United Kingdom,"We've been to Disneyland Paris first time when my older son was only 3 and we definitely enjoyed it and certainly was so magical in the eyes of both children and adults. Then we went to Disneyland California in 2010 and noticed the huge difference in ambience between the two. We visited Disneyland Paris again in March 2013 and couldn't help but compare, DLP lacks the very welcoming smiles of staff, visitors are rude and no disregard for young children, pushing and shoving, some Europeans (not the British) don't know how to queue! if you can ignore all these then I guess it would be ok, plus it's close to England and easy to get to, either by Eurostar or self drive. We will give it another go, probably one last time, and save more for a much better Disney experience in the US after that.",Disneyland_Paris
175076496,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"The most amazing place. However, things you need to know if you are visiting.Things I wish we had known which would have made it better for us and the children.First off all is timescale. You need at least 3 or 4 days at the least. 2 days for each park. The Disney Park and Disney Studios.Disney Park. When you go in get fast passes.This helps go on rides faster without the 1 hour queues.Buying water..3 Euros a bottle!! we took our own in we brought from home packed in suitcases and they never bothered at the checking station before you enter. Bags are scanned so take out cameras and phones.Food is expensive so be well aware of that!! If you are going to scrimp on spending..don't go!!All the shops sell fabulous Disney stuff but again its expensive. I truly think if you are going to Disneyland you need to save up lots so that you enjoy everything and are not disappointed.If you are planning a birthday for a child, wait till you get there and book in at the Mickey Caf   in the Disney Village. This is the area next to the bus shuttle station which is free to get in to.Hotels..... we stayed in the Disney Castle Hotel. Be aware that only the main Disney Hotel, the New York Hotel and The Newport Bay etc in the inner circle of the park have the Disney Characters inside.On the park we saw no characters at all which was disappointing. We had to queue up to visit Mickey Mouse in the Meet Mickey building.The light show and fireworks were at 11pm!!! Get a place to see where you can get the kids high up or they wont see anything. It gets packed with people.Its a mad rush for the shuttle buses at night after the lightshow. Be aware!! like a cattle market! Nobody with any manners whatsoever.The parade, get on the pavement side over an hour early to get your spot or again you wont see it. The Park parade was 7pm whereas in the the Studios it was 5pm.for the Stars and Cars parade. But really worth seeing.We saw the stunt show in the Disney Studios part which is fabulous!! Lightening McQueen makes and appearance too.We went in August and there were a lot of wasps about.Overall we had a great memorable time.Had a day trip to Paris which is wonderful. The train station if you want it is in Disneyland itself!!Next time we will use the Eurostar express for sure from London. We went by coach with Leger and it was a very very very long journey!",Disneyland_Paris
175029037,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"If you've been to the USA Disney parks then you will almost certainly be disappointed with Disneyland Paris. Although a lot of the rides are improved versions of the USA ones, the staff are not as welcoming as in the USA and the place just does not have the same atmosphere. There is a distinct lack of 'Disney Magic' which is present in the American Parks. People smoke anywhere and everywhere, including in lines for young kids' rides like Peter Pan. It is a very expensive holiday and with the high cost of food I would consider paying a bit more and go to somewhere like Florida.",Disneyland_Paris
175026404,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Visited in August, not by design but because we were driving to the Dordogne and thought it would be the most efficient (cheapest!) way to squeeze Disneyland into their childhoods without paying   2k for some sort of package with flights.First off, this place is not easy to find if you are coming from the north. We drove from Calais down the A1 and there were no signposts at all. I tried using online descriptions of how to find it and these were no use at all as the roads seemed to have changed name. Frantic map reading saw us skirting the perimeter fence at CDG airport and edging south via a series of small towns and u turns. Come on Paris, sign this place up!Stayed at the magic circus hotel, which was fine (see separate review). Arrived at the park on a Sunday afternoon at about 2pm. We had a pass for the studios next door too so went to see that first. Long queues for rides that last about a minute   so disappointing, we got on the slinky dog ride after a 40 minute wait. Elder daughter got on the parachute ride after a much shorter queue by going on it alone. Total of two rides then.Saw the animagique show, which was very good but pretty short (20 mins?). Saw a few characters, even our kids didn't recognise some of them. Other kids queuing up for autographs with some sort of book they had purchased in the shop. Spanish kids pushing and shoving.For dinner we ate at the rainforest cafe outside. It was good food (enormous salad!) but hugely overpriced, as was every other cafe. Kids liked the cafe though with its thunder and lightening and general ambience. Over to the disneyland park in time for the 7pm parade. Got there at 6.40 and bagged a good spot just inside the entrance. It's true that people start bagging spots earlier but there's plenty of space. Beware other people muscling in on the place you have saved by pushing their kids forwards. Over enthusiastic Disney staff enforcing rules all along the pavement. Kids with a centimetre of sandal protruding off the pavement urged to move back. Same staff crouching in front of kids and blocking their view. Quite a spectacle in itself. The parade was great. I believe it gets cancelled if it rains. Stayed up for the 11pm dreams show. This was really excellent but hard for the kids to get a good view. Again lots of pushing and shoving. Everyone sits on the pavement waiting for it to begin and then stands up just beforehand. I am sure these problems would be eliminated if it were compulsory to remain seated. Several very thoughtless people in the vicinity including people who arrived at the last minute (one wearing a huge Stetson and completely blocking my daughters view); another with a toddler on her back who pushed in front of me just before her toddler put his foot into my drink. Yes, people really stand that close!Next day we saw sleeping beauty's castle, which was well done. Queued for absolutely ages for the carousel (seriously, queuing for an hour for a standard carousel...come on Disney, this is crap!). 1 hour 15 for the dumbo ride and 1 hour 30 for the train ride. None of the rides was worth the queue. Nothing to entertain the children while waiting, miserable experience.The 'fast pass' system confused me. As an idiots guide   when you enter the park you will be given a fast pass ticket. If you enter in the afternoon there may be none left. The fast pass entitles you to book a slot on a particular ride. So you go to that ride and you enter your fast pass and this gives you a pre arranged time at which you can return and join a much shorter queue. However, once you have done so, you cannot use your fast pass again until that pre arranged ride has been completed.So for example, if you enter at 10.30 and you 'book' a ride for 1.30 2pm then you cannot book another ride until after you've been on this first one. You do not get a choice of time. People booking rides using their fast pass at 1.30pm were being given slots at 9.45pm as these were the first available. This explains why the fast passes run out in the afternoon. The fast pass sounds like a good idea but in August you might only get one ride out of it (as we did   the Peter Pan ride, which was great).Had lunch with the princesses at the auberge. Bill came to    237 for the four of us. Apparently the wine used to be included but it isn't now (I had one glass!). This was by far the best thing about the whole trip. Kids loved it. The adult food was gorgeous but the choice of children's food was strange and includes a salmon mousse starter with no other choice (perhaps French children have more sophisticated palates....mine wouldn't touch this). You really have to book this in advance at peak times. We booked it by phoning disneyland Paris reservations directly. You can hire buggies but I don't think you can take them out of the park. They are basically chairs on shopping trolleys and don't look comfortable. I borrowed one from a friend for our 4 year old but if this had failed I was planning to spend   40 on a second hand one on eBay as it was cheaper than hiring one, more comfortable and I would have been able to take it out of the park.Try the shopping centre up the road for simple food. It's about 10 minutes in the car around the ring road or you can take the train from right outside the park. Beware this centre has height restrictions of 2.1 metres in place, especially around the petrol station. We measured 2.2 m with our top box and were unable to access the petrol station despite asking for help. In all, our children have happy memories of Disneyland Paris but they were ready to leave after lunch and hated the queues. We can say we've done it. We probably won't bother with Florida on the back of this but will take them bear spotting in Yosemite for a fraction of the price instead.",Disneyland_Paris
175003347,5,2013-8,United States,"Paris Disney is a MUST SEE! My boyfriend forced me to go because we have both been ti Disneyland in California many times and he wanted to see the Paris version. It was so worth it! Tons of fun, great rides and great memories! Lines for rides weren't too long and the fast pass really helps things go smoothly. Food is also great at the restaurants that don't require reservations. You can't miss the parade at 7 PM and firework show at 11 PM. Just be careful not to lose your park tickets! The guest relations office was very reluctant to reissue me tickets after mine were stolen while my boyfriend was shooting at the gun range in Adventureland. You can truly feel the magic here!",Disneyland_Paris
174996656,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,Why did we go? We spent a small fortune and we did it on a relatively small budget. Standing for over an hour for a 60 second ride. In a small town fair you could have the same thing for   2 it would last longer and no wait!!! Dreadful food dreadful crowds. Standing in sea of stupidity. I feel ashamed that we bought into this. We do this because of the advertising and peer pressure hype. The emperor's new clothes brought bang up to date !!,Disneyland_Paris
174993363,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"Awwww saw a few  don't expect America  or  it's not as good as Orlando  and felt compelled to defend Disneyland Paris !I've been to both   and to me they're both perfect as they're DISNEY !I don't know how they do it but there's something so magical and wonderful whichever one you're in. So parents if you want the magic but can't afford the USA then you'll still get it here I promise !I think the disneyland park paris and magic kingdom Florida are pretty much like for like. They just need a bigger Hollywood and to build an animal kingdom and Epcot and were good to go us Europeans.Granted, the weather is a little different.....and possibly the staff not as OTT but get your ears on and you won't know the difference!",Disneyland_Paris
174990229,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We are absolutely disgusted with the prices of meals and drinks in Disney, your looking at average prices of   90 for a family of four to eat junk food, cup of coffee seven euro, I am sure this was not the plan when Walt Disney created these parks as they managed now by Dick Turpin as no kettles or Drinking water in the 4 star hotels rooms, and food that costs an arm and a but and unhealthy rubbish, sorry to say this is our last visit to Disney as over priced and hate the fact the Walt Disney dream has changed into a commercial plan to drain your pockets of every penny",Disneyland_Paris
174875325,5,2013-7,United States,"We travelled as a group of 3 adults, 1 teen, 1 child age 5, and a 1 yr old. We booked 6 months in advance through Thomson. As we had to take this trip in school holidays it cost us a fortune just for a 2 night stay (could have got a weeks holiday abroad 4* all inc for what we paid!!) . All the deals advertised on TV just did not work for us as we were not going to stay at Davy Crockett's or spend more money staying another 1 or 2 nights just to try and get a free night stay... Our dates did not coincide with any of Disney's offers which was frustrating, disappointing and misleading! The best offer we got was free hotel & park tickets for the 5 yr old and a free trip overall for the 1 yr old as we didnt have to book a Eurostar seat for her. We were all looking forward to seeing the magic kingdom, especially the 5 yr old who understood she was going to see the castle, princesses,   Micky & Minnie. As adults we had not seen a Disneyland park since we were kids so just walking down Main Sreet again, and seeing the pink castle at the end of it instantly brought those feelings back. We went at the end of July 2013, just at the start of school holidays. Weather was good during the day and not too hot walking around, just about right. We arrived at Marne la Vallee Chessy at 2pm but went via shuttle bus straight to our hotel which was Hotel Santa Fe. The shuttle buses are included in the cost of the trip and are directly opposite the train station. there is a bus every 10 minutes. It takes less than 10 mins to reach this hotel. We needed to freshen up after our 3 hour trip from St Pancras so did not reach the parks until 4pm. As soon as we arrived at Disneyland we headed straight to City Hall. Two of the children in our family group have learning difficulties and are registered to a doctor & paediatrician in the UK. Before travelling to Disney we found out through a friend ( yes, Thomson didn't think to ask us about this when we booked!) that children who are physically disabled or who have various types of behavioural or learning difficulties can apply for a priority pass. We knew that this would really help make our 3 day visit a much easier and better one so we arranged for doctors letters 2 weeks before the trip and then presented these to City Hall staff in order to be granted priority passes for the entire stay. This was an easy process! If you have a child with a disorder, mental illness or other disability I would highly recommend that you pursue seeking an official letter of proof before you travel so that you can ask for a free priority pass (look on Disneyland Paris website for details) This meant that while others had to join lengthy queues on any ride or attraction, the longest queue we had was around 10 minutes. We had 2 of these passes which meant that an adult must accompany each child on a ride (or they can not go on it), and on some rides such as Casey Jr Train or Small World we could all go on as a family if we booked a time slot. The best thrill ride there without a doubt is Space Mountain: Mission 2 in Discoverylsnd. We had trouble with our priority passes on this one for some reason, the young lad on the entry gate didn't believe that the passes we had were ours! Apparently some people were not using them correctly and abused the system just to avoid a queue. After much annoyance we were allowed on the ride. The ride was awesome! I think the passes will eventually be changed to incorporate photo ID. Casey Jr was a pleasant train ride for all the family, Small World was just as I remembered it! We also went on Indiana Jones roller coaster, which is just average and not a lot to do with the actual theme! Big Thunder Mountain is still good! Phantom Manor was dull and I'm glad we did not need to queue for that! We missed Pirates of the Caribbean as we had walked around so much and just didn't know where it was so we lost interest in looking any further.We had a a junk food tea in Casey's Corner, I think it was    15 for a meal deal (ouch!) and still felt hungry afterwards! We only did that because its right on Main St and we wanted to get a good view of the 7pm parade. Everyone lines the street sitting down waiting for the parade and the dumb thing is that when it starts they all stand up ! Meaning that if you are a row behind, you won't get a good view! Luckily we did! The 20th parade was good, lots of characters but not every character you could think of, which is a home as I think there should have been a few more. Opposite Casey's is the Gibson Girl. They do nice sweet things including hot pancakes with cream or ice cream. These were superb!! About    5.99 but I could not resist this treat!On Main St there's loads of places to eat... Loads of places to shop ! The Disney Celebration train also goes by during the day but we never knew the times so we never got to see it properly! As other reviews have said, there are not enough characters walking around, this is kind of true! We did see a few but not enough to stop and take a photo. There were times when there would be one character such as Mickey or Jesse but this of course would draw in a large crowd, no wait your turn system, a bit disorganised! Too many pushy parents! We missed out on Peter Pan's Flight as it was closed when we tried to go on and then we didn't get the chance to try again. The buzz lightyear ride in discovery land was dull, but I guess more for little kids than teens or adults. Autopia was great fun! We went on this the most, about 3 times at least. The 2013 Disney Dreams show is very good (ends in Sep). It is very well executed and gives a great feeling of the Disney magic! But... It is on too late! 11pm is just too late if you have been wandering around all day from 9 or 10am. By the time the show ends there are crowds of people heading towards the gate as the park is closing.. Then you will have to wait for your shuttle bus as everyone has the same idea! Unfortunately the first night we waited to watch the 11pm show it started raining just before the start, this caused hundreds of visitors to leave the outdoor areas such as Main St and panic like it was something worse than a light rain shower! We ended up leaving our good viewing spot for the show, got separated into 2 groups and spent the next hour in shelter and looking out for eachother in the crowds! Missed the Dreams show because of it but you can't help the weather. We watched it the next night but our viewing spot wasn't the best! I'd say overall we had a fab time at Disneyland Paris. Yes, it's expensive in every way but it is a pleasant experience and we would like to go again one day although I think going back to Orlando would be our top choice next. Outside of school holidays is of ourselves best because queues are smaller and prices are lower!",Disneyland_Paris
174829179,3,2012-9,United States,Disney Paris is geared towards European citizens. Food and refreshments are the main differences.The park is not on the same scale as to what you may be familiar with in Florida or California.Perfect for young kids ( 12). Lines are long.It will be disappointing for those who have been to Orlando or Anaheim.,Disneyland_Paris
174829090,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"It took us a long time to save for this holiday and kids and ourselves were super excited after looking at all the advertising etc we went for 5 days and stayed in the New York Hotel. The Hotel was nice, clean and tidy. We really appreciated the free wifi! However, I don't feel staying in a Disney hotel added to the overall experience. There was one character there a day to meet and have your picture with, but at that point we were already in the park.Apart from that there was nothing else to make it special. Breakfast was good with a large selection that pleased both the adults and children. The location to the park is ideal definitely within walking distance.In the park itself the queues were very long, which is to be expected but we did take advantage of the extra 2 hours for hotel guests, this meant the important rides were covered. It was also worth using the fast pass facility which is a brilliant idea.One of the things that really disappointed us were the lack of Disney characters present. Occasionally they appeared in a pre designated place and you had the option to queue to meet them. But they weren't wandering around. My children didn't actually get to meet any characters. Sorry they did meet a princess, in the Disney Princess meet and greet. However, after 40 minutes of queuing for a ticket for this experience we were told the children could only meet one princess and they would have no choice which one. We then had to queue for about another 40 minutes before eventually getting to the front, which was very awkward when my daughter got Belle, a princess she doesn't particularly like. It certainly wasn't worth the overall 1 hour 30 minutes queue time.The parade and evening fireworks are well worth a watch but again be prepared to sit around waiting just so you can secure a descent spot.Unfortunately a lot of the narrative on the rides was in french, so most of the time we had no idea what was going on. I would recommend for any family to take snacks and drinks, as the food is extortionate. We ended up taking a trip to the local super market because it was far far cheaper than eating in the park. We enjoyed most of the rides and in 5 days pretty much covered what we wanted to. The children had fun but by the end were tired of the walking and waiting. Overall I don't feel it was the magical experience they claim, the children spent a lot of time bored because of queues and there was nothing to entertain them. I really wish that we had taken them to Alton Towers for the day and saved ourselves an awful lot of money.",Disneyland_Paris
174826792,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We visited August 24 26 2013, staying at the New York Hotel , Disney Resort.Our two kids aged nearly 5 and 10.We checked in , no problem, booked our restaurants previously using the website telephone number.Room not bad, two double beds, bath and w.c. television and plenty of wardrobe space, our room was 3148 on the 3rd floor.First day after arrival, ten to 15 minute walk to park entrance through Disney village.Went into park and queued for rides for the little one, 30 minutes minimum, went on various fantasy land rides and also the Indiana Jones ride for our 10 yr old.Tried to watch the parade but got pushed from pillar to post by the massing crowds 20 deep!Went to the prebooked Auberge for lunch but decided not to as it was 64Euros adult and 35 for kids!!! so decided to go to Planet Hollywood for lunch, expensive...18 euros for mixed starter for 2 (with 3 of everything??!!)Beer 6.99 euros! coke 4.99.On the evening we went to Inventions restaurant in the Disney Hotel, we had half board plus package and had vouchers for this place.It was nothing special, the food was buffet, a few characters came in, our meal still cost us 90 pounds even though we had half price vouchers!Everything in the park was a disgraceful price, why they need to rip you off is a mystery. Next morning it was raining hard, our hotel allowed us to enter the park at 8 am for 2 hrs before the crowd.We looked at what was open and found this to be unacceptable, 3 rides suitable for our 10 yr old in Discoveryland only and 4  5 rides in Fantasyland for little ones?? Why not open loads more?We were first on Space Mission which is fantastic , we went on 6 times in a row as there were no queues at 8.30 am in the rain!Buzz lightyear riude is ok but tame in comparrison.We went the next morning at 8 am too then you go back to the hotel for breakfast at 10.30 before going back into the park.Brekky in the New York is average in a diner type place.We went on nearly all the rides in both parks, but queued and shuffled for hours!The fastpass is a good idea make sure you use it.We never saw the fireworks as the crowds were 20 deep by 10 pm , with the fireworks at 11!The best rides are:Space Mission 2Rock and Roller Crush's CoasterThunder MountainIndiana JonesThe stunt show at motors is good also.We went to Cafe Mickey for over 100 pounds prebooked, the food was dire, the service dire too, the same characters came in again, i think they do the circuit.The best restaurant for us was the Blue Lagoon , this is inside the Pirates of Carribean ride, atmospher good, service OK, food good and all included in the half board ticket.The cheapest Beer i saw was 6.25 Euros and the dearest 9.50 for Guiness!Take plenty of money, take water bottles and fill at brekky, take snacks, comfy shoes, enjoy if it floats your boat!",Disneyland_Paris
174816262,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"disneyland is a place where the hardened cynic comes away a believer. We had a great time, the staff was smiling, the rides, the parades, the fireworks, everything exceptional. The attention to detail is amazing,Compared to other parks elsewhere, it was outstanding value for money (even though we only went to one park though had access to both).",Disneyland_Paris
174811531,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"How to survive Disneyland Paris and have a fun time...........Its all about timing here, as I discovered very quickly. Queuing is the main culprit to people having a horror story about the place, so my solution to this was to mix it up. Our children (3 & 5) hate queuing, they get fed up, hot and tired and the whole day ends up ruined with a moaning session. I don't think you can do this place with small children in less than 3 days at peak times. We booked for 4 nights 5 days staying in a hotel on site and we saw and did everything we set out to. Yes there was a big bit of queuing involved but if you plan properly the little ones don't notice it too much.The best thing about staying in a hotel on site is you get 2 hours each morning with virtually no queues. So use this time to go on all the rides that get long queuing times (between 8 and 10am) then make use of the fast pass system and get time tickets for those rides that offer them, so when the general public come into the park at 10am you've already got the fast pass to get on those popular rides. So by the time 12 noon came along the children had been on quite a few rides and were ready for lunch. After lunch we took them to see one of the shows, then we either went around the the walk around attractions in the park (Alice's Wonderland maze, Swiss Family Robinson's Treehouse, etc..) or headed back to the hotel for a nap before dinner and Dreams.You need to plan a late night for Dreams as it doesn't take place until 11pm which is quite late for small children and a lot of waiting around in the kerbside. So needless to say we all had a lie in the morning after that! You also need to get a good space for the 7pm parade one night as people start bagging a kerbside seat for that about an hour before, so we used this time for my other half to take the older child on a fast pass ride the little one wasn't allowed on, while we stayed to get a good seat for the parade. Get a park map and plan out which rides your kids really want to go on and make a beeline for those at the start of the day, then mix it up with the walkaround's and shows and try not to rise to the 'queue jumpers'! And also big tip with little ones, make a toilet trip often even though they say they don't need it, as last thing you want is you getting to the front of the queue only for a small voice saying  mummy I want a wee wee! The highlights for our children were Dreams and the parade but you only need to do these once, so plan in advance and get a good seat. If you go for less than 3 days in peak time, don't expect to see and do everything Disneyland has to offer, you just won't fit it all in as the queues are horrendous and the park is so massive.",Disneyland_Paris
174733777,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"In short, massively disappointing. We spent about 7 hours there today (a Thursday in late august 2013) I would say over 6hrs of it was spent in one queue or another   long queues to get in, for food, the rides, the shows, even to get out. On arrival, was really looking forward to it, my children were bubbling over with excitement. With most of the attractions we took one look at the hundreds of people in the queue and didn't bother. We went on 3 rides all day, which my 2 kids liked whilst they lasted (about 5 mins). Im sorry Disney, but you cannot expect young children to wait around in a queue for an hour. My wife had to queue for over an hour for a few MacDonalds type overpriced cheeseburgers. There really is nowhere to buy food that is decent (I expected inflated food prices so didn't mind that too much). To rub salt in the wounds our 2 day pass cost us Euro404   a huge cost for a very disappointing experience. I would liken it to paying   20 an hour for the privilege of queuing with a mass of humanity   at one point I formed the view that waiting in line with bored, fractitious children at heathrow was better than this, at least at heathrow you weren't paying for it! After the disaster with Disneyland itself, we decided to give the neighbouring Studios a try, with a show. Sold out. We gave up at this point. For my taste, there is not enough in the way of characters walking around, and too much in the way of shops and trying to sell you overpriced tat. As my mind wandered in the day (and my spirits slowly deflated, from optimism, to resignation, to frustration, finally to exhaustion and  get me out of here  claustrophobia) I felt a rising disillusionment with in your face global branding consumerism. Speaking personally, I could not wait to get out of the place (even had to queue for that for half an hour). As my wife said at the end LEGOLAND Windsor was better than that. Summed it up really. The worst of it is, as I write this, I have to go back tomorrow, as we booked a 2 day pass! Urgghhhh! Seriously, I wouldn't bother. Disney, get your act together please   this place is truly awful.

174691150,3,2013-8,United States,"if you're European I can see how it would be appealing. You just can't beat the parks in Anaheim and Orlando. They have done a decent job trying to make it very much like a combination of both of the American parks on a smaller scale. The lines are pretty long and the rides are about the same as the ones in the USA. The Space Mountain Mission 2 ride was disappointing. I think the original is much better even though the new ride does take you upside down. What did stink was that the height requirements for a lot of the rides were a lot more strict than in the USA.As an American, I'd skip it. If you're a European who has never visited a Disney Park in the States, you will likely enjoy it a lot.",Disneyland_Paris
174674996,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Arrival:We arrived at about 8:15 Monday, using the Disney hours. Went straight through the entrance to the right of the park easily   no queues. Rides:(Doesn't compare with Florida at all, but for our kids aged 7 and 5 this park was a perfect size to manage). Went upstairs in the castle to see the fairy stories and the view. Then on the Carousel (5 min wait), Dumbo ride (15 min) and tea cups (10). We then did It's a small world and did it twice as there was no queue! We then went to Pirates of the C ride and queued for about 25 mins. It was about 10:15 when we came out of P of the C and you could then tell the difference in crowd numbers with it being open to everyone.Huge volumes of people, but it was a Monday and a bit rainy so I think it may have been less busy than other days! We managed to do all rides in one day and even did P of the C twice, although the queue the second time was about 45 mins (all bar Thunder and Space mountain due to our children not being tall enough) Our favourite was Buzz Lightyear   we queued about 60 mins.Kids enjoyed all of the rides no question. I found some were rushed e.g. Pinocchio, Snow White you are whirled around and it seems such a shame as you only catch a quick glimpse of the scenes which look so well made and lovely. I would rather wait in the queue a bit longer and have the ride extended for a few further minutes to make it worth it.We didn't experience any of the pushing mentioned in other queues   it all seemed orderly.The staff weren't in your face   have a nice day, happy like in Florida, but they were all pleasant enough and polite and making the effort to say how many there are of you in French and please and thank you etc goes a long way.Parade:Was at 7:00   we got there at about ten to and were about 5 rows from the front in the Main Disney Street where the parade ends. Parade was ok   short in comparison to Florida and started at about 7:20. On the second day we didn't bother with the parade, preferring to take advantage of shorter queues, and we did notice that it would have been better to have watched the parade from the Fantasyland end where it starts as there were less people, more places to stand up higher for a view, and of course if it is running late, at least you have less of a wait.Fireworks at park close:We thought the fireworks would start at about ten   but it was about 11:15! We sat on the floor slightly to the left of the castle as you look at it and had got there at about ten to ten. Most people seem to fill the main street and had been there from much earlier on. Most rides are shut so why can't they start it earlier? Disney is for kids (mostly) and by 11:15 ours (7 and 5) were asleep in our arms and looking around, we were surrounded by kids who had done the same, or those who were screaming to go back to the hotel as they were so tired and it ruined the evening for some you could tell. It's such a magical thing to watch and it was spectacular, but I wish it could be earlier in the evening as it was dark by about 9...they could open the rides again afterwards.Toilets:Important to us with two young kids   the need to make sure they have gone before you join a big queue was vital and we found lots of toilets throughout the park and they were clean.Food:We brought lots of snacks (things that wouldn't melt!) from home to avoid queues at snack bars when we could be in a queue for a ride. We also saved a huge amount of money by doing this as it is of course theme park rates for food and drink. This certainly allowed us to do more rides in a shorter space of time and keep the kids and us sane! They could nibble on snacks in queues meaning that we went from 8:15 until 5:30 with toilet stops only. We took a bottle of juice cordial in our bag and a few empty bottles and used the many water fountains outside the park or inside the park to make up squash throughout the day. Again this meant we could avoid OTT prices and fizzy drink options and meant we could keep thirst at bay throughout the day without queuing.We ate at about 5:30 on both days, the Rainforest Cafe (expensive and food only ok) and the Earl of Sandwich (good for quick service and a lot calmer than McD's) where the food was nice and we sat for about 40 mins for a break.",Disneyland_Paris

Mad hatters tea cups 5 mins. we where the first to start queing for mickeys meet and greet at 9.20am yes it doesnt open till 10.30 but we where first in at 9.40 the que was starting to go around dumbo. my boys loved meeting mickey. We got out at 10.55 and went straight on its a small world it said 30mins but within 5 minutes we where on. By 11.30 it was packed with ques between 60 100minutes. so we went on the railroad on main street which was a 20minute que. a great ride for looking around the park. If recommend a late lunch in the village no big ques and nice slow pace we went to annettes diner which was nice served straight away. id recommend going having a rest or a nap if you have little ones. we went back at 6.50 and waited until the parade had passed its a good time to go on rides as everyone goes for food after the parade their was a huge amount of people going into the village we waited 15mins to go on phantom manor. for pirates of the carribean go when its dark as theirs hardly any ques. a very nice park with lots to do including 2 play parks in frontierland and adventureland,Disneyland_Paris

174633195,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Overall we had a brilliant short family break here, we are a group of 2 adults and 2 children aged 6 & 4. Here are my tips for a good day;Fantasyland is aimed at smaller children (under 7s) so if you have small children I would plan to spend most of your day here.You will walk for miles, wear very comfy shoes!Take your own water bottle and picnic...the food is poor and very expensive (there are lockers at the park entrance to store your picnic until later).Queues are long and people try and push in front of you so you need to be very firm!There are not enough toilets and the queues are also very long...they are dirty and smelly so be warned.The Disney Dreams show is amazing, but you need to get a good spot right in front of the castle and it starts to fill up two hours before the show starts! Take a picnic blanket as there are not many places to sit down.Walts is an excellent place to eat, good quality food.The shops are brilliant...much better quality than I expected, take your credit card.The parade is also very good, but the route starts to fill up an hour ahead of the start time.There are not many characters around...you need to book a meal at Cafe Mickey to meet them and get photos.Have a great time!",Disneyland_Paris
174623013,2,2013-8,Romania,"This was our third visit, with teen kids and it was a very bad experience. August is the worst time to go, waaaaay too crowded!! Some rides had up to 120min wait time, which puts you off big time.Apparently, if you want to enjoy what's left of the park, you should avoid 15th of May to 15th of October, but then it's probably colder.All the prices went up A LOT in the last 3 years since our last visit, like an average T shirt from 9 10 Euros to 25 30 Euros.",Disneyland_Paris
174621733,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We had a great day at Disneyland, our kids were mesmerised by some of the attractions. I will never forget my 3 year old daughter's reaction to 'It's a small world' and 'Pirates of the Carribean'. Not much to add to previous reviews other than to confirm it is superbly done throughout, the quality of the rides, the theming, the attitude of the staff etc is just on a completely different level to any UK theme park. The proof of this has to be that as adults, we personally enjoyed every one of the rides that we took our 3 & 6 year olds on. At UK theme parks the kiddie rides leave us bored to tears and weary. At Disneyland you can really feel like a kid again at times.Queues were long, but the fast track system works pretty good if you get yourself organised. We managed to get on at least 10 of the top rides on one of the busiest days of the year. The only real problem was 'Autopia' which we got in the queue for late evening when it looked at it's lowest point. It was moving OK but then completely ground to a halt. We could see that some of the cars had staff members going round and round instead of punters. I asked one of the staff what was going on and they said they had closed down two of the lanes as it was the end of the day. There was no announcement and it was impossible to tell how long we'd have to wait, so we bailed out   an annoying waste of 30 minutes.I'm not sure how, but we managed to keep our kids going all the way through to 11pm for the Disney Dreams show which was absolutely spectacular, although marred on our night (typical) by problems with the sound for the first half of the show. The soundtrack was barely audible and if they hadn't fixed it when they did it would have ruined the show and the whole day out.We visited in a motorhome and this is a great way to do the park if you can...just drive down from the ferry, get in the line of campervans outside the gate the night before and bed down, then drive in first thing to the campervan car park (30 euros!). From there it's a ten minute walk to the gate, and the van is waiting for a good night's sleep when you've finished.Yes it's expensive, everything is overpriced, the food is pretty poor   but given the quality of the rides and the spectacular shows they run day in day out, I can't complain too much.A 4 star review due to the Autopia queue and Dreams show sound problems, plus they should also improve the food and provide more shaded grassy areas for chilling out.",Disneyland_Paris
174619760,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"We have been going to Disney Paris almost every second year for the past 10 years and it was only this year that I discovered that there are concession and assistance for disabled and infirm   which I could not easily find on their website!!.I have always booked via the disney site as we always stay at a hotel on site or the Explorers( which is great!!) I came across information for disabled visitors thru the Mumsnet site. A disabled visitor gets a discounted price and their carer gets in FREE also available are quick passes so that you bypass the waiting crowds to get on attractions and front row seats at the shows etc.So here;s what you need to do   DONT buy you tickets before you go. Organise your hotel and travel then when you get to the park go passed the queues waiting to buy tickets, go round to the left there is a disabled ticket window or ask a staff member to direct you to disable ticket window. If you have a Blue Badge for disabled parking, take this with you (we also took our passports and hotel confirmation as we needed 3 day tickets) or take some sort of GP letter or notice of disabled registration. You buy the disabled ticket and you get the carer ticket for free. I am a blue badge holder and so is my MUM (82 years old and still loves disney) so we got 2 discounted disabled passes and 2 free passes for my 2 daughters 22 & 18, but remember your child can also be your carer as many children are in this position!. These passes are the same as everyone else paying in full price so there are no restriction just because your a disabled visitor. THEN when you go into the park go straight to the City Halls   on the left, and get the passes that allow you AND upto 4 other people to bypass the queues at most of the attractions. At the attractions, just follow the disabled sign or go to the exit of the attraction as this is where the fast route usually is or ask the staff member to show you where the disable queue is. The longest we waited to get on a ride was about 15 minutes. The disbaled person is supposed to be with the carers but my teenagers were able to bypass the queus on some rides that I didnt fancy without me, by just taking the passes themselves. My name was on the pass and I was meant to be there but there is no photograph or anything to show that it was not my daughters pass  OK i know this is naughty but it would have meant me standing around for over an hour waiting for them to get on and off the ride which would have left me in pain as I am unable to stand for too long. Some of the rides state you must be able to go down emergency stairs if needed i.e the peterpan ride, but if your able to get down stairs or the disbaled person is a child that can be carried then you should be able to go on everything. Hope this help many people to save some cash and enjoy the magic!!",Disneyland_Paris
174560741,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Disney Paris is pretty amazing, and it has some fantastic rides, so much going on everywhere, so many shops, places to eat and so much to see..... but during the height of the Summer season, you really have to be prepared for the crowds and queues!! And believe me, they are EVERYWHERE! That said, it does leave you with some great memories, but you really do have to make the most of being there, especially if you're doing a whistle stop tour of 4 days like we did. Make sure you get the fast pass & early entry package, so you can get into the Park at 8am (and start queuing for rides that don't open til 10am, and no I'm not kidding!), and fast passes might be worth getting, although it turns out there are hardly any rides that offer fast pass, and the queues for fast pass were sometimes longer than the normal queues, so you don't really gain that much! But the rides I managed to get on were pretty good it must be said. Buzz Lightyear is fantastic fun, especially when you win against your 7yr old nephew like I did!! :)) And I got talked into The Tower of Terror, and my god it is a Tower full of terror, I've never screamed so much LOL. But when you eventually calm down and your legs are not so jelly like anymore, its really funny to stand and watch from the bottom and see the next lot of people on the ride, at the top screaming their heads off! Great fun, and my nephew's favourite ride out of all of them believe it or not   he has nerves of steel!!!! A must is Small Small World.... it's just a tradition, and you will never get that damn song out of your head again! Toy Story Parachute ride was surprisingly scary! Takes you quite high up and then you drop quickly..... with your legs dangling down, I wasn't really expecting to feel quite so vulnerable! And nephew wasn't all that happy being on it.... was quite surprised given that he loved Tower of Terror, but I think it was the  sense of openness  that made him feel more scared. So just a heads up on that one if you're taking younger ones. Crush's Coaster   this ride looked amazing, and was definitely the most popular. Queues were   1hr 30mins every day, so we ended up missing out unfortunately, as there just wasn't enough time to get on everything and 7yr old was getting fed up of queuing. If you're prepared to queue, definitely a must. Tram Tour with special effects is brilliant and really has everyone on the edge of their seat :)) Star Tours   feedback from nephew was great fun although sometimes a bit scary but still fun. Finally, the hard core members of our troop (my 14yr old niece and believe it or not, my 70 yr old dad!) tried and tested Space Mountain and Thunder Mountain. Space Mountain   feedback was something along the lines of  never again  and  omg that was so violent !! It shakes you about, spins you upside down and basically scares the hell out of you whilst speeding up and down in the dark! Thunder Mountain... more bearable, but a small train on a small track with a top speed of 24mph apparently! Twists and turns along a rickety rackety old track! Hold onto your hats and little ones!!As for the eateries around the park   I love the village part of the park, it's just got a great feel to it, however, it's quite a shock when you walk into most of these places, as they look so classic and quaint from the outside, but essentially all they are inside is a fast food joint. You are as good as getting a Maccy Ds for lunch, most of them just have  meal deals  and boy do you pay a lot for the privilege! On the back of that though, some of the restaurants for dinner are brilliant. I would recommend you go on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride (which is great fun!), and then give the Blue Lagoon restaurant a go afterwards (you'll need to book for every restaurant in advance btw!). The service was little bit slow to begin with, but the food was brilliant! And you sit next to the  lagoon  and see people go past on the ride!! :) Caf   Mickey is a must   probably best for breakfast or lunch. You need to book for this, as it's the main attraction for dining, as all the characters will come and join you at your table! :))We stayed at Hotel New York, which is a 5min walk from the Park, so perfect. We've stayed there before (10 years ago). I was hoping it might have had a big refurb, especially given it's the 20yr anniversary, but sadly it didn't seem so. Still a nice hotel though, just a shame they felt the need to do some refurbishment of the New York bar whilst we were there   my dad was particularly annoyed at that! Not ideal given it was August and packed! But we did at least manage to get in there one evening. I would recommend giving yourself plenty of time to have a mooch round the rest of the park too, not just the rides and shops. There are some great things to see   for instance have a walk up through the big Fairytale castle, the kids will love it. And look out for the mini parade that appears throughout the day with Mickey and Minnie and the crew on a small float. Plus there is the standard parade through the whole park at 7pm every evening with all the characters and amazing floats, along with a (very) late night Disney Dreams show outside the castle with fireworks and water fountains. Apparently it's an amazing show, but sadly we missed it due to it being so late starting   the kids couldn't cope with a 7am start and then waiting around until 11pm for the fireworks (a tad late I thought for kids?!).All in all a really good place, and you will make some great memories there, but you will also be frazzled by the end of it and will need a relaxing beach holiday to recover!! ;)",Disneyland_Paris
174514737,4,2013-5,Brazil,"I was there in past may; unfortunately it was a very cold and rainy day, what was quite disappointing, because the most interesting attractions are not good in such conditions and some of them even close under raining. In general, very nice and cool place to go with a family, and do not forget to bring your food, because everything there is quite expensive.",Disneyland_Paris
174508369,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Went to DLP for 4 nights 5 days. Have been before in 2000 and 2004. Last year we went to Florida. Although in some ways it is unfair to compare the two, you just cant help it, because Florida is right up there on the magic scales.DLP is great for a short break if you aren't lucky enough to get to Florida. The problems are the queue jumpers(all other nations not British), serious lack of manners in general, long queues, smoking in the park, and a serious lack of character availability. It just ruins Disney.On arrival we headed straight for the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, the queue nearly an hour long, so frustrating to see families pushing in the queue. I don't understand why this cant be addressed by Disney as its a serious problem.Nothing worse than smoking and it is riff in the park with dog ends everywhere. I don't want to breathe someone's fag's smoke and neither does my DD. The park is expensive to eat with the food quality poor. See my other honest reviews. Hard to believe that France is meant to be the culinary capital of the world! The only characters we saw was when they came off the 20th anniversary train and then it was a mad scrum. Eventually I booked Caf   Mickey to guarantee some character interaction. We also met several characters at our Disney Hotel. When you do meet them they are outstanding, its just a shame they aren't around the park like in Florida. Didn't once see a Princess...you have to queue to get a ticket by the Old Mill.The queues were relatively long but we had magic hours so arrived early enough to avoid the madness. You have to expect queues and you cant expect to do all the rides on a day trip 1 day.Dreams was brilliant but at 11pm its a late show,also the immediate area is crowded by 9.30pm with everyone sitting on the floor trying to get the best spot. We gave up one night as by 10.30pm my DD was too tired, and it was hard to manovere back to the hotel but surprisingly we had some help from a French family. Dreams is definitely worth watching but be prepared to fight for your viewing spot. So yes we had a lovely time its exhausting, but seeing my DD smiling its worth it. But Disney need to sort out these other issues, but seeing as it was the same in 2004 its looking doubtful that they really want the Disney magic at Disneyland Paris!!",Disneyland_Paris
174502092,1,2013-6,United States,Targeted at young children and not many rides for older guests. Staff really need to brush up on their English skills and the food is awful. I really wouldn't advise visiting as its a waste of money.,Disneyland_Paris
174472820,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"After returning from our holiday I would like to express my concerns about my family's experience.Both parks were both dangerously overpopulated resulting in queue times of over 30 mins for the bag check alone, over an hour for the rides and 30 minute queues for food outlets. I can only imagine the chaos if there was an accident and they needed to be vacated in an emergency.The staff were pretty much non existent and those that were available, gave the impression of being harassed and only able to spare a few seconds.The Disney characters who are apparently available at most times for children to greet are only available for 10 minutes with no forethought given to arrange a line for small children to have a picture taken so a mass scramble by adults ensues so no children get their picture taken, we tried to see 5 x characters in 2 days (Minnie Mouse on 3 occasions) and were unable to get anywhere near them resulting in both of my daughters in tears as this was the main thing that they were looking forward to.We managed to bump into a couple of characters whilst walking around the park and when asked if they could stop for a photo opportunity, my children were gently pushed to one side on both occasions leaving us with some awkward questions as to why the characters are ignoring them!The fast pass option is for a selected number of rides, most of them not being suitable for young children.Overall we are extremely disappointed with our stay, the Disney magic that I promised my children has been ruined, the experience is not as advertised and we will not be returning, nor will we be recommending the trip to anyone.",Disneyland_Paris

The queue times weren't as long as I expected and for being a theme park, the prices in my opinion weren't outrageous. I'd definitely recommend staying at a Disney resort if you go, due to the fact that you get into the park and can ride earlier than those who aren't staying on a resort. The only complaint I have about the whole experience was in regards to the light up fireworks event we attended. There weren't handicap platforms to elevate wheelchair bound attendees for better viewing, and there wasn't a safe way to exit mid show in case of emergency. A simple roped off aisle way through the center of the downtown area would make anyone in need of medical attention, reachable and at the moment, in my opinion, the whole event is extremely dangerous.",Disneyland_Paris

174318223,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I have just written a review of the Disneyland Paris Studios which seems to be where all the money is going at the moment from a development point of view. Having not visited Disneyland for 6 years and now visiting with teenage children we were hoping the magic had remained in tact. To be fair it has and I don't have a bad word to say about this place as its brilliant! Anyone visiting for the first time would not notice the cut backs on shows and parades since the last time we visited. Sadly missing this year was the night time illuminated parade which always came before the fireworks, replaced with a rather spectacular effects show projected on to the castle which appealed to our older children but might have been lost on some of the younger ones. Also very obvious in its absence was the extraordinary Tarzan show which was a shame and nothing replaced it from what we could see. Likewise with the Lion King show which used to happen daily in Videopolis and was replaced this year by touring brass bands, not quite the same when you are having your pizza lunch. On the subject of food, its expensive but serves the purpose. You should enter a place like Disney with no thoughts of budget, I read someone else wrote 'leave the budget at home', I completely agree!All that said the rides are as amazing as ever, the 20th Year Parade was excellent and we all had an amazing time! My one tip if you are staying in one of the Disney hotels would be get the breakfast in the Park offer! To get it make sure you check in early as there are a limited number available and ask for it during check in. So happy 20th Disneyland Paris and hope to see you again real soon...",Disneyland_Paris
174315541,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Just back after a lovely visit to Disneyland Paris. Very busy attraction (if you dont mind being trodden on and bashed with prams, rucksacks and umbrellas). My kids really enjoyed it which is the main thing. A few places I had researched where to eat were not open ie Buzzlight years pizza planet restaurant and Pizzeria Bella notte but we found a lovely pizza place in Frontierland called Colonel Hathis Pizza Outpost, quite reasonable and very yummy. Makes a change from all the burger places. Mcdonalds is far too busy and couldnt get a seat. Average waiting time for rides was about 35 40 mins which was not bad as it goes quicker than you think. We stayed at Hotel Santa Fe just a short shuttle ride away from the park. Will definitely go again but will be prepared.",Disneyland_Paris
174311784,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We visited DLP over 4 days in August 2013 with 3 boys aged 14, 12 and 5. The boys enjoyed the rides immensely although due to time constraints caused by long queues we didn't quite manage to get on all the ones they wanted to.The whole experience was hard work as the park opens at 10am and closes at 11pm, and at this time of year the queues are long for every ride. Expect to walk long distances, and be on your feet a lot. The advertised wait times are consistently over 60 minutes (and occasionally 2 hours !) for most of the popular rides, and we discovered that the advertised times were a guide only as often we had to wait even longer.With hindsight we could have had a more productive visit if we had planned our days out with military precision and used the fast pass system more.The other shock to the system was the price of everything. Over 3 Euro for a bottle of coke and a hot dog costs nearly 7 Euro. We at at a couple of restaurants in Disney Village and it works out at around 35 Euro a head for a main course, dessert plus a soft drink. With a bit of planning you could get stuff cheaper from the supermarket and take it in but technically, you aren't supposed to take picnics in with you and we were on holiday so opted to buy food on site.Stayed at Davy Crocketts ranch which absolutely fine, only about 10 mins away from the DLP site.Overall, we felt the sheer number of people they let into the park really lets it down. It means the queues are allowed to get ridiculously long and the cleanliness of the park suffers (e.g. the toilets are a disgrace). Also be warned that you won't see many characters in the park unless you queue at the designated places, and that despite the no smoking policy, loads of people ignore it and puff away in open spaces and occasionally, in the line for the ride ! We last visited in May 2006 and at that time of year it was much less busy and a much more enjoyable experience.",Disneyland_Paris

Each day before 1000 there was very few people about and worst of all a very limited number of areas open which included the rides for getting fast passes where applicable. I felt sorry especially for the 'little ones'. The other dissapointment was at the 2300 Thursday Light Show there was no sound for about 75% of the performance on our side of the park and limited sound on the other side. As spectacuar as it was, the sound was barely audible which took the shine off the whole event that night.

174283368,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Maybe it's because without the aid of young children the Disneyland Experience is like Marmite, you either love it or hate it. Well maybe hate is to strong a word. We sytayed for 4 nights and 5 days and after day 3 i would have been happy to jump on the train and go back home. All the big rides done, some of the small rides done and the wallet was nearly empty through the expence of being in the Disney bubble. If you have young children the appeal is the Disney characters and processions. We took a 10, 12 and 15 year old and the interest in processions, Disney characters was further back than going on all the thrill rides and watching the stunt shows. Tower of Terror, Areosmiths Roller costers, Space mountain, Thunder mountain and Star Tours were much more favoured over chasing characters for a picture or seeing a prade. I have now been to Disney Florida and Paris and would rate the lay out of the Paris better, not as many parks but the Disney Village, Studios and main park are all right next to each other. The cost for eating is way to much, the maintenance on some of the rides   a little less impressive than the Amercian counter parts (Aerosmith Rock n Rolla is not half as impressive when it doesn't have the music playing for several days). We stayed at one of the Hotels recomended by Disney with the free shuttle bus (you are now captured in the Disney bubble), with the hotel swimming pool and ball pool on offer the kids spent hour playing in these each evening, All that said we had a nice time, but wouldn't do it again (couldn't afford it).",Disneyland_Paris

I was genuinely horrified to see vegetation growing out of the exhibits on the Studio tour and it gave me a sense of no one really caring about the park and being more worried about the profit margin rather than the user experience. Rides kept breaking down, staff were friendly enough on the park but aggressive and thoughtless in the hotel.

174264188,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I visited Disneyland Paris with my family (teenage daughter and 9 year old son) on a stopover visit to Paris last week. I experienced the worst day out at an establishment that is run by people who obviously do not understand the brand they are trying to sell; and that's what it is   a sales trick. At Disneyland Paris I found some (mostly malfunctioning) adventure rides positioned as an enticement to the biggest retail space in Paris. Disneyland Paris is not about fun rides, it's about spending your currency in Disney outlets. The rides don't work   we arrived at a ridiculously crowded park last week and spent the whole day there (10am   11.45pm). Having paid over   200 for tickets to gain admission we queued for 6 different rides during the day; four of which either broke down before we could get on them or broke down while we were on and had to be evacuated. My 9 year old son was evacuated from two of his favourite Disney 'story' rides through backstage areas featuring trash bins and service vehicles   in his words  the magic died  that day and so did my interest in anything to do with Disney. The irony of it all was that while we were sat on broken down rides the PA speakers were pumping out messages about the Disney magical fantasy experience spanning 20 years! The only highlight of the day was the Buffalo Bill Wild West show which I took the .children to in the evening to make up for a ruined day out   costing me another   200 for the show but at least it was worth it   well run and friendly service, good food and some great cowboy action. An enjoyable fantasy.So in conclusion buyer beware; if you want fun adventure rides that work and represent value for the money you pay to get in   then stay well away from Disneyland Paris or run the risk of experiencing a day like ours. Go to a fun rides park instead.",Disneyland_Paris

174198381,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We have two young children aged 2 & 4. Our kids had a great time. Yes there were some things that were not perfect. Some rides were out of action for short periods, it was very busy and very expensive and some staff could be more helpful but if you want peace and quiet and cheap you should not be going to disneyland.There was a lot of long ques for rides so you should definately plan your day and make use of the fast pass. We went for 5 nights which was good with young children as we felt we did not have to rush and try and cram everything in a couple of days.A few tips. We ate at cafe mickey. The kids loved this. Some characters come out during the meal and visit each table individually and will sign autographs and take pictures. You have to book but this is definately worth doing as there is a lack of characters in the park, and when there is one in the park there were long clues to see them.Drinks in the parks are very expensive and when it is hot you can spend a fortune. There are water fountains dotted around. Take a bottle and refil it. I also took a trip on the paris underground which is right out side the parks. If you go one stop there is a huge shopping centre and super market. I picked up soft drinks (and beers for the hotel) at a fraction of the price.The disney dreams show that is on in the main park is well worth a watch. It was annoying that no one appeared to know when it actually started. We got there about 9.30 and it eventually started at 11pm. It is spectacular though.Overall we felt it was worth the trip. It is long tiring days but good fun if you enter into the spirit of it and forget that you are being charged premium prices. I do feel that if you have the choice florida is the better option as there are more parks are more attractions eg seaworld, kennedy space centre and i did feel that everyone in florida was more friendly and helpful, but disney land paris is worth a visit.",Disneyland_Paris
174083102,5,2012-10,Norway,"Where to begin? This place took my breath away, you can almost feel the magic as you walk through the main entrance. It was kind of overwhelming to finally see this place I had dreamed of for years. The park is HUGE, and I recommend having at least 3 days here, to have time to see everything. You can meet all kinds of Disney characters here, and not two days are alike. The rides are great, and some of them are among the best and most exciting rollercoasters I have been in. There is something for all ages here. The only problem is it may be too overcrowded, and the wait times are crazy at some of the more popular attractions. This was when I visited in october, so I can only imagine how it is during the most busy months.As mentioned, the park is enormous, so wear good shoes and be prepared for alot of walking. Also, be sure to see the daily parade, and the nighttime Disney Dreams show, they are amazing.",Disneyland_Paris
174068535,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We decided to take the family to Paris but rather than staying in a hotel, we used Disneyland as a base. Second time that we have stayed in the Explorers hotel at Disneyland and although noisy at times, was a good choice. Good swimming pool. Brilliant breakfast and large rooms. We had one with a separate bedroom attached because we were a party of five so the extra bunk beds were handy. It is really easy to travel into Paris (40 minutes) by train and we spent two days there and saw all the sights and included a visit to the Louvre.Disneyland was very, very busy with queues for rides with a wait of up to one and a quarter hours for some. However, we found that if we waited until 9.30 in the evening most rides were fairly empty because people were sitting down to see the firework show and we even managed to go on Small World three times in a row. There are also free fast track tickets for some rides   just get a ticket from the machine and it gives you a time for your turn.Just be prepared to go on a diet when you go home because all the take a ways are 'fast food' unless you have a fortune to spend in the better restaurants! The New York Deli in the Village has a slightly better menu.",Disneyland_Paris

It's good for children and adults. Recomended",Disneyland_Paris
174025596,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from a 4 day stay at DLP with our 4 children aged 5, 10 and 14. Not one to ever write reviews, I am totally appalled by the lack of so called 'magic' Disney Land Paris has to offer. There is a no smoking policy, however NO ONE adheres to it. You can be stood in a queue 250 people deep full of people smoking, happily puffing smoke into your children's lungs... regardless of the fact that you are outside, DLP stinks of cigarettes! Not to mention armpits... due to the fact that people are expected to wait around for hours on end in the heat queueing for a ride that only lasts between 1 and 2 minutes. Hardly the magical fairy tale land you are led to believe it is!As for the toilets... can they not afford a cleaner? Our first impressions of DLP were the toilets at the entrance and I can honestly say they were filthy and the stench of urine was enough to make you feel sick. So on top of the stench of armpits, urine and cigarettes nearly every ride we attempted to go on was broken. The Rockin Roller Coaster, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, Pirates Of The Carribbean.... in fact we got stuck half way through our Pirates Of The Caribbean ride on quite a steep slope in the dark which frightened our girls.... only to be left there for 20 minutes! When we were eventually evacuated from the building via the fire escape! Did we get an apology? Of course not. You will wait for hours for your ride.... and if your little girl wants to see a Princess they no longer just walk around the park... you have to get in line and queue for a couple of hours. Its handwork to say the least, however this was peak season. On positive note the parades are very good as is the light show at the end.Our accommodation was clean, we were a party of 6 so we had to stay in Davey Crocketts Ranch. Ask for a new cabin on arrival if you can, they are much better than the older ones! On arrival the reception staff were a little moody.... not what you would expect from Disney. So all in all Disney's motto is  Do you believe in Magic  my answer is NO! A shocking waste of money! Bring in on the spot smoking fines for all those ignorant smokers polluting the lungs of small children! Clean up the on site toilets, ensure your rides are up to the 1000's of disappointed tourists they endure each day! Shame on you Disney Land Paris!",Disneyland_Paris
174022403,2,2013-8,United States,"If you have been to Disneyland, Florida this resort will not even come close in comparison. The queues are crazy with unrealistic waiting times displayed. There wasn't a single thing that we didn't queue for, rides, food, toilets, etc. The magic experience that is so important in America is lacking here. Over hour long queues for a two minute photo opportunity with the Disney characters for my little boy, whereas in Florida they are regularly around the parks.  We queued for well over an hour for the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, which then broke down and left us sat on it for 30 minutes with promises of it being running again shortly. Eventually we were evacuated with not a single word of apology, let alone anything complimentary as a gesture of goodwill!We had a two day break with a park hopper ticket and on the day we were in the Disneyland Park managed approx three rides. We had to leave a queue to meet Mickey Mouse with one very disappointed little boy having waited for 30 minutes with the queue not moving. Dinner took an hour and a half, having waited for food, then having to sit on the floor to start off, eventually managing to grab a dirty vacated table. This place is so over crowded, commercial and lacks the resources and customer experience!",Disneyland_Paris
173995032,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I had been to Disneyland Paris many years ago on a school trip and had decided to take my children now they are 7 and 9. I grew sceptical as the date grew closer as the thought of wandering around in the heat...stories of French people barging in front of queues, over priced food, queues etc started to make me think that I had made a mistake.We stayed in Davy Crocket Ranch which was perfect. Very clean and looked brand new. It allowed our kids to go to bed (which they do quite early) whilst the adults could stay up and share the odd glass of vino!We opted for the half board package and also because staying at the hotels we could visit the parks early...we did and had a great time.We went on some of the popular rides early and had to wait about 10 mins. The place is magical and adults and children had a fantastic time. My children said  it was the best holiday ever .We loved the parade at 7pm.The French were courteous and there were smiles all round...Great holiday.",Disneyland_Paris
173993748,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"loved it and have to admit the castle is much better than the one at Florida!however! it is so much more expensive than America the parades and Disney dreams show is fab even if its on a bit late 11 really is late for little ones, if you want to get any kind of a decent view get a spot on the curb an hour before the parade and we sat infront of the castle for the Disney dreams show 2HOURS before it started! its madness people just start sitting down at 9 the rides are brilliant esp for little ones my 5 year old could pretty much go on everything however there was a few rides my 3 year old missed out on.food and drink is again expensive but its paris I get it.either way great holiday we were there from tues to sat and id had enough id say 2 nights 3 days is perfect!",Disneyland_Paris

173931699,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"2nd visit in the past few years and still just as magical as the first time, watching the 20th anniversary celebrations   parades and castle show and fireworks   were amazing, tear inducing! So much to do and see make sure you book several days at least 3 I'd say to cover everything the rides are clearly labelled as to who they are suitable for and for the first time we went on the small world ride...wow...the animatronics were amazing we completely forgot we were listening to the same song played over and over in different languages, the weather was great which made it even better, the only downside is that shops and drinks are really expensive but then its Disney...its once in a blue moon (unless you go every year!)...treat the kids!!",Disneyland_Paris
173926346,2,2013-8,Canada,"I was in all Disneyland parks: Orlando, California, Hong Kong, Paris. We returned this year to the one near Paris with our children. The park is completely different from the attitude that we receive in the other ones. The employees don't smile, don't great you with polite salutations like everywhere else. There is a lot of stands of food and toys but no information anywhere and indications are not as clear to find your way around. The waiting time to get a meal was inappropriate: 45 minutes standing in a line for a meal of hamburgers with children waiting next to you doesn't make any sense. This was on a week day! Can't they find enough employees to work or are they just all disorganized? Anyway, nobody cared! and then the quality of the food is awful. I ordered later on a turkey leg which is one of the thing that my kids always like in the parks, and it was so spicy even though I asked to not put any sauce and it was so dry it was ugly to look at, not at all that plump and juicy turkey leg you find everywhere else, and so expensive! You expect fast food in a Disney Park but I always found my way around to get decent food for the different taste of the family, even at the park in Hong Kong, but for sure not in the France one! Also, the bathrooms looked so old and dirty that my kid didn't want to go. It was not a happy day like it normally is in a Disney park. I don't think I would go back to that one, it was just too disapointing.",Disneyland_Paris
173871156,1,2013-8,Australia,"Don't bother!It's a cheap, over priced imitation of the real thing and you'll spend most of the day queuing up.Quite frankly e79 for a few rides is about as overpriced as you're likely to get.If its rides you're after then you'll get far better at any county show. Maybe worth considering on a fine Autumn or Spring day when there aren't so many crowds.The Disney characters are few and far between. It's located a few miles outside of Paris so it does mean that it is a whole day off your itinerary especially as you have to add queuing time to anything you actually do. The restaurants were equally bad in terms of queues.",Disneyland_Paris

Not a lot has changed since our first visit but it still holds that magic that makes everyone revert to a child and have fun.Everything is expensive at Disneyland Paris, from the park tickets to a bottle of water but it is worth every penny (or cent) that you shell out to see the look on your child's face.",Disneyland_Paris
173797931,5,2013-7,Ireland,"I went here when I was a little younger and it was amazing! It can be a bit pricey, but well worth it. Sometimes the queues can be a bit long also but they usually move quick enough. I will definetly go back when I have kids of my own.",Disneyland_Paris
173777229,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"we visited disneyland the back end of august 2013, we booked for 2 days to ensure we had enough time to get around both parks. we stayed at a hotel not far from the park, but a bus ride, after sandwiching us onto a bus like sardines and having to fight to squeeze onto the bus, we eventually arrived at the park. we went through bag checks, got our tickets and entered the park... the amount of visitors is overwhelming and the park is not big enough to deal with them all. grown adults pushing their way around the park, knocking over your children, the queuing is terrible, the shortest ride we queued for was 30 minutes, there were 5 of us (me, my wife and our 3 boys of 4,9 and 10yrs) this particular ride was the cars with 4 to a ride. we had 3 sat in one car with the eldest of our boys in another. after queuing, our boys were told to get out the cars and go sit with total strangers as they could not sit two to a car, despite 4 other cars with 2 persons of which 1 was an adult... when challenged, the attendant got very mouthy with me, had the park not been full of children that would have ended differently for him, luckily other visitors spoke out to him too. the rides we did get on without TOO much hassle we waited around 90 minutes on average for   others longer. the shows they put on have a queuing system, but then they lead you into a large hall before seating you, at which point it becomes a stampeed of adults all forcing their way forward as though their lives depend on it. we were in the mickey mouse clubhouse show, we were sitting at the very back (there are no seats just the floor, you are told taking pictures is ok but the couple sitting next to us were told off like school children because they used a flash! they promptly left, as we were at the back my children couldnt see so stood up   nobody behind and we were TOLD to sit down   we left that day before lunch, we had had enough. never will we visit again. my kids hated it",Disneyland_Paris
173765588,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,hi just come back from the davy crockett ranch had a good time weather hot stayed in a premiun cabin it was nice apart it was very dark not much cups and plates for six people had to ask for towels and toilet rolls this our 16 time at disney and i can see a lot of diffrence it as got a bit run down some of the rides keeped breaking down and things need replaceing went to the wild west show it was 110 pounds to get in but food and drink was in with it that was for 2 people wil go back again,Disneyland_Paris
173760726,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I really enjoyed the park, the rides were amazing. The restaurants were very good but only eat at the restaurants in the Disney village because they are the cheapest and the best. Make sure you watch the Disney dreams show at 11pm.",Disneyland_Paris
173711884,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Our  experience  at Disneyland Paris.First of all I would like to point out that I normally enjoy Disneyland Paris and Walt Disney World in Florida. The park theming, atmosphere and stage presence are brilliant. It was a good few years since me and the family went to Disneyland Paris, so we were looking forward to the extended 20th year anniversary experience.Facts:1. It is expensive. Don't fool yourself.2. Food   drink in the park and in Disney Village is expensive. You   re in a captive market.3. Merchandise is expensive and in some cases more so than a UK based Disney Store.4. Most staff natively speaks French. Don't expect them to speak English just because you do.5. Extra Magic hours allow guests staying at Disney hotels to enter the Disneyland Park 2 hours before official opening.6. It was unbelievably busy. By mid afternoon the turnstiles showed 67,000 visitors.7. If you enjoy smoking   great it   s just for you. If not YOU WILL GET ANNOYED!This holiday was booked direct via the Disneyland Paris website in January this year (2 adults and 2 children   girls 5 and 9 years old).We took the 2 days extra free offer so opted for the 7 days   6 nights stay on site at the Sequoia Lodge. Park tickets would be provided for the entire stay. Breakfast in the hotel was also included. Flights were booked direct with Flybe from Manchester airport. Shuttle transfer from CDG Paris airport to Disneyland Paris was booked with VEA. We have used private hire buses in the past but wanted the children to enjoy a Disney themed coach amongst other holiday goers.We fully understood that going in the middle of August would mean getting there during the peak season. Having been a few years back around the same time we didn't think anything of it. We booked a really early flight outbound and a late flight return in order to spend as much time as possible in the Parks.The flight with Flybe was excellent. Customer service was brilliant. On landing at Paris CDG we had to be ushered onto a bus which took us on a back stage tour of CDG before stopping at the security check in. This is the norm and didn't cause any delays.On finally exiting the airport the rush was on to find the terminus for the VEA coaches. This is where the first stench of smoke kicks in. Cigs light up all around like Christmas fairy lights. From experience every VEA driver encountered seems to have very little English vocabulary and is never polite. So once we found the bus stop and the coach turned up it became a free for all. Not a nice site for young children. The driver literally gets out, opens up the baggage doors and gets back in his seat. You then fight to stick your cases in the hold area before anyone else. There is no organisation just pure push and shove. You need to tell the driver the name of the hotel you are going toTip:If you get the coach tickets online to print out, take a few copies in case the driver   s scanner can't read the barcode off your tickets.Journey time to Disneyland Paris from CDG with VEA was about 40 minutes. As you approach the hotels the driver will  shout  the name of the hotel as he stops outside the reception area. You need to jump off at your hotel and grab your bags.Sequoia Lodge:Every time we come to Disneyland Paris we have always stayed at Sequoia Lodge. The hotel sits at the side of the lake near Disney Village and is a short 10   15 minute walk to the Parks.We have always found the checking in process easy and the staff really friendly. You are asked to pick your breakfast time slots for your duration of stay. Rooms only become available at 3pm but you can leave your luggage in a special hold area so you can go straight to the parks.Tip:I would advise getting 7 am or 7:30 am time slots as any time after becomes really busy. Also if you want to get the most out of the extra magic hours you need to get to the park early.We went to the parks as it was 10:30am when we arrived at the hotel. More about the parks later.When we came back to the hotel we had to go to reception to retrieve the key cards for our room. You retrieve your luggage and take it back to your room. Rooms are pretty decent. You don   t get a kettle so take a travel one if you need it or hire one from reception.Breakfast at Sequoia can be a bit busy if you go too late. There   s lots of meat, pastries, juices and cereal to choose from. There are two breakfast areas (normally the restaurants in the evening). I would recommend stocking up on the bread rolls, yoghurts and anything else you can stick in a rucksack. Very handy for snacking on round the parks and saves you money. Take a few small bottles so you can top up with juice.Tip:There are lots of free water fountains just outside Disneyland Park and inside. Top up your bottles for free instead of paying extortionate prices for bottled water.After breakfast you have the option of walking to the parks, catching the small car train outside the back of the hotel or catching a regular free Disney bus to the train station outside of the Disney Village. The small train is a rip off at 2 euros a person (return) as it only takes you from the back doors of Sequoia to the security entrance of Disney Village.If you   re not tired then walk to the parks via the village. The Disney buses run every 15 minutes outside the front entrance to the hotel and they are free. The only problem is they drop you off at the bus   train station which means you have to pass through the security checks with all non hotel guests coming off the train   buses from elsewhere.If you walk, you will come to the Disney Village entrance which is blocked by security checks. You just put any rucksacks on the conveyer belt through the x ray. Hardly any delay. But if you go via the train   bus station there is a larger security check area which every day had masses of queues. We made the mistake the first day of going through the hotel   Disney village check then exiting the other side of the village through to the train   bus area instead of going round to the left of the village and straight to the parks.So go left as you exit the village via the World of Disney store to avoid going through another security check.If you decide to venture into the train station for the cheaper shops then be aware that you will have to go through another security check to get back in.Extra Magic Hours. This basically allows hotel guests to get in the park 2 hours early. 8   10am. Note that only Disneyland Park does this not the studios. Only certain rides are open early (small world, carousel, teacups, Dumbo, buzz lightyear and space mountain).We tried getting to some of these rides early and found the queues to be just as bad as they were during the day. If you want to get on Dumbo quick then be there for 8am!If you do take advantage of the extra magic hours you will need to bear right as you approach the Disney hotel   park entrance. Staff will check your hotel pass and park tickets before allowing you in.The parks opened at 10am and closed 11pm for Disneyland and 7pm for studios. I would advise you get there as early as possible to run to your favourite ride!Meals:Well burgers, pizzas and other fast(ish) food are the order of the day. Some places have extra bowls of salad. The Earl of Sandwich (Disney Village) is probably the most reasonable food place (it   s a sort of cross between Subway   Starbucks   Mc Donalds).We and many others got the feeling that Disneyland Paris were on a tight budget this year. There seemed to be many things cut back (inc parades, maintenance, character roaming). Characters:Cut backs? There were less around saying it was peak season. People were queuing near the princess pavilion to meet a princess (1 hour wait). You got the occasional character appear and get mobbed by pushy parents.We took a character breakfast at Cafe Mickey and at first I was a bit skeptical due to the cost. But the self service hot food was excellent and the character one on one interaction was brilliant for the children.Tip:Studios have characters appear 1pm   3pm for 10   15 minutes a time right outside the areas near Cinemagique   Stitch Live. If you sit on the studio stage area you can see the characters come down the side of Cinemagique area and try and get to them before the mob sees them.Pram Strollers:Take a cheap buggy (even if your child   s 4 or 5   there   s a lot of walking).Attractions:Queues, queues, queues. I couldn't believe how busy the parks were every day. Even the fast loading rides had queue lengths of 40 minutes minimum. Oh and if a cast member suddenly says the ride is broken down or temporary closed, hang around. On many occasions, Big Thunder Mountain, Studio Tram Ride, Disney railroad (frontierland station) we were told its temporary shut. Only to find once the crowd had dispersed they opened it again.Oh and Crush's Coaster in the studios frequently had the worse queue management ever. Waiting times of nearly 2 hours. Get there for 9am (even though the studio only officially opens at 10am). People queue at the ride ready for 10am open.Fastpass:Fastpass is supposed to get you a time slot on the popular rides. You put your park ticket in a fastpass machine next to the ride and above you the clock will show a particular time slot when the ticket will be allowed. So you might get 10:30am   11:00am. You get a printed ticket with the time on and the idea is you return back within that time slot and get to enter the fastpass queue bypassing the long wait for the ride. Only so many tickets are allocated per time slot so the clock increments by 5 minutes when enough have been printed for a time slot. The biggest problem encountered here is that as soon as the park opens a huge throng of people hog the fastpass machines, thus creating a queue as long as the ride itself! And then what you find is people will start queuing in the fastpass ride entrance hours before their ticket is due. On many occasions we found that we had to queue behind time wasters only to eventually see the cast member start to look at everyone   s tickets (after about 10 minutes). Those not yet due their slot would just stand to the side but still hog the entrance. Annoying. Why CM's couldn't actually manage this better escapes me.Parades:To us it seemed that the studios parade was a cut down version of one a few years back. The difference is that this parade lasted about 10 minutes with about 5 cars of  stars . No dancing, stopping or interaction required!The Disneyland Park parade was better but still not as good as a few years back. Lasted about 20 minutes.Fireworks:We made the mistake of getting to the end of Main Street USA ready to grab a spot around an hour before the show. Not a chance. Even if you get a reasonable view of the castle you immediately get blocked by a swarm of iPads, mobiles and cameras lifted into the air whilst folks try and record the whole show.The next day we grabbed a spot right in front of the castle (to the left near the iron fencing). We got there 2 1 2 hours early for the 11pm show! Not the best for small children to hang around for so long but if you keep them entertained they will be fine. The Disney Dreams show is really worth watching. You need to get a good spot to see the cartoon images projected onto the water sprays as some of them are quiet low on the castle.Tip: Many people were sat with iPads, consoles and books whilst they waited to pass the time. Go to the toilet before you get your spot, stock up on food and DON'T move!You will find a lot of ignorant people will slowly try and push their way into the smallest places if you leave any gap. Sounds ruthless but if you have been waiting for 2 hours only to find someone trying to shove in the last minute it will wind you up.One thing I learned on this particular trip is to leave your manners at home, as most of the crowd we encountered couldn't care less.Smoking:Each to their own but when as a family we enter a park which is supposed to be a no smoking (except in designated areas) we don't expect cigs lighting up outside the shops, sat waiting for parades, waiting for the fireworks and worse of all waiting in the queues.To see adults lighting up in front of small children stuck in ride queues is disgusting. I lost count of the amount of times our children nearly turned round into someone   s cig ends. There are areas in the park for smokers. Children   s ride queues are certainly not one of them. The whole park was littered with cig ends. Not one cast member asked anyone to put out their cig. If you have children who have chest problems then seriously think twice about losing your temper with the free for all smoking attitude. I don't recall this ever being so bad in the past nor do I remember anyone allowed to smoke in Walt Disney World in Florida.Staff (Cast Members):To be honest we didn't have many issues with cast members. Most were pleasant and as long as you give a little courtesy and try and speak a little French you should be OK. Just a  bonjour  and  merci  at a minimum. Most staff will recognise you as being English and speak in English. Ordering set meals from menus has been made easy with a simple  menu 1  or  menu 2  choice. The fun is when you try and customise them.You will encounter the occasional grumpy one though so be prepared to just point at things.Summary:In summary the park was over crowded every day, fastpasses had run out by 12pm, Disneyland Paris seemed to be recreating scenes from Mary Poppins London smog filled streets with the amount of smokers puffing away, queues were horrendous and rides constantly broke down. The weather was brilliant though :)Disneyland Paris used to appeal to all ages but now seems to have lost its appeal to families with children.I would seriously consider saving the extra cash for next time and doing the Florida version.",Disneyland_Paris
173709431,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from an amazing three days at Disneyland, Paris. It is the most amazing place, thousands and thousands of people which makes the place even more incredible because they handle the masses remarkably well. Do not go if you can't be doing with standing in a queue, as you will queue for everything, from checking in at your hotel to meeting a character to getting a coffee in the park, but it sort of doesn't matter cos everyone is doing it!We stayed in the Hotel Cheyenne which is walking distance from the Park along the canal and lake. If you walk to and from the park you will miss out the first big queue of the day which is the bag check before you even enter either of the parks. We had fantastic weather which really helped, but my husband and I felt that two days was plenty for us, but the kids would have stayed for ever I think. It is expensive, but we took our own lunch and masses of snacks and drinks in our rucksacks to keep the kids going all day. Take plasters for blisters, you will walk miles and miles but for all the aches and pains it is worth all of it!!",Disneyland_Paris
173679936,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I have never written a review before so I don't really know where to start......... This was our annual holiday this year. We did come over three years ago in February and we had a nice time this week was a completely different story...We stayed at the Davy Crockett Ranch which was actually nice, very dark but clean and local to the park. I guess it went downhill from there.We have a disabled son so knew that we could get a pass in 'City Hall' which would enable us to access the rides easier. After a 35 minute queue a lady took our details and before handing over the pass decided to ask and tick off a range of boxes that applied to our sons needs; 'is he mentally deficient?' She asked. I'm sure there are more sensitive and more appropriate ways to address this. You would think the pass would make our life easier... We were wrong. After fighting the crowds to get to The pirate ride we were told that we needed to book a time slot   we did this for four hours later (the earliest slot they had) and fought our way back through the crowds to Thunder mountain for my eldest daughter   that wasn't working so then to Space Mountain   we collected the fast pass and went to the buzz lightyear ride   we waited 40 minutes at the disabled gate, a Disney Customer Service Rep walked by and asked us if she could help   I explained what we were waiting for and she replied with ' I'm not on this section so I can't help you!' I could go on about the fact that Space Mountain then broke down, the fact that a Disney Rep pushed our wheelchair out the way to make space for another family so we couldn't see the parade, the disgusting toilets, the rude staff and the fact that even when you ask people not to blow spoke in your sons face they then do it again on purpose, the way we were told to make our way to the disabled seats through a crowd of people sitting on the floor in Playhouse Disney without any help, the way we were told to hurry up off the slinky dog ride as we were holding up the queue (not easy with a 7 years old who can't walk), I could go on, but you get the picture.Having been to both Florida and California I find it hard to believe that they are in the same company as euro disney   it needs a whole new fresh management system and someone who is customer service orientated driving it forward.We won't be going back ever again.",Disneyland_Paris

173592490,4,2013-4,Germany,My son is 4 and yes there is a lot for him to do. The Disney show is worth to wait when the park is close.

173578090,1,2013-8,Australia,This is my kids (2 & 4) first time to Disneyland   I can remember visiting both parks in the States. My first impressions were it's quite small .. but not small enough to jam pack it full of $75 pp people !! Once you understand what is overwhelming about the park   5:1 ratio of Disney Shops to buy your memorabilia because you got cheesed off waiting in 45 60 minute queues for just a 1 minute ride.Obviously the people who run the park don't hire parents   as nobody was accommodating. Why do people work in Tourism if they hate Tourists. Now   the ultimate Plus .. Being Pregnant means you get to go to the front of the lines ... nobody told us this before hand .. We found out on the last day !Queuing for unclean toilets is a joke.,Disneyland_Paris
173549455,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"It is August holidays after all, so we were expecting the worst, but were still surprised at how poor the whole experience was.    200 for 2 adults and 1 child for 1 day pass to 1 park.    50 for the return journey by train. We managed 8 rides in 12 hours. A total of approx 25? mins actually on rides. Should we have to pay more for fast passes who also had to queue? This wasn't on the adverts.. Ok, a couple of rides were good, but so short. Food, drink, treats   everything very overpriced for a captive audience. If you have young children of a certain age, they will like the scenery, but how can queuing for hours on every ride be enjoyable? Some restaurants closed at 6... Er, tea time? Fireworks at 11pm? Judging by how packed the train was with glum and tired faces, they couldn't wait that long either. We remarked that we saw many more tired and bored or frustrated looking faces than happy ones. Clearly all about the money, to the point that we felt mocked and rather stupid for going. Luckily several fantastic days in Paris meant this was the only bad day of our holiday. Take my advice and think of all the other wonderful things to do before you go and don't learn the hard way like we did.",Disneyland_Paris

The Disney Dreams show was amazing (although was very late at night our 2 youngest were asleep and needed waking up). Down side lots of queuing(was expected as went in August), lots of walking, and No Merrida! My daughter's love this fisty princess and after queuing to meet the princesses for an awful long time we found out there is no Merrida only the usual princesses, very sad.I asked at the town hall if Merrida was here but unfortunately didn't get the answer I wanted, I had very unhappy little girls not been Mickey could Christensen up :( other than that Disney was wonderful :)",Disneyland_Paris

173461279,1,2013-8,Germany,"We visited DLP four years ago and it was a wonderful experience for us and our 2 sons. We decided to return as our smallest son is now 8 years old and he can finaly enjoy the  big atractions . But you should not repeat the nice experiences as you can experience big dispointements. What was wrong on 14 and 15th August in DLP? Everything...Practically all the important atractions were not functioning at some time. Some of them, like Thunder Mountain or Space Mission were functioning maximum 2 3 hours in total in the two days. We were also blocked inside in Buzz Lightyear for approx 20 30 minutes, all scores erased etc and also blocked in the Hounted House for 20 minutes. All the fun was gone. We waited in the studios for 90 minutes for the Sammy atraction and when we were ready to ride it was broken...for almost 40 minutes...You can imagine that people not being able to use one atraction were moving to others and the ques were growing and growing (practically it was impossible to ride anything, even minor atractions without waiting at least 60 minutes even at 10 pm! Aerosmith was broken in the morning at first hour on 16.08 and Indiana Jones roller coaster was also not functioning for some hours. We paid almost 550 Euro for 4 persons and we got only broken atractions and huge ques...Even if you get a fast passs (and you wait also for this....) in the end we were just throwing them away as the atraction was not functioning anymore when we returned to use our fast pass...So sad that DLP became a ruin...",Disneyland_Paris

We had five rides close while we were in the queue and with too excited young children it was very upsetting. Two of them (pirates of the caribbean and thunder mountain) we had already waited for over an hour. We were at the park for over 12 hours and went on a total of 5 rides having spent the whole day in lines.

173435490,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We   ve just stepped off the Eurostar after four fantastic days at Disneyland Paris. Reading some of the negative reviews I can hardly believe they   re describing the same place     I can only assume they   re all Daily Mail readers. We bought a package that included train, hotel and entry to both parks and everything ran smoothly from start to finish     tiring but thoroughly enjoyable. Here are some top tips:1. Planning: yes of course it   s crowded, but so was Glastonbury, the Olympics and Le Mans and yet these were some of my best holidays of recent years     crowds create the atmosphere. Can you imagine the opposite? Plan your day and it   s easy: get up early and do a couple of the popular rides; book some Fastpass tickets; pop back to the excellent Sequoia Lodge for breakfast and then return. Book some more Fastpasses; have lunch at Videopolis so you   re entertained while you eat; have a swim at the hotel or take in one of the easy access shows (Animagic, Cinemagic, Moteurs Action or Playhouse); have an early dinner at Caf   Mickey so you are guaranteed to meet the stars then return to the park for the parades and if you can for the evening show, truly amazing light show.2. Buggies: we went with our four and six year old boys who have long outgrown their buggies but we wish we   d taken them: it   s exhausting. Hire a buggy: 15 Euros well spent.3. Smoking: the French (and Spanish and Italians) like a smoke and it was pretty annoying after a while. They smoke everywhere and if you   re sensitive, be prepared but don   t let this spoil your fun.4. Breakdowns: sure, rides break down but what do you expect from a resort that never closes? Be patient: the staff respond quickly and get things going again with remarkable efficiency.5. Queuing: I hate queuing but you   re forewarned as to queue lengths and if you mix it up with Fastpass you can easily do six to eight rides a day. We were there for four days and did every single ride at least once. There wasn   t much pushing in. A lot of rides did seem to leave part filled which was frustrating and it was easy to stay on for a second go (staff seemed to ignore this) but everyone got a turn.6. Staff: the staff were lovely: helpful, knowledgeable, multilingual and very patient: what more could you expect for minimum wage?7. Litter: the place was immaculate     I have never seen so many litter collectors in one place! I can   t believe people have complained about this. If I see litter anywhere, I pick it up and bin it. It   s really not that difficult.8. Meet the stars: we had no trouble meeting everyone. The Mickey Caf   was the best place but they also made regular appearances at our hotel and around the resort. The staff always knew where to go so simply ask them if your little one is dying to meet Donald (like ours) or any of his friends.9. And finally: if you don   t like queues, take the paddle steamer round the lake; climb up to the tree house; play in the Indian Village playground; stroll up and down Main Street; explore Alice   s labyrinth; or do a couple of circuits on the Disneyland railroad.I like to think of myself as a cultured Guardian reader who would never stoop so low as a theme park but we had a great time and I can   t wait to go back next year (and so do our children of course!).",Disneyland_Paris

This is all about the money   don't buy into all the fancy commercials, it's a lie.

173375197,1,2013-8,United States,"My family visited Disneyland Paris last week. Because we are all Disney fans, I am trying to find something good to say about it. Ummm...Tower of Terror is great!That's about it!First the service. One member of our party is over 60, after we paid admission we found out that he was entitled to a 35% senior discount. We tried to get our refund no joy. They told us we should have told them his age when we bought the ticket, but there is NO WHERE around the ticket area that announces the discount.Second the prices. A 2 park one day pass is 79 euros (about 90 U.S) which is more than a park hopper at WDW with 4 parks included and a lot more attractions in the U.S., Paris is missing some of the best rides. We knew that going in and decided to go anyway. We made the mistake of not bringing water an lunch to the park. The prices at any theme park are outrageous, but Disney Paris is looking to break records! A 2 ounce bag of chips was 4 euros! A bottle of water was 8. Absolutely horrible. We cancelled our dinner reservations in the park because of the prices and went back to Paris to eat, missing the nighttime show simply because inner was more ridiculously price than any 5 star restaurant in Paris!The crowds were awful. Disney in the states will shut the gates if it gets that full. No less than a 90 minute line anywhere. No crowd control at all! Pickpockets were in force as well, there is no security and we saw several people upset because they had been victimized.Anyone who is used to Disney in the U.S., needs to eware rides are NOT the same! Indiana Jones and Space Mountain have loops that go upside down. I am not a person who can handle upside down, and I expected the same rides. I was not prepared for the loops and became ill on IndianaJones. I asked first before Space Mountain and abstained. What a disappointment! There should be enough information in the guide to forewarn guests. I would never go back to Disney Paris!!",Disneyland_Paris
173374304,4,2013-7,South Africa,"Our kids loved every second of it. The attractions and decor are truly spectacular.

173369422,4,2013-7,Qatar,"It was a nice tour not only for children but I think it's a good fun for adults as well. I always had fear for most of the rides but this place is different. First many rides are neither very long (with respect to time) nor small. They finishes exactly at the time when you reach to the extreme of excitement. The only issue is waiting time. The better thing compare to studio is that there are few rides which are open early for Disney hotel guests. On the other hand one should do homework for the rides availability (should not be under maintenance). We stood in front of one Gate to catch the ride early and after waiting for around 20 minutes they announced rides are not working and some where under maintenance. The fire show at night is very nice but a tip to photographers, go with wide angle lens and stand in front as near as possible to the castle. The Fire works doesn't go very high but is just few feets above the Castle. If you are far away, you will find many people standing in front of you and they don't listen.",Disneyland_Paris

Lines are long for not so great attractions or worse versions of the attractions in other parks. Too many shops. Restaurant staff was not that friendly.For me part of the magic of Disney are the staff that is always super nice, calm, always smiling, etc. This was not the case in this park.But again, if you have never been to the others I feel like it will be a good experience.",Disneyland_Paris
173313780,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Have just got back from a couple of days in Disneyland Paris, staying at Ranch Davy Crockett. The trip was for our 4 year old grand daughter and although she enjoyed herself we didn't really find anything had changed from when we took our own kids soon after the Parc opened. Discoveryland was pretty much as it had been but 20 years older and looking it!Very few of the Parc staff are customer focused, in fact I told one to smile while serving us as she looked as miserable as sin, definitely a case for 'Undercover Boss'   I don't think Disney Execs would be very impressed!A warning   beware the buggy stroller 'thieves'! Buggies can be hired for 15 euros a day and very useful they are too but the only way to identify them is a name card placed in a see through holder on the handle. When leaving them outside rides there is no way of securing them and they have a habit of not being there when you come out! We had ours 'stolen' twice which meant a trip back almost to the entrance to pick up another one   no charge but still very annoying, meanwhile somebody is swanning around the Parc in a buggy they haven't paid for.Ranch Davy Crockett came in for some criticism and I must admit I was a bit worried but apart from the 'cabin' being very dark (and looking it's 20 years) accommodation was OK. You must try and get a package deal though and would certainly recommend half board as the fairly mediocre food throughout the Parc is very expensive. Best couple of meals we had were in the Disney Village   how anyone finishes the portions in Annette's Diner is beyond me!Can't say I wouldn't recommend Disneyland Paris but they do need to remind the staff that they are only there because of the paying guests and a refurbishment programme and some updated rides etc wouldn't go amiss.Would I go again   probably not.",Disneyland_Paris

173244547,1,2013-8,France,"Do not go to Disneyland Paris. We (a family of 8) had the misfortune to go on 20th August 2013. The place was packed with visitors and starved of staff. The queues were typically well over one hour for (mainly mediocre) rides lasting little more than a minute. The staff who were in evidence were often incompetent, meaning that changeovers for rides were far longer than they would have been in a competently run bank holiday funfair in England. There were so few Disney characters that the few who did appear were mobbed, prompting their minders to threaten to 'take them away'. It seems to be part of the business plan that with so little to do other than queue, visitors are forced to enter one of the shops which dominate the entire park. If you or your family love theme parks, there are many which are vastly better and cheaper in the UK. if you or your family love Disney characters, they will experience disappointingly few of them here: there were barely any walking around in the long hours that we were there. If you want to buy Disney products, do it somewhere where they are less ludicrously priced.Overall, this felt like a thoroughly cynical operation.

Also a long wait at the entry for bag searches, looking for? as we pointed out to an attendant that a 6 inch knife had been dropped behind a bench in the main street.

But then it gets too busy, there are queues for everything and no one seens to know how to queue. The adults are the worst. Maybe they should control the amount of people going in. There are other negative s I queued for an hour just to get a ticket to see a princess but had to return three hours later fir the privilege. My daughter s saw snow white though and she was wonderful so all worth it. The food is extortionate and not much choice. We ended up driving to the nearby shopping centre and getting a good value meal. But that besides if you are prepared for that just go with the queues and expense and enjoy the magic. The lights and sights are great. A few more rides wouldn't go amiss but there is something for everyone. Also more character s walking around would be great. My biggest bit of advice is do not book a package.

Cheap and nasty decor, nothing magical anywhere. Even the staff  character  uniforms are badly made. What a waste of time and money.

Gorgeous weather, no crowds and a great experience had by all. The longest that we waited was 20 minutes and that was for the stunt car and motorcycle show. The usual wait was 10 15 minutes with several rides no wait at all. The staff was all friendly and they were able to accomodate our last minute requests for photos at one of the studios. We spent two full days and could of spent a 3rd but didn't feel we missed anything by not spending another day there.

173051553,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Enjoy rides breaking down, under staffing, rude guests, litter, being herded like cattle and a good lungful of second hand smoke? Well you've come to the right place!First of all, I am not going to make comparisons with the excellent Disneyland in California or Disneyworld resort in Florida   but it is clear that DLP would benefit from some Disney Corporation intervention.1. The main entrance. Accepting that August is the busiest time to go, there can be no excuse for the lack of control in place at the entry point where bags are checked. Even with the presence of horseback police, this was chaotic and highly dangerous   even at 11am on a weekday. We were nearly crushed and suffocated for over 30 minutes as people pushed from all sides, as staff screamed loudly in an effort to gain some control. Truly appalling to be herded in this way and an area for immediate attention before someone is seriously injured.2. The attractions. Where is the investment? Nothing has changed here in years. The park is screaming out for a new attraction or 3, and is yet to receive updates to existing attractions which have been applied at all other parks globally, e.g. Star Tours.3. The queues. Again accepting that we chose to go at the busiest time, the manner of the queues, not just the length was hard to tolerate at times. Pushing in, jumping over barriers, pretending to know someone near the front of the line   all the tactics were deployed to great annoyance of decent and patient guests. 4. Ride reliability. On a single day we witnessed Big Thunder Mountain break down, Pinocchio (twice) and Peter Pan   all after extensive queueing. Additionally the Rock and Rollercoaster Avec Aerosmith, stopped for 5 minutes in the dark, in the final tunnel before we could get off. When you are clamped in tight, this can be quite scary when there is no explanation or reassurances offered.5. Staffing. The place seemed genuinely understaffed with many cast members looking inexperienced (especially when rides broke down). Furthermore, we did not spot a single Disney character during the 4 days in the parks, except during parade time. Was this Disneyland?6. The clientele. Whilst smoking is on the decrease in other civilised parts of the world, you cannot escape it throughout DLP. If anything it has got worse. Sure, the Fume Interdiction signs are now displayed   but what's the point when they are not enforced. There is also a noticeable change   shift in the clientele (behaviourally and visually) which could be a contributory factor to the park's decline.My advice to the park   sit up and take notice before it is too late.Would we return? Probably not for a few years and certainly not in August.",Disneyland_Paris
173046497,2,2013-8,Canada,"We are a family of Disney lovers. We have been to WDW in Orlando several times as well as Disneyland in California. When we planned our trip to Disneyland Paris we expected the high standards and quality of service and experience that we have had at the other parks. We were VERY disappointed with Disneyland Paris and it makes me very sad that for many people, especially Europeans, this is their first exposure to Disney and after it, they will likely be completely turned off all things Disney for life and unwilling to give it another chance. The park was worn down and dirty. I know it's the culture, but people were smoking and littering everywhere despite the posted signs. But the worst was the surly and unhelpful staff. Also, the process for seeing the Princesses was preposterous. You line up for a  reservation  time. You come back later and still wait almost an hour, THEN you get to visit with just one princess, and you don't even get to pick which one. What 7 year old Princess worshipper would be happy with that? The rides were fine, same as elsewhere, but the crowds were ridiculous. I think that in the US, they would have stopped admitting people before it got that crazy crowded. We paid a ridiculous amount of money to stay at the (terrible) Hotel Cheyenne and take advantage of the Extra Magic Hours, but during those hours, only a small part of the park was actually open and most of the rides we wanted to do weren't running yet. It was just a big let down and I know that has to do with expectations, but isn't that what the Disney brand is supposed to represent? I want to blast it all over the internet that people need to stop going there so they will have to make changes, because it was so packed they probably don't even care how terrible it is and they won't as long as they are still making money. It will turn a lot of people off repeat visits though, that is for sure.",Disneyland_Paris

The staff really do have to be commended for their genuine care for the the park visitors.Sadly, two rides were closed for repairs during my visit earlier in the year (but it was out of season). 'Its a Small World' is one of my favourites. However, to compensate for this there were a huge number of photo opportunities and alternative attractions in extension to the normal rides and displays.As my son has a disability we were able to arrange for a 'fastpass'. It was clear how each fastpass should be used with each ride. Signage was good and the staff were extremely helpful towards 'fastpass' visitors. There was no stigma about using this service (whereas at other parks I have not encountered this and have felt quite isolated by diverting the queues.)Overall, a magical experience and one that is worth every penny.",Disneyland_Paris
173017597,4,2013-6,United States,"I know I really shouldn't compare DLP to WDW Orlando, but I did find myself struggling to feel the Disney magic. Customer service was not what I am used to from Disney, the park was a bit dirtier and run down, with several attractions down for repair as well as eateries closed down. Bathrooms were very dirty and cigarette smoke was EVERYWHERE despite the  No Smoking  signs. On a positive note, the entrance to Disneyland Park was gorgeous. We prefer the Paris castle as it had more of a fairy tale look to it. Pirates of the Caribbean was better in Paris. Disney Village was just OK. Merchandise choices in DLP is very limited compared to the states.I enjoyed Cinemagique at the Studios, but, as a person who doesn't enjoy thrill rides, I don't see much reason to return to this park.If I were in the Paris area in the future, I do think I would return for another visit, but I would lower my expectations and accept DLP for what it is and not compare it to Florida.",Disneyland_Paris
172937432,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,Wow .. I have been to all the Disney parked around the world & have to say I love Paris the most .. It's the cleanest as its the best .. When we were there space mountian & big thunder mountain had broken down which was disappointing but we still had great fun !!,Disneyland_Paris
172910337,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"This was our forth visit to DLP and we loved it as much if not more than before. As ever the place is just beautiful and full of magic. Loved the new Princess Pavillion, Magic On Parade and well what can I say about Dreams, its just Fantastic, like nothing ive seen before. My 2 girls are 4 and 13 and there is so much for each of their ages and as a family.Cant wait to return.",Disneyland_Paris
172873070,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,This part of the park is better for little ones as not many thrill seekers rides. The show at 11pm Disney Dreams is a must,Disneyland_Paris
172867928,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Lots to do,my daughter loved invitation to the princesses   make sure you get an invitation earlier in the day with a time slot.",Disneyland_Paris
172857403,2,2013-8,Italy,This place is beautiful. Everybody knows. Kids love it. We love it. All the attractions are engeniered up to the smallest detail. But what if than you are swept away by a crazy crowd that throws garbage eveywhere and screems and push an you have to line up for ages before you can access to anything? Where is the magic going than???,Disneyland_Paris
172841660,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,I visited Disneyland Paris with my school year and it was the best experience of my life. We had a two day pass to both parks. There was never a moment where you had nothing to do. The best thing was that you could go on the same ride 3 or 4 times one after the other. The que wasn't that bad to get on a ride. Even though there were loads of people it was still the best trip i have been on. I liked that there were restaurants as well so you could have fun and also go for something to eat. My favourite ride was thunder mountain. I would definitely go back again and you can go with anyone because it suits all the family and when your with friends its great as well because you all go on the same rides. This is the best attraction i have been too!!  3,Disneyland_Paris
172840416,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We had a good day at Disney. The rides were varied and fun, the queues were ok I suppose for August (max 1 hour though!) and the whole atmosphere was good. We didn't see a single Disney character wandering around though and had to leave before the fireworks as they were due for 11pm, too late for us as we were based in the centre of Paris, hence my rating of  average , though the rides were either very good or brilliant!",Disneyland_Paris
172831853,4,2013-8,Norway,"Yes, of course it is busy on school holidays. Everyone else is having their vocation in July August as well! Anyway the key words to a trip to Disneyland is  be prepared ! Do your homework before you go and you'll enjoy it so much! At least I did and so did my almost 6 year old who had his birthday while in Disneyland Paris. Even though I haven't been to American Disney parks I am pretty sure and have heard the crowds are huge and the queues even longer there. Anyway   we had a magical brilliant four days in DLP this week. The cons to the Disneyland really are some guests who don't seem to have manners whatsoever but this isn't something you could accuse the parks for! The staff we encountered during our visit were polite and friendly. You just have to approach with a smile and bonjour and you get what you want! :) Some shop or cafe assistants looked a little tired and ignorant though. Anyway I always wished them  have a nice day  and they then replied with the same and even with a smile.The toilets do get quite dirty in some more crowded areas but I never went to those I saw many people at (queuing). Just look around and you see toilet signs in many locations around the parks. Remember the more quiet locations and it never was too much trouble to walk to those (one for example in the Discovery Arcade (not the one next to First Aid but inside the Arcade), the ones between Frontierland and Adventure Land, close Tower of Terror etc never got busy and was no queue. I saw staff cleaning the restrooms all the time. And use the paper toilet seat covers people! Don't draw them out but use the button on the  machine  to get a seat cover! I think it was hygienic with no touch flush and the seat cover papers! The water from the fountains does not taste specially good, but of course because I am spoiled with excellent tap water in homeland. But I drank it a little and never got sick. The prices are high but when you look at where I live then I again are used to these kind of or even higher prices. Anyway it probably ends up as an expensive holiday for everyone having kids. It is very difficult to have the fights with the little ones when all the merchandise and sweets are in their face all the time :DIt was my second time to DLP and after my first trip last year I also thought there's only bad fast food available. Wrong! Thanks to Trip Advisor Disneyland Paris forum I found out there's a lot of nice cafes and restaurants in the parks and village at the hotels. I had no time to test them all out unfortunately but the ones we did had good quality or normal buffet food available. Meaning you don't have to eat burgers and chips every day! In the busy times using Fast pass is a must. It saved us from hours of queuing. You still queue but approximately 20 30 minutes and not 2 hours! The parades are cute in both parks. Kids love the characters who actually are present, just look at the programs for both parks and there's the locations and times. There should be more proper queuing for the characters meet and greets as there are for Buzz Lightyear and Mickey Minnie in Studios park and for Winnie the Pooh and friends near Casey's corner. Book dinner buffet at the Inventions restaurant to meet characters and get the autographs in more civilized way!And finally   Disney Dreams spectacular at park closing time is FANTASTIC! This alone is worth a visit and the reason I want to return soon!!!",Disneyland_Paris
172816130,5,2012-9,United Arab Emirates,"the place is so magical, its like you are in to another world. the decor is almost real, and the rides are really great! the concept of paying once only and play as much you is really good.must be visited if you plan to go to paris! perfect for adults and children.",Disneyland_Paris
172793466,5,2013-8,Finland,"Disneyland Park is a wonderful place to simply explore. Dig out your inner child and dwelve into the magic of the Park: climb to the Robinson family house, meet Captain Jack, hug Winnie the Pooh, admire the wonderful Sleeping Beauty castle and greet the ever smiling staff of the park. Few tips for the adventure:  The Walt Disney Studios Park closes earlier than Disneyland Park, so end our day in Disneyland Park  Bring your own picnic and save money  Prepare to queue almost everywhere  If you want to see the parade (which I recommend), better to pick your spot REALLY EARLY. The parade starts at 7pm, so better to be there already after 6pm, front row spots even before that. The parade travels along the main street and is really amazing.  Don't start your shopping right after the parade, 'cos most of the families leave right after that. Wait for an hour and then start spending.  The Lights Show, which starts at 11pm, is also worth seeing. You shouldn't go too far from the Sleeping Beauty castle, or you won't see enough. On the other hand, if you plan to leave by train back to Paris, you'd better choose your place closer to the exits. The last train to Paris was really crowded when we left 11.30 pm.  If you want to meet the Princesses, better book your meeting early from the Mill. The times had run out when we got there around 5 pm.  Final tip expecially fro the Finns: it's all about Mickey. Don't expect to find lots of stuff from all your favourite Disney movies, since 80% of the sold accessories have Mickey or Minney in them.",Disneyland_Paris
172762579,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We went end of July and beginning of august and loved it. Our children are 5 and 9 and they were the perfect age. Yes it is expensive so go prepared bring in your own drinks and snacks, we had a pushchair and brought in some food and stored it underneath the pushchair. The queues were fine early morning and early evening but got bad in the afternoon so use this time to go to the studios to see the shows. I wasn't sure if I was going to like it as I don't like queing but I loved it so much I am planning our next trip. Our kids loved meeting the characters we saw quite a few and the parades were stunning i was surprised how easy it was to get a good viewing spot. Shows in studios were fab. Can't wait til next time.",Disneyland_Paris
172749857,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Ours was a birthday treat, a 50th but to bring the whole family, youngest 4, and some young adults. We started as soon as we go off the train, bags sent to the hotel, we sent to the park for the first ride.It is difficult to keep a 4 year old and young adults amused at exactly the same time, but it worked well for us, splitting up and rendezvous later. The rides are good, but don't take too long, and the queue's are a nightmare. You have to be patient, not mind kids bumping into you, swinging on the bars that separate the lines etc, make sure you have some shade, food and water to keep you going... all just to get to the ride. So queue's, rides, lots and lots of people are all the kind of things you must expect coming to such an attraction, but this is clearly not for everyone. The waiting time can be a killer, the push and shove generally (just lots of people in the same space) can be daunting enough, the cultural differences of 'queue discipline' to endure etc   you really need to be in the right frame of mind to survive....but then there are the prices. : ( You can't come to Disney without some serious money in my opinion. Just as an example for some item prices, your average bottle of cold drink, cola or lemonade is just over    3   there are free water fountains around, so bring a water bottle to fill up. A meal from one of the fast food places will cost a minimum of    10  a head, and these are not huge meals. Some interesting variety but not 'fantastique'   so whatever the exchange rate you need to do the maths, but I just think in   's and compare. For me an 'average' McD's meal deal in the UK is about what you are getting at the fast food outlets, UK price would be about   3.50, Disney price is   10     15 depending on what you order. The cheapest pint (50 cl) of beer I could find was    6.59 (Krone 1664)   the cheapest bottle of wine was    19.99   so what was a 'basic (but nice) meal of good burgers in a proper restaurant (Planet H) for 7 of us was   170. Thats one meal, and we stayed for 5 days. A trick is to eat well at breakfast (stuff yourself) and slip in a extra couple of rolls or croissants in your bag to keep you topped up during the day.We were lucky with the weather, nice hot and sunny, and we had a lot of fun for sure. So prepare your minds and expectations and bring a lot of money and Mickey will take care of the rest.",Disneyland_Paris
172722946,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,We have visited Paris before and also Florida. This time we found the staff were much better friendlier and more helpful however we noticed after having accidentally asking one that it appeared the American management were there so were they making extra effort? Well let's hope it continues. It was extremely busy but the queue times were always better than shown thankfully. There was a lack of characters around the park a little disappointing but the rides were still just as good as remembered. The kids still felt it was special and were surprised that pin trading wasn't so obvious or popular in France. Most of the staff were very patient while the trade either did or didn't happen! Fast pass system worked well too! Great fun for all just expect to spend a lot on food and refreshments.,Disneyland_Paris
172710445,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Just came back from disneyland and the whole family loved it! Yes it is busy and there are queues (which some of the rude French cannot seem to grasp the concept of), but if you are aware of this before you go you are ready for it. Food not as expensive as people make out, and staff are great. Most of the rides have the fast pass facility which you don't need to pay for, however, we missed some of the rides out as they didn't have the facility and wait time was 2 hours. There are signs at entrance to rides giving approx wait times though so at least you can make a decision and maybe check back later. The Disney dreams show is one of the best shows I have ever seen. The only disappointing thing was the lack of characters walking about, and one of the rides was closed. We are currently saving our pennies for a return trip!",Disneyland_Paris
172706416,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We had such high expectations of the park and were really looking toward to our trip but were bitterly disappointed. Our boys are 4,6 and 13 and were all excited to stay for 3days. We stayed in the Davy crockett ranch which was good but that's where the magic ended. The park was way too busy and nothing like the world you imagine. Poor queuing system for rides (they need to adopt Legolands Q bot system), shocking toilets, rude people Q jumping and smoking in front of children. NO characters anywhere and overpriced junk food. Everywhere you look it's just shops, shops and more shops. We paid a lot of money for three days and I just wish I had put it towards a trip to Florida which sounds like the real deal. You really will have a better time at Lego land, chessington or drusillas. No Disney magic left here. Sorry!",Disneyland_Paris
172698725,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Overall bloody marvellous! Wife and I took 4 year old daughter for 5 days. Stayed at the sequilla lodge hotel which was very good, rooms spacious and clean, no tea and coffee as per other reviews however if this is a deal breaker you really need to get out more! Park amazing but absolutely relentless. 15 hour days all week, a relaxing holiday this is not! Swimming pool was cold though as per other reviews but once you can't feel your bits anymore not really an issue! Kids loved it as they have no thermostat at that age. For your benefit I have broken points down into the good the bad the plan!The good.....  Hotel, clean and staying in the park gives you 2 hours (8am to 10am) on some rides before the riff raff get in. Bizarre walking around one of the busiest places on earth with no one there!  The main park. Castle, rides, shops, food all good. Meeting a princess, you have to pre queue and get a voucher to queue up again to meet one, but the look on my daughters face was well worth the misses sun stroke!  Cafe Mickey   characters.   The night show, stuff projected onto the castle and amazing fireworks etc.  The parades in both parks, they know how to put on a show!  The drive from euro tunnel. Do not be afraid of saving   600 and not getting the Eurostar. Euro tunnel are on Tesco vouchers so crossing can be free and then it's 3 motorways (21 euro) toll and you're there in about 2.5 hours. It is also 120 euro to get transfer from either the train station or airport in Paris. Eurostar forget to tell you that!The bad....  Not all rides open between 8am and 10am, can get a bit boring after a couple of days  Studio park for smaller kids, mainly shows rather than rides its worth a day out of the week though.  Disney playhouse live. You all have to sit on the floor with the other 400 people on a bit of green carpet about the size of a living room rug after not being told this would be the case so you sit anywhere and then they move you into the correct area and you sit on someone's feet whilst the person in front of you gently sweats through their hair into your face! My recommendation would be to ignore the easy jet squash and stand at the back!   Lack of fast pass on the bigger rides  Parisians and some other non English speaking natives! Never ever apologise, ever, even when they bloody well know they are in the wrong and they have just squashed a 4 year old child between several adults and a big metal post whilst swinging their overfilled rucksack in her face and then looking at you as if you have just slept with their wife! Who by the way has just about enough clothes on to make it decent in a family park! (Rant over)  Toilets, after about 10.01am they have to be the most disgusting things in the world, in Disneyland defence they are probably cleaned over and over again, but you are about to mix with people who can not aim straight and that's not just the blokes! Do not wear a onesie or clothing you are unable to hold whilst hovering over the toilet.  What's that wet patch on the back of my dress.....   Mickeys dinner food! If you can call it that! You are defo paying for the characters to come in which is great but the food is terrible.The plan...  Some bigger rides don't have fast pass or are open before 10am. You need to plan which rides to go on first and when you see 100 min waiting time DO NOT think it will be better later, it won't! A friend had a colour coded map which I took the mick out of if I'm honest, however it was the best thing she could have done. You need to organised. I am selling park maps on my eBay, whilst I know they are free in the park,if I knew just how lack of planning would have ruined my really expensive holiday, I would have paid for a map!   Training, 4 cans of Stella a night in the lead up to your trip will not see you through! This is boot camp guys NOT a holiday! Walking approx 12 miles a day whilst pushing a buggy full of overpriced Disneyland tat and then carrying a 4 year old child through queues all day is hard work! Do not underestimate just how many people are there!  Food, pay for the half board, and make sandwiches from the breakfast buffet for lunch, everyone else is doing it but they are pretending to play around with the top of their rucksacks too! We got tutted at by a couple next to us, but if they want to pay   25 for 6 bags of chips and 4 cokes, crack on. An evening meal will easily be 35 euros a head, for a family that's over   100 a night. 6.99 euro for a beer! If you are driving go to Tesco and load up with crisps, cakes and beer, kids drinks etc. We paid about   250 for the half board option for 3 of us for 4 nights.Overall this was an absolutely amazing holiday, a lot of money but well worth it. I heard a lot of   if I was going to Disney then I would go to the real one  you know what, I can't afford to do that and I need to do the best for my kids. You get a princess castle and a load of rides and people dressed up as stuff. Kids do not give a monkeys where they are and to be honest you get so engrossed in it all, this is the real one............People are on this site moaning about the place, go somewhere else then, one less person in the queue!",Disneyland_Paris
172698664,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We went 12 years ago and how it has changed. It is overly expensive and and massive money making machine. Lucky to get a smile out of the staff, if you see any, apart from the performers. Not enough toilets, rides weren't working, massive queues and very few fast pass tickets available. The place was just not clean and didn't have the magic you get in the US. Restaurants cannot possibly justify the prices they charge, based on the quality and cleanliness.Top tips would be to get a good cool bag, go to the Auchan Supermarket 5 mins from Disney and get a great picnic, for 20 % of what you will pay for any of the rubbish inside.",Disneyland_Paris
172694103,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"So much to do for all ages. We loved the Peter Pan ride, It's a small world, Buzz Lightyear and the absolute highlight was Star Tours.We did not like the length of queues (what's new?) and the amount of time it took to get served at eating outlets, especially the really slow ice cream vendors.",Disneyland_Paris
172660580,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Be prepared to wait up to 60 120 min for a ride, that lasts only 60seconds. your feet will ache and your children will drive you crazy when your in the queue. I thought I was the only parent trying to keep a straight face for the kids, but when I looked at the others all of them were biting their lips or holding their heads in their hands! My children started to get sore noses and throats at the amount of smokers around them. There was a place in Disneyland where someone was puffing their toxic fumes at children. Think twice before you go, I wish I did.",Disneyland_Paris
172637726,5,2013-6,Romania,We planned our family vacation to Disneyland and other attractions in the area. Nice clean friendly place . We had a great time at this place. Disneyland is the type of theme park you need to attend as soon as the gates open.,Disneyland_Paris
172628213,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"This is truly the meaning of such an over used word   awesome. The entrance to the park and the immediate environment all add up to an awe inspiring introduction. The appeal for children is sharply focused although the absence of Disney characters was surprising and disappointing. We had 7 hours of enjoyment, even the persistent queuing didn't detract from that enjoyment too much. The positives were the truly authentic sets and some brilliant rides. The negatives   other rides were pedestrian with tired ineffective animatronics   Pirates of the Caribbean and the Haunted House in particular. The price of food and drink was ridiculously expensive, a Coke and a small bottle of water cost 7 to 8 Euros. Overall your kids will love it and with a bit of preparation in terms of food and drink, you can avoid being ripped off.",Disneyland_Paris
172614697,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I liked a lot of Disneyland   my youngest son was more than excited. The rides were well laid out  We missed the Parade and Fireworks and I am sure I hear those were two great things, so would have pushed my ratings higher. As in similar posts, crowds, queues and no less than 3 rides breaking down put a slight damper on things. However all things considered, it is what it is and as a visitor you have to accept that. Buy tickets online before you go, you will pay a lot less. Get there at 9.00,even though the part doesn't open till 10am, the ticket queues are there, we got there at 9.20 and were already quite long   even though we had the e ticket you need to exchange for official park ones. We went on Space Mountain which nearly finished me off   so word of caution   it spins up and down. My boys loved it though. The Pirates of Caribbean was very good and we ate in the Blue Lagoon restaurant   a little more up market   the ride goes through the edge of the restaurant. We did the Warner bros tour in the same day   and went to the Stunt Show   a must for everyone. I can see all the kids love the place   so many little girls dressing up for the occasion too. The Park is exceptionally clean too. Lots for adults to see as well. 1 or 2 days enough though..",Disneyland_Paris
172611509,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I may be biased because I've done Disney Florida. The Americans just do this kind if thing sooo much better than the Europeans. There is just no atmosphere and magic sparkle is missing. Attention to detail is not there that make these types of resort so successful. Staff in eateries do not get in the spirit of the Disney. The service and food is fine, but the sparkle is missing. Even Mickey looked as though he was just going through the motions.One or two areas starting to look a little shabby. Can get very busy in the summer; I visited in August and expect to wait 70 minutes for any ride after midday. During our visit rides we had 3 rides break down, one where we were turned away after an hours wait.Have visited here twice, and Florida once, my advice is save your pennies a big longer and go over the pond.",Disneyland_Paris
172589569,3,2013-8,Canada,"I am a HUGE Disney fan, having visited all five main Disney Parks across the globe and have visited Disneyland Park Paris twice with each of my daughters. Although I had reservations the first time visiting I chalked it up to maybe the day but purists beware, although the grounds are Disney and the rides Disney, that special feel that truly sets these parks apart from the rest is not Disney. On both occasions, two of the major rides were broke down (kissed those fast passes goodbye) but what really got me was the staff. I think I saw a couple of them smile but their halfhearted efforts at making this a special day was very noticeable   more like teenagers working the local amusement park. I also could not believe the amount of smoking that went on in the park and although not the parks fault per se, there did not appear to be any effort to address it   this again on both occasions (smokers might like it!). The 45 minute, somewhat expensive train ride to and from Paris kind of adds to it as well but hey, I guess parking at the other Disney Parks is not great eitherStill had fun but please just be aware, especially if travelling a long distance to get here and or having this a main focus of your trip to Paris ( I know, it's sad as it kind of was initially mine as it was the one main park I had not visited) that you may be a little disappointed, especially if you know what to compare it to but if you are with kids, they are going to love it regardless.",Disneyland_Paris
172564500,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Went with my my partner 17,14 and 4 year old. Visited for 2 days the 1st day we went in the afternoon the temperature was 27c and the park was busy myself partner and kids hated it and vowed never to return again. 2nd day we went a lot later on the weather was a bit cooler the park less busy and all of us loved it. Parade was good but the firework were excellent the best bit. I didn't think the food was that expensive but maybe because I prepared myself for it and brought additional snacks in with me. Overall would return but maybe when the weather is colder would rather wrap up then try and hunt for non existent shade. Also waiting times are a lot quieter later on and bring your own water it costs 4 euros in the park.",Disneyland_Paris
172526641,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I'm giving this 4 stars because as a theme park, it's good, but the Disney magic is lost. I went with my 3 and 5 year old with the expectation of the Disney magic being a big factor of our trip. There are NO Disney characters walking about the park, the only way you get to see one is by joining a queue at certain times of the day in various places and in some only having the professional photographer allowed to take a photo of you with the character. This was a real let down. It was incredibly busy for everything, rides, food, toilets etc so be prepared to wait! I would advise getting a spot for the parade about an hour before it starts otherwise expect to be 5 6 people deep, but the parade is fantastic and worth watching   that was when we got our magic! Food and drink is expensive so if you can, take something of your own if you can to save yourself some   's. the shops are expensive for items you would normally buy in the Disney store in the uk for much less. If you stay in any of the Disney hotels you get early entry which I recommend doing, although it is still busy as all the Disney hotels have this facility! Plan your visit before you head into the park so you have your route and rides mapped out in advance so you can maximise your time! Use the fast passes too as this does save you some time. The baby switch is good too.",Disneyland_Paris
172433783,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I agree with Kurple below. You have to go to see it for yourself, definitely not   the happiest place in the world  but certainly the most disappointing. Andby the way, if they say the park shuts at 23pm, well a part of it shuts earlier if there are fireworks that night is what they dont tell you. not that youll want to be there long enough. The food is bad quality, overpriced and you will be queuing for half an hour in the least. I could keep going but id rather just forget..so expensive to go in too! Definitely not worth it.",Disneyland_Paris
172424321,4,2013-8,Canada,"We a family of Disney lovers. We have been to Florida and California, and we knew going in to Paris that it wouldn't really compare...but we went anyway. Couldn't resist. Overall, we had fun. Extremely busy park. Busier than we have ever experienced in North America. The rides are comparable....in terms of thrills, but not in terms of overall ambiance and experience. The Rockin RollerCoaster was great fun, more thrilling than Florida, but runs rougher. Your head bangs around a lot more than I remember from our time at WDW. Space mountain 2 is fabulous for thrills and setting. again, not as smooth, but well worth the wait.The biggest disappointment of the day is the Indiana Jones ride. This is one of my favourite all time rides at Disney California, and I have to say that here in Paris....it isn't great. It shouldn't even be called Indiana Jones. No ambiance, no storyline, nothing that even rings of Indy adventures. It is just a rough roller coaster running around a mountain of some kind. I really think that they should rename it so that people don't get their excitement ramped up, only to find that it has nothing to do with the original ride. Having said that though, I suppose if you have never been to the original maybe you wouldn't be bothered by this version.Overall, the park is fun, but it just doesn't have the 'Special Something' that Disney California or WDW has. Go and have fun but don't expect original Disney feel. :)",Disneyland_Paris

There wasn't a spot of rubbish anywhere at any time and the streets are even hosed clean every morning before they open!! Extra Magic Hours are slightly disappointing, as hardly any rides or shops are open, but still worth it to keep the kids entertained!! We loved the parade at 7pm   really special and the music is FAB!! One tip, if you prepared to get pushed and shoved, save your place for the parade an hour in advance. If you prefer to take a more chilled approach, turn up at 6.50pm and find a spot! We did both and the second approach suited us better as we still had a great view but with far less stress!! The same applies to Dreams. Be prepared to encounter literally thousands of people sitting on the ground. If you can cope with crowds then great, if not, then turn up 15mins before the start and just make do with the spot you get. You may enjoy it more this way!!!All in all, we loved the park and will definitely return as soon as possible!",Disneyland_Paris
172342467,2,2013-8,Sweden,"Visited DisneyLand Paris August (on a Monday) together with my wife and our 3 year old daughter. Took the train from Paris to Disneyland, approximately 40 mins, 2 metro tickets cost 14.90 EUR (oneway). Children under 4 travel free.We arrived there around 10.30. I had booked the tickets online (59 EUR each, children under 3 free entrance).Just before entering the park, there is a huge security checkpoint, they check all of the bags. There were only 4 queues lines for the security check so they were quite long. Anyway, after about 10 mins went through to the turnstiles to enter the park. Out of about 15 turnstiles only about 6 was open but it was not a huge line to enter the park. Once inside we rented a stroller, 15 EUR. If you take the rented stroller between the parks, you need to leave a 70 EUR deposit ( credit card or cash) and show the form to the turnstiles when exiting one park.The park had more adults than children. The queues for the attractions and rides was full of adults, not kids. Which made the lines longer and at the expense of families with kids. Although on the website it indicated designated smoking areas, there were adults smoking all over the place. It was disgusting. Not even in Paris did i experience so many smokers in one place. And not a single Disney personel to tell them they cannot smoke in un designated areas. I understand even an adult would want to experience Disneyland, but then get them to pay for it rather than just going to every ride at the expense of children.The Disney Park is mostly just shops, with Disney merchandise. Once you enter these you have to buy something, cause it is rather tempting the way they display them. The attractions are not at all what i imagined they would be. Very poorly maintained. Went through the Wild West area, it was just some empty deserted buildings, with nothing interesting to see. I saw 3 disney people wearing cowboy jackets and a toy pistol sidearm. And they were just walking not doing any sort of act. Boring.The Disney castle is tiny, I always imagined it to be much bigger, the way they advertise it.Not a single parade. Where are all of the disney characters ??? where is the magic ??? The spirit of Disney ? I only saw one disney character, Winnie the pooh, the wait time for the queue to see him was about 30 mins. Didn't wait as it was too long. Not one single other disney character was seen for the almost 3 4 hours we walked about and spent in queues. The queue time for the other attractions was a minimum of 30 mins, going upto at least 1 hour for the train rides. The smallest wait time was for the boat ride which was about 10 mins.Ate 3 hotdogs, just a plain bun with an undercooked sausage, 6.80 EUR each. No mustard sauce, just some ketchup.The walt disney studios is the same. Nothing to see, not at all interesting. All of the queues to the attractions are full of adults, the kids have to wait.Would i go again ? No way, absolute waste of money, waste of time and waste of energy. Don't waste your money on this scam, visit some of the other Paris sites like Asterix Park. And enjoy Disney on TV. The park was supposed to be magical, it brought us down to reality.Was a total disappointment.",Disneyland_Paris
172322630,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"What's not to love! Disney characters, a big pink castle, rides in abundance! We have been 6 times, soon to be 7 and we loive this place more each time!",Disneyland_Paris
172293716,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"The ironic thing is that there is very little for children to do whilst waiting for your turn on the rides   very difficult trying to keep children entertained whilst they are stuck in a queue for over an hour, shuffling forward at a couple of steps per minute.The like of the kiddies rides, Dumbo and such, a whopping 90 seconds or so long, all have around 60 to 90 minutes waiting time.Absolute killer prices for bottled water, juice, tea and the likes   which you'll need plenty of in the height of Summer   3 Euros a pop!The crowd control measures are completely disheartening, the presence of French military around the RER (Railway station at the park gates) armed with fully automatic weapons, bag searches and x rays for everybody (including bum bags) does become the norm, which is very unfortunate too. If you can afford the  fast pass  this will reduce you waiting time by around 90%, but, and a very big but, you can only use the fast pass one ride at a time   you are allotted a return time which is great but it may be 2 or three hours away   you can't use the fast pass again until you have been on that ride.If you're hoping your kids will see the best Disney characters from the last five or six years   forget it. No Iron Man, no Minions.Blackpool or Alton bloody Towers next time",Disneyland_Paris
172286783,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"First hint is to buy your tickets on line beforehand...you will save at least 15 20 Euros per ticket.Try to get to the park by 9am (9.30am at the latest) There will be queues to get in already and the walk from the car park to the attraction is not insignificant! The park opens at 10am but even with a prepaid ticket you will be in a queue to get it validated. If you have little ones then either take a push chair for them   even if they are usually out of it...the day is a really long one and they will totally flake out waiting for the parades and the light show (which is really late) You can hire a pushchair if you need to (again prebook this online if required)Take snacks and water drinks...we were told not to do this as your bags were checked but it is fine to do and with kids it is a must!...food is expensive, and the queues are VERY slow.Take warm clothes for the little ones, especially if you are planning on staying for the light show...which is WELL worth it (especially the 20th anniversary show which is AMAZING) but it doesn't start until 11pm and the kiddies get cold and tired waiting!The parade of Disney Characters is at 7pm every day and the best view is from the 'Main Street Station' (near where you enter the park) and go up the stairs to get the best view! Little ones will LOVE it!!A good place to view the 11pm light show is at the Castle Theatre stage (to the right of the Disney Castle as you look at it) BUT...word of warning...stay to the left side as the right hand side ends up being cordoned off at about 10.30pm. You need to get there at about 10pm to be sure of a seat! (there are some benches there   we got there at about 9.30 and got the front row!)On a positive note, the way that the park 'exits' at the end of the evening is pretty slick, you'd be surprised at how quickly you are able to get to your car and leave the site..after being stuck in queues to leave Legoland, Drayton Manor and Chessington, EuroDisney was a delight!The whole event is definitely well worth a visit (don't forget the Studios) but definitely PLAN your day to make the best of it...we went with a little one (aged 5) and two teenagers who wanted to do all the 'fast rides'...we found our best bet was to let the older ones go off and queue for the fast rides and we all met up at certain points and times during the day..mobiles are VITAL!",Disneyland_Paris
172275637,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Please read all of this review, it   s written as a parent who went to DLRP with open eyes, not a grown adult with the mentality of a six year old. We paid a lot of money for our stay there (my wife, I and our 6 year old daughter) and there are many things wrong with the resort than are right. I don   t know where to start, so I   ll get the obvious out of the way first, but I   ll come back to one point. Firstly, queues are going to be a given and they are going to be long, end of. Secondly, prices, anybody who goes to DLRP and doesn   t (or even does) expect it to be expensive is deluding themselves and there   s no point in complaining about it, that   s the way it is, end of, get used to it, they want your money, and you   ll give it to them (you already have).OK, the gripes. Firstly, 99.9% of the staff look miserable, bored, and sullen and can be rude. They really haven   t taken on the Disney customer service ethos. It   s difficult to find one who smiles (I saw two or three), they don   t try to make eye contact or speak English, which reminds me of another point thank you. They are there doing their job, they get paid minimum wage and generally give minimum service. The two we had good experiences of went out of their way to help us, and we were very grateful for their help, but they were the exceptions rather than the norm. Secondly, the park looks old, dated, tatty, and a bit worn out. OK, it   s been open 21 years, but it doesn   t look like some of the park hasn   t had a lick of paint since it was opened. The toilets show the signs of well used toilets, often smelly and wet underfoot (I can   t speak for the ladies obviously), but regular checks seem to be lacking.Thirdly, DLRP apparently has a    No smoking    rule in the park, this is woefully disregarded and completely unenforced. Why grown people want to walk around a theme park designed for the enjoyment of children either holding a burning cigarette at child head height or waving it about, or even whilst waiting in the queues, is really beyond me, if you NEED to smoke, go out of the park and do it there for Gods sake, we observed cigarette ends everywhere, and I mean everywhere, it looks disgusting, we even saw children playing with them, which ok, is the parents fault for not stopping them, but if they weren   t there in the first place, problem solved. The smoking issue also cast a dark shadow on our holiday when one of our neighbours across the channel waved his cigarette around, burning our daughters brand new Disney toy, this might seem trivial, but for one thing it cost 26euros and was ruined, and secondly, if she hadn   t been holding the toy the way she was, his cigarette would have burned its way into her eye. Smoking in such a crowded park is an issue DLRP needs to address. Fourthly, queues (again) and rides, DLRP seems to have taken    how to make things not be seen    lessons from the SAS, short queues are deceiving, the real queue is generally hidden from view round a corner until you are actually committed to be in it. The times shown are completely inaccurate, for example, the waiting time for the    Tower of terror    was shown to be 35mins, when in fact it was probably twice that long, the    fast pass    system for that ride had been closed, so it was decided that there was no time for it. The queue for    Crush   s Coaster    ride was 80mins long, again too long for a six year old to stand in. DLRP needs to put some sort of entertainment in place for the long queues, it was suggested in another review that some video screens showing cartoons in the longer queues might be the way forward and I agree. The rides seemed to be poorly maintained, (   Thunder mountain    broke down while we were there and this is apparently a regular thing), and often a waste of time, we queued for near on an hour to go on the    Cars rally    ride, half of the ride   s cars were out of operation, and the safety checks for the ride actually lasted longer than the ride itself. The Carousel de Lancelot, although there was no queue, only lasted a turn and a half, again nowhere near as long as the safety checks. You need to be paying attention if there are any announcements, they will always be in French first and rushed English second (if at all), the first attraction we went through, the spoken parts were completely in French, luckily the queen of hearts really only said one thing, so we could guess, but our six year old daughter? We also took in the stunt show in the studio, the cast members seemed to sometimes forget that they weren   t catering to a completely French audience, forgetting at times to translate, and blabbering away in French while the English were left to guess what they were saying. There was also one point when Lightning McQueen turned up, Mater was on the big screen talking in French while Lightning spoke English, what was the point of that? When we went to the    Armageddon    attraction, the cast member decided that because there were more French people than any other race in our group she would talk solely French and we were left to read the screens to find out what was going on, the attraction turned out to be THE biggest waste of time, avoid it at all costs, it really is time best spent elsewhere, probably the queue for another ride. DLRP needs to decided which language it wants to use and stick to it.The good points were the parades which our daughter really enjoyed and the    Disney dreams    show at park closing time which was utterly magical, but you need to get there well on time to appreciate, again however, it was a mix of French and English talking which seemed a bit pointless. The people who say this resort is a magical, wonderful place are either obviously really easily pleased and as I have said, have the mentality of a six year old, or have too much bloody money and don   t care about its failings. Disney should have walked away from this place when it had the chance. This review will be followed up by an email to DLRP, which if their cast member   s attitudes are anything to go by, will be promptly deleted.",Disneyland_Paris
172263123,3,2013-8,Australia,"I visited with my family, this was our third visit to the park and as always we had a great time.However, more regular maintenance is needed to avoid the park becoming tired. After 20 years of operation the amount of maintenance I saw taking place is not enough to keep up with what needed doing. Also, several rides were non operational at different times during our stay.You definitely need more than one day to get the most out of this attraction. If you can make it here than it is a great experience.",Disneyland_Paris
172259707,5,2013-8,Switzerland,"I will not really talk about the park and the attractions as many have done this. What I will do is give the tricks to get in the parks for about half price.First, you need to do what we did not do: Plan, Plan, PlanYou need to buy your tickets online at least 7 days prior to arriving at the park. Online, you can choose that you are from the  Ile de France . Choose 1 day 1 park, with the 7 days delay option and Voila, half price.It is also cheaper to do 1 day 1 park than 2 days 2 parks. This does mean that in one day, you cannot switch over the other side. But, plan, plan, plan!!!As for food, if you want something else than buggers, you absolutely need to RESERVE in the more fancy restaurants. There are many places to reserve, the main entrance, by phone or even via the Disney Hotels. You can also get the APP for iPhone, you get the phone of each food joint. I suggest the Silver Spur Steakhouse... fraken good smell calling you from miles away!Also, the Moteurs...  Action! Stunt Show Spectacular  is awesome! Wait around a bit at the end of the show and get to go on the field for a photo shoot with the stunt drivers.",Disneyland_Paris

Watch the parade from the train station queuing area   great view! The fabulous, amazing lazer firework show. Well worth staying late for.Cons: price of food drink   walk out to Disney village and eat at MacDonalds. DON'T queue for the train   we were told an hour and after 1 1 2 hours we had to leave the queue to watch the parade! Never enough time   you need at least 3 days to do both parks and more if you want your children to collect the characters autographs! Probably not enough 'scary' rides for teenagers but magical for younger children",Disneyland_Paris
172214740,4,2013-7,Spain,"Being a regular visitor to Magic Kingdom in WDW Orlando, this park looks small. My kids loved it, long waiting times for the  main  attractions, but traveling with small children we didn't have much interest in those. A lot to do for the kids. Get fast passes for the Fantasyland main attractions (Peter Pan, Snow White, etc) or wait for very late in the afternoon, but keep in mind that Fantasyland closes earlier because of the Anniversary Show.The 20th Anniversary Show is at 11 pm, gets very crowded and best viewing areas are occupied very, very early. With small children it is hard to maintain the energy so late. We managed to view the show two times. A lot is happening at the bottom of the castle, keep that in mind for selecting your viewing location.We visit the park 4 days, one whole morning just to visit the Disney Princesses (only one), but really worth it. Get the photos from Disney and enjoy the moment with your kids.Loved the place, but more shows are needed, probably all the resources went into the Anniversary Show, as nothing happened during the day.We will certainly come back, probably for Christmas time.",Disneyland_Paris
172211385,5,2013-7,United States,I am a Disney fan and wanted to see Disneyland Paris. This park made the uncomfortable hotel accommodations probably worth the trip. Pirates of the Caribbean was the best ride and better than WDW or DL.,Disneyland_Paris

172154717,1,2013-8,Canada,"Oh boy where do I begin!! This park should in no way associate itself with the Disney name. I get the long queues and the throngs of people   what I don't get Is the lack of signage or disney guides; the restaurants closing at 5pm   And I distinctly remember the restaurant manager saying 'we are one of the lucky few that get to close early daily.' They should have a limit on daily visitors because queues were ridiculous and wait times were but a lie. Rides saying 20 min wait were really a 40 min wait. My 2 little girls couldnt even visit the princess pavilion because there were 3 separate queues to get tickets   what???? 1) You shouldn't have to spend on tickets to meet disney characters after paying hefty sums at the entrance and 2) everyone should have access to them abd not have to queue for 3 4 hours to get 'tickets' to see them. I even overheard people with tickets being told they had to further wait and to come back after 30 40 mins, by rude obnoxious staff! Everything was overpriced   kids toys, costumes and even the food   and they all were of the worst quality. This place needs to be inspected by proper disney authorities and shut down, it is not living up to the Disney name.

172121758,4,2013-7,United States,"We recently visiting Disneyland for 2 days with our teenage daughters. We were slightly let down by the experience, probably because we have spent so much time at Disney World and this really does not compare. Before arriving I thought it would be like Disneyland California, but it was not as good. The rides were great and the lines were tolerable especially being high season. But the cast members do not go out of their way for guests and in fact are many times rude to guests. I frequently observed the staff member  fooling around  with each other instead of doing their job. There also seemed to be an issue to maintenance of the rides with frequent breakdowns. During extra magic hours a lot of the rides are not open. We did not see the night show because it was so late (11:00pm) due to the area not getting dark until that late in the summer. Also the park opens late, 10:00 am.We are glad we saw it, but will probably never return.",Disneyland_Paris

172107768,3,2013-8,United Kingdom,"We expected queues....and to be honest, day 1 in the Disney park wasn't too bad ( a Monday), we got on most things ( with a 5 and 8 year old)... It's nice that the park really goes quiet after 8pm. Get your fast passes for thunder mountain as that is pretty much the only family roller coaster you can ride on ( space mountain has a strict 1.3m height). Be prepared to be ripped off for coffees, popcorn etc but go with the flow ( we sneaked sandwiches and crisps in). Day 2   universal studios....what a LET DOWN...hubby and I came here 10 years ago add it hasn't changed....massive queues for everything. You can only get fast passes for about 3 rides, and the kids rides in toy story land had HUGE queues. The toilets were smelly and wet floors after 2pm, avoid...and the food facilities were over crowded and some were shut...seriously Disney, this is not what we expect for a busy August visit, after spending 500 euros for a family of 4 for 2 days. The studio tour is absolutely rubbish ...not a patch on the Florida tour....the only decent part was the burning tanker....other than that, it's not worth the hour or so queue. My advice....run in early, grab a fast lass for tower of terror as that is the only amazing thing at universal, and spend the rest if the day in Disney. Don't get me wrong, we had run, but the studios is busy busy busy, and quite stressful.",Disneyland_Paris
172053115,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,Second visit to this park and it seems to have had a bit of renovation everywhere was spotlessly clean and the staff were all happy and friendly.We were lucky with the weather and at some times it almost felt like we were in Florida.It was very good and hope to be back again soon,Disneyland_Paris
172041740,1,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I'm not sure where to start to say how dissappointed we were with this visit. The park is dirty, the toilets are dirty, there is smoking everywhere   the non smoking policy isn't enforced, there is queue jumping, weeds growing on the rides, the food is poor quality and the cost is excessive. My advice would be save your money and go to Florida, at least they know how to run a park and make it an unforgettable experience.Ok, so we decided rather last minute to pop in here as part of our holiday, we bought a 2 day 2 park ticke for 2 adults and 2 children on the door at just over Euro 500. Plus we paid Euro 15 per day for parking. Fine, we've been to disney in Florida and we don't mind paying for something good. Judging by the car park the park was only half full, but it seemed rammed, went on a ride with a 35 minute queue time and queued for an hour, it then became aparent that the queue times at the front of the rides are a load of rubbish. Plus you have to have your wits about you in the queue as the families behind constantly try to slink past you, probably because you are having a caughing fit because the people in front are smoking, even though it's not allowed. We dreaded having to use the toilets, didn't see a cleaner once and at least 50% were unusable due to being flooded or just filthy. Graffiti all over them and dirty toilet paper on the floor. Disgusting. The cost for coffee and sort drinks was between 3 and 4 euros. I know these parks have to make some money, but really, the cost v the quality was a rip off. Went into Planet Hollywood to eat, it cost us over   100 for 2 children and 2 adults and we didn't bother to stay for dessert as the service was so slow.

We got loads of pictures at the meet and greet each morning all free. The Disney parks are so much fun and so well run, clean, friendly and we did not find it expensive.

171945291,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"The place just makes you smile. Our daughter loved the visiting the princesses, Mickey Mouse and the characters that appeared at several locations throughout the day. There is a full range of rides on offer, from the Mad Hatters Teacups to Thunder Mountain.The staff were excellent and it is obvious that their primary goal is to make sure hat everyone leaves with a smile on their face.We didn't get a chance to explore Frontierland or Adventureland as we were so busy in Fantasyland (known in our house as Princessland) and Discoveryland.Eating can be a bit of a logistical nightmare, especially in an evening. Lunchtime food is generally fast food, but the evening meals have a reasonable choice. Due to the Disney parade at 19:00 we found that eating at 17:30 worked well. The Agrabah Cafe was our favourite place to eat in the three days we were there. The Disney parade and the closing time firework display are excellent.Definitely a must do if you have young girls into Disney.Rather than return we will be trying the Florida Disneyland next time, as we don't feel that going again would feel as special.",Disneyland_Paris

I was pleased to see maintenance being done around the park, decorators were painting buildings and railings and gardeners re planting beds and parts of attractions.

171640495,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"The park is amazing, its like stepping into a different world. If your staying in one of the disney hotels you can enter the park at 8 10 before general admission. This is well worth getting up for as the majority of fantasyland rides are open (stuff for the smaller children) and the buzz lightyear ride which always had a hour queue through the day we just walked on again and again and again  you get the picture!!If you want to see any princesses prepare to queue. You queue at the windmill in fantasyland for a ticket to get a time to go back and queue to see a princess (you dont get to choose which one you see). If you meet any characters there is usually a photographer there, they give you a card with you pics saved upto 7 days and the more you buy the cheaper it is so dont get rushed into buying a 15 euro pic  at the end we got 3 for 23 euros. The dresses in the shops are a rip off all priced at 60 euros so we took some with us to ensure we were not cohursed by our 3 year old to buy any more. The fireworks are AMAZING!!! But get a seat early, we got seated on the grass at 9pm and it was getting busy then.The parade is great but again a rush for pavement space (book walts restaurant as you can watch the parade from the window. Oh and book your tables at restaurants before you go....they get booked up!!Honestly this is just a super experience for anyone young or old. I almost cried when leaving.",Disneyland_Paris

Technology has progressed, kids have high expectations nowadays. I am sorry but a mechanised pirate of the carribean that only moves in one direction cannot be considered as adequate in the 21st century. And as far as the fast rides are concerned there are only 4 of them. One in each adventure land... Disappointed. Maybe only good for the under 13s.",Disneyland_Paris

171605692,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Having been to Disney World in America twice, you feel that nothing can quite compare to it from then on, and most people would shrug the idea of DisneyLand Paris off. However, I thought I would give it a go this year for my boyfriends birthday!Three words... It was amazing. Even though it was just the two of us, both being 24, we had an amazing day, with loads to do and see. Our tickets were for both parks, which are right next door to each other, so that was a bonus. We went during the summer holidays, and although there were a lot of people around, the most we queued for one ride was 25minutes. It's really easy to get to by train, and not expensive either.My only issue would be with the ride  space mountain 2  The seats were really uncomfortable and your head is literally banged from side to side with the rapid movements of the ride. I've been on many rolls coasters in different theme parks, but this ride would definitely be number one for discomfort.",Disneyland_Paris

171566155,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"I travelled here with my husband and my 2 daughters. Until you have actually been here, you can not explain how wonderful this place really is. The atmosphere and the sheer volume of people is just out of this world. The days are very long and tiring, walking around all day and queuing. I have never seen so many people in all my life. The rides are ones which i have never been on before in my life, absolutely awesome. Space mountain, pirates of the caribbean, buzz lightyear, i could go on all day. The rides are for people of all ages. The park is very pricey, 3 euros for a bottle of coke or water and you can not get it from anywhere else, so make sure you take plenty of spends.The firework display is at 11pm everynight, it is totally magical and something which i have never seen before. We have now come back and we are already thinking of booking for next year.I could not come here for longer than a few days as i could not hardly walk on the day i come home.My 2 daughters were totally taken back by the whole experience. All in all an awesome experience and i would definately go back.",Disneyland_Paris
171512945,1,2013-8,Canada,"To say I am disappointed is an under statement. I have wasted lots of cash in my life, but I felt Disney France was a rip off of gigantic proportions. To pay huge sums of money for tickets for kids and not be able to use them in any of the rides is NOT fair. To stand in queue for over an hour, then to get into one of the rides for just over a minute is not right. They MUST find a solution as I had a couple of very disappointed kids.To hardly have any signage in the park is not right, to have a website and an app designed by immatures is a crime. To go to a restaurant at 4.55 pm and to be told cant serve you as we close at five is strange. To go to another restaurant and stand in a queue for 30 minutes to place an order and pay is stupid, especially when there are many staff there doing nothing and when asked to have another cashier, I was given the shrugged shoulder.This place needs major overhaul and re organization, to make me stand in three queues just to get access to the princess pavilion irritated me and made me promise myself that I would be Disneylands Europe worst ambassador and make sure I tell everyone I know (and those I don't ) that the place does not deserve to have the Disney name associated with it. I will never visit this place again, unless I know there has been major changes.",Disneyland_Paris

171456978,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"How do you review this sort of place? As an adult it's a bloody nightmare, but as a child under 6 it's a wonder land. And that's who it's for so you have to put up with the other stuff. We went in August, so obviously there was loads of queuing, but I wish they would put something there to occupy the kids for half an hour or so. A few DVD screens showing a Disney cartoon would help immensely. We were told about the Fast pass, but that still meant queuing for at least 15 minutes, and on one occasion the Fast pass was for 5 in the afternoon, and we were there at 2   so 3 hours away.It's not Florida, obviously, but...it's not Florida! The Americans have got a lot of that sorted, but then again they are 3000 miles and   6000 away, so I suppose you get what you pay for.The rating of 4 stars is from the kids, not me.",Disneyland_Paris

I suggest you get to the park before 10am and make your way to your favourite rides immediately as within an hour there can be over an hours wait for a ride that lasts 3 minutes.Dont expect to get any cheap or healthy food we paid 23 euros for an adult buffet and 15 euros for the children.Missed the parade and fireworks as too tired. If you want to do these, the parade is at 7pm weather permitting and the fireworks at closing time. Go back to your hotel in the afternoon for a rest then re enter the park before 7pm.Make sure when you enter the park not only get a map of the area but also a programme then you can plan your day around meeting the disney characters and parades.All in all a good experience.",Disneyland_Paris

171421459,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"My last Disneyland Paris review concentrated on tickets, so this time I   ll give some top tips about the parades and the night time Disney Dreams show. If you do these wrong, it can be an infuriating experience     it is an English tradition to queue and respect the space of others, but this tradition is not shared by many other nationalities, so if you think you can get a good space and keep it without someone else somehow spoiling it, forget it!Disney Stars in Cars in Disney Studios is the easiest. You   ll see the route it follows on the park map, but in real terms, there are grey squares with stars in the pavement marking the route. The views are pretty good right along the route, so about 30 40 minutes before parade time, find one of these stars and sit behind it     the stewards will move you back if you try and sit on it (and will make you stand up anyway when the parade starts) but make sure you   ve got a    pitch    wide enough for all your kids. Inevitably, another child will squeeze into your space with a parent stood behind you, but just accept that this is par for the course. On a really hot day when you need shade, the only real place is the shadow of the information kiosk to the left as you look at the statue of Walt Disney, with your back to the plaza building, but this space fills up extra early.For the main park Disney parade, you need to watch the contour of the route when planning where to go     we   ve learned to accept that you might not get a view right down the road of the floats coming, but if you get a good view straight in front of you, that   s great. A really good spot to stand in is behind the pillar near the side entrance to Fantasyland (near the Auberge de Cendrillon, and on the opposite side from the cooling water jets). Sure, you don   t get a good advance view as the pillar is in the way, but neither do you get too much jostling, as no one tries to squeeze between you and the pillar!Disney Dreams can be an absolute nightmare, especially with children, but with some forward planning, you can get the best view in the park. You   ll need: anti insect spray, long sleeved tops and hoodies (to cover as much flesh as you can!), a waterproof mat and a lot of patience. The problem with Disney Dreams is that everyone wants a good view     I   m tall, so can usually find one, but you know that in most of the pavement areas, someone with a small child wearing a huge princess dress will pop her on their shoulders right in front of you blocking your whole view. And when your kids then start to whine that they can   t see anything, you are forced to do the same. So, at 9.15pm (assuming an 11pm show), with the castle in front of you, head to the left. Behind the metal railing is a grass bank (or mud bank if the weather has been wet, hence the waterproof mat), and at the top of the bank is a very prickly bush. This is the highest point in the viewing area. Reserve your space, and prepare for a long wait. Take games, picnics, etc. to pass the time, but remember to coat yourself in citronella to keep the biting bugs at bay. Ideally, you   ll want to stay seated, but realistically, everyone in front of you will end up standing so you   ll be forced to your feet, too. As you are at the top of the bank (and it is quite steep!), you   ll have the best view of the show, and no one behind you prodding and pushing for a better view. Enjoy!",Disneyland_Paris
171368657,2,2013-8,United Kingdom,"This was a long awaited day trip that missed the mark for us. It came at the end of a 5 day trip to Paris and sadly it was a very expensive and disappointing day. Very lengthy queues for all attractions, many at well over an hour and the parks were extremely crowded. There was little accurate information at the start of the rides as to waiting times. We only managed 6 rides across the two parks in 9 hours although what we went on were very good   Rock n rollercoaster was the best. Few visible disney characters around the park.The park in places is looking a bit shabby and needs a facelift. Food was tasty but at 45 Euros for in effect a Mcdonalds meal, this was not good value. Take drinks and snacks.We had visited disney before here and in the States but we wont be visiting again. Our Disney dream is over.",Disneyland_Paris
171290288,5,2013-7,Norway,Would avoid coming here during the peak season which is July. Be prepared to stand in line for 30 60 min. Best thing to do is to plan the visit before getting there.,Disneyland_Paris
171289395,5,2013-7,Romania,"I went to this park with my husband and although we are both in our late 20s, we had a lot of fun. There are attractions for any age.We spent an entire day in the two parks riding all sorts of montagne russe (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril, Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain   don't eat before riding them!), entering the Phantom Manor, cruising with a large boat or circling the park with the train. We were extremely lucky as the lines were not long and we didn't have to use the Fast Passes.My husband also liked Frontierland Shootin' Arcade for which he had to pay 2 euro. Isn't the price of the ticket enough to cover this attraction as well?!?There are 2 extremely colourful parades, interesting particularly for children. The main parade occurs in the evening, around 7.00 p.m., but be sure to arrive earlier in order to pick a good spot for photos as it gets extremely crowded! If you want to buy souvenirs, there are a lot of shops both inside and outside the parks, but beware that the price of certain items vary from one shop to the other, as well as the available merchandise!All in all, it was a fun day and I would definitely return!Pros:  attractions for any age  colourful attractions  cheerful parades  lots of souvenir shopsCons:  crappy overpriced restaurants (14 euro person for inedible fast food)  very crowded in July  overpriced souvenirs  no wi fi anywhere, not even in restaurants",Disneyland_Paris

The park it self is very clean, lot of fun attractions for smaller children (and scared adults). I don't think this park is very fun for older kids teens. BUT if you don't have to travel here in July, DON'T! It was hot and crowded. Some attractions had up to 60 minutes wait, but the fast pass tickets worked fine. We had 4 days, and that was good. Then we didn't have to hurry around. Be at the park 30 20 min before opening, then you don't have to stand in line for the security check. Bring your own food and waterbottles. The long lines for buying food was not worth it, food was terrible! There are lots of places to sit down and enjoy your own cheap food, rather spend your money on buying water and soda and icecream. There are lots of waterstations to fill up your waterbottles. We recommend to walk to Frontierland, close to Cowboy Cookout Barbecue. Lots of shadow, quiet and good places to sit and enjoy your own food. All in all, a good experience, but stay away in July (and propably August) if you can.",Disneyland_Paris
171104986,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,"I checked all the really useful tips on here and make notes on best ride times lengths height restrictions, etc from the dlpr website to take in with me. It was a godsend! We managed to see and do everything in the main park in 1 day! It was extremely hot, we took small fruit shoot bottles (one filled with cordial) and one large water bottle and refilled them constantly thru the day at the many water fountains. It saved us a small fortune! Food is pricey to say the least, we packed snacks and kept the kids topped up to avoid energy slumps and they did brilliantly, no naps 10am 11.50pm and our kids are 4, 6 & 8 so that's saying something! 15 euros to park the car ( don't forget to make a note of your car park space!) and we paid 15 euro each for two hired buggies for our little ones, which was well worthwhile, they had a step for the older child to get a ride on too. These doubled up as seating for the parade and night show and saved our arms from carrying tired little peeps, plus you can motor on to the next destination without worrying about their walking speed. Shops were expensive, but a little souvenir is a must isn't it! We got on most rides in reasonable times, fast passed once for buzz lightyear and it was still a lengthy queue so we judged that right. Thunder mountain broke down just before our fast pass time, which was a shame and Indiana Jones wasn't running that day. We briefly saw Donald Duck and his family but no other characters walking around. Didn't meet & greet as there was just so much we wanted to do. We ate at the Planet Hollywood in the Disney village straight after the 7pm parade and were served quickly, giving us time to fill up, re energise and get back to main street to choose our night time spot, which filled up fast. Best bit of my day? Seeing the look on my kids faces during the light show...just magical!",Disneyland_Paris

My niece is disabled and she got taken care of really well. Unfortunately I did feel that some parts the parks were slightly unorganised. I was a little disapointed that the parks didn't live up to my expectations. But overall it was a well worth it trip for my Niece who deserved to see Disney.,Disneyland_Paris
170987130,4,2013-5,Ireland,"Visited for a third time at the start of this summer with the kids (have posted previously)Found cheap week online in start of May and felt this would be perfect to avoid summer crowdsOn the plane over read that this week had two French bank holidays and that it would motivate many French to take the entire week off (they called it a 'viaduct')The Park was packed   min 60 min queue for almost everything. Even the most innocous ride or attraction had a queue (Alison in Wonderland Maze had a waiting time!). All of the restaurants (and I mean all), had 60 min waiting times as well. Showed me what summer is like.In a whole day, we got to do c. 4 5 rides.The issue is that when the kids in Paris are off school, they flock to the Park and pack it out. They don't care about the crowds as it is just a day trip and they will have paid almost nothing for the ticket. There are loads of signs around the outside of the Park selling year passes really cheaply (it is like a day at the zoo!). If you live in Paris, there are options during the year to get passes even cheaper. The food is expensive in the resort so I guess this is how Disney need to make money. Unfortunately, if you have travelled and paid money to stay in their hotels, the experience will not be poor (our hotel was not that busy).The difference between the Park when the French kids are at school is 'night & day'. We went in Feb a few years ago and it was brilliant (loads of rides etc.)We went in early May last year (French kids mostly still at school and avoided the bank holiday weeks) and was also really goodThis year we got nailed by going near a French bank holiday (when the French take other days off)   BEWARE, it has such a huge impact on the trip, make sure you avoid them. You may see (as we did) that the prices are even cheaper that week but you have been warned!",Disneyland_Paris
170899524,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"As an adult and having not visited a Disney Themed Attraction for 15 years I was not disappointed by the glitz and glamour of Disneyland Paris. The European experience is slightly different of that of the US, the whole 'Welcome to Disney, have a nice day' is lacking somewhat, but I thought I would highlight some tips for you all to enjoy a stress free experience of Disney. There were 14 of us in our party including children and we had a thoroughly nice time. Tip 1    make use of the Disney Magic hours if you are staying in any of the Disney Resorts. The park is open from 8am   10am for all resort guests. Only 2 lands are open, Fantasyland and FrontierLand at this time. However, not all rides within these lands are open, but rides like Peter Pans Flight, Dumbo, the carousel and Space Mountain are available to enjoy during these hours. All other rides and lands open at 10am. This saves queuing once the park is open to the public (10am) and allows you faster access time to other rides, especially if you are travelling with smaller children. For example, we hopped on Peter Pan's flight at 9am, onto the Carousel and then were straight onto Snow White and Pinochio and had experienced all of these by 10:15. This also allows you time to leisurely stroll without being suffocated by huge crowds gunning for the major attractions.Tip 2    Make use of the drinking water fountains within most of the rest room areas. We filled our water bottles up constantly throughout the day. Soft drinks, including water and sodas etc are 3 euros a drink. The weather was extremely hot and this was a godsend for us all. Tip 3    If money is no object then ignore this next tip, but we took nibbles and drinks into the park for daytime munching. Euro Disney is not a cheap experience once inside the park. A hotdog from Casey's corner is 7 euros and a burger, fries and a drink is around 14 euros from the fast food restuarants. There are various eating establishments that offer buffets within the park for around 24 euros for adults and 14 euros for children, but with 14 in our party this was going to be expensive. Outside the park, Disney Village hosts various restuarants and a McDonalds Happy Meal is around 4.50 Euros. Tip 4    Fast Track Tickets, included within your daily ticket   2 rides per day per ticket, so use these for the more popular attractions allowing you to go onto other rides and come back. I used my fast track for Star Tours, hopped onto Space Mountain in the meantime and was on the ride within 5 mins with my fast pass ticket. Tip 5    Plan your route and what you want to go on in advance. The park is vast and queues are likely, although our longest waiting time was 45 mins for Thunder Mountain and this was bang in the middle of the day. Our group split to ensure we all experienced everything we wanted to go on. Tip 6    Enter the park to the far right of the Disney Hotel, as far right as you can go. Most people head through the centre underneath the hotel. This will assist in avoiding a bottle neck at the entry booths. Tip 7    There are bag checks before you enter the park. The main entrance gets crowded, right near the station, but head for the far right of the main bag check and there is another bag check point which didnt seem to very busy. Enjoy Disney ..... a great place for all the family",Disneyland_Paris
170898332,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,We had 3 nights at Euro Disney in the park with a package that include that include room pass and 2 meals The hotel was in a great location and just as they said within as easy walk to the park   in fact better to walk than get the bus. When we where booked in we where given pass and tickets for our meals no information on what type of food or how busy a passing guest told us to book our evening meals   good job otherwise we would not have got in.The room was ok however no instruction on how to work the air conditioning would have been helpful as it was very hot   worked it out but was so loud had to turn it off. There is internet access but is very poorThe park itself is as it says magic apart from the fact that it is supposed to be a non smoking site and I would have thought it would have been policed   its not. the food in the park is very expensive and all the same as we had paid for our evening meal not as much as of an issue however the choice on that menu was bland and cheap   Not good.The characters and getting autographs is a big part of the attraction not enough of them going round and the same ones.There where lots of rides with long waiting time which we expected but not the rides breaking down all the time with 3 days in the park expected to get on every ride we wanted but as they where breaking down all the time this did not happenMake sure you get the shuttle bus to the airport Overall great time was had by my daughter but could have been a lot better with a few more improvements,Disneyland_Paris

The place is spotless, plenty of places to eat   even if it is mainly fast food   you won't go hungry. Food not cheap   but that's about all you need to pay for except for any souvenirs which are very expensive. Although there was lots and lots of people the queues were nothing like we were expecting. Maximum time was 15 to 20 minutes and they are so well organised getting people off one side of a ride and on the other. The parade was brilliant although we were disappointed that a lot of grown ups stood up in front of the children and even when asked were reluctant to let them through to the front. All in all a fantastic day. Do try and get tickets on line before you go as there is quite a good saving.",Disneyland_Paris

170795389,5,2013-8,United Kingdom,"Fifteen years since last trip to Euro Disney but been to the park in Florid twice inbetween, was worried this might be a pale imitation but not at all. Children aged 18, 9 and 6 all really loved the whole experience from the gates opening at 10:00 to the end of the light show at about 23:30. The queues for the big rides were reasonable even during the middle of the day especially with an occasional use of fastpass. Late in the evening (after the parade) queues for most rides disappeared. Parade and light show were well worth watching, thought the younger children might be grumpy and tired by eleven pm but not at all and they loved it. Only downside was very long queue to meet the princess and lack of characters to meet through the day, autograph books were not worth buying as there was virtually no one to meet.",Disneyland_Paris
170759890,5,2013-6,United Kingdom,"I've visited three Disneyland Parks ( California, Florida and Paris)on several occasions over the years. They're very similar although California has the best weather for a park like this and also has a couple more attractions such as the Jungle Cruise which are not found in Paris. That said, Disneyland Paris has greatly improved since my first visit in 94. As ever the entire park is immaculately clean and visitors bags are scanned at the entrance. The atmosphere is quite enchanting in that you habitually hear some good old favourite tunes such as 'By the Light of the Silvery Moon' etc as you walk around.My favourite rides and that of my family will always be Pirate of the Caribbean; Phantom Mansion; Small World; Star Wars, and Indiana Jones Temple of Doom.The staff are pleasant and helpful and unlike my first visit, there are no longer any wasps around food areas in summer. It's also great exercise walking for miles around the different themed 'lands.' You need at least 3 days to take it all in and don't miss the character parades( great for photos) and the fireworks display. Disneyland is great for kids but also for us adult kids too. Best to visit the Paris park when the weather is good... it does make a difference. I have this quaint theory that if the world leaders spent a couple of days here together, they might work out their differences. Well done Walt... a true visionary.",Disneyland_Paris
170732452,4,2013-8,United Kingdom,"After visiting four times as an adult, I was so excited to take my daughter for the first time (just turned 5yrs).We expected it to be expensive   both the holiday itself and once we got there but still shocked at food drink prices. My biggest tip is to take drinks ans snacks. When reviewers say 'you cant take food', I think they mean the security frown upon big picnic bags and baskets. We spent about   15 on flavoured water and snacks before we left the UK and it saved us a fortune! One drink of pop in the park sets you back    4 and a small burger meal    12, so times that by four people and youre gona spend a lot of money..... We stayed at Santa Fe hotel which was great as the budget option. Id compare the size and standard of the room to a travelodge   its been modernised and is now Cars themed which my daughter loved! The only thing missing was a kettle (you can get one for free from reception!) And aircon   ceiling fan just wasnt enough in 30degrees. Breakfast is continental, simple and not much choice but we filled up on cereal croissants, cheese n ham so didnt need much for lunch in the park.My tip for lunch   small meal is Earl of Sandwich in the Village   yummy hot freshly prepared sandwiches   gutted I found it on the last afternoon! So much nicer than    12 for a soggy cold burger!Beware of queue jumpers and rude people barging in front of you. Some non brits have no concept of queues or turn taking. Try not to let it ruin your experience, they dont understand if you try to object. Ive read reviews of people not seeing many characters but we saw loads! Dont miss   the 'Dreams' light parade at night (11pm unfortunately) highlight of our trip even in torrential rain... we had a siesta in the afternoon to recharge our batteries then back in park 9pm for couple of rides before show.Enjoy the magic!!",Disneyland_Paris
170688691,5,2013-7,South Africa,"This is a must if you are going to Paris. This was my third visit to Disneyland Paris and it is definitely worth it! It doesn't matter what your age, you will enjoy it. The rides felt a lot shorter than the Orlando rides but I actually prefer it. They have the favorites like the Pirates of the Caribbean, Tower of Terror, Space Mountain etc. It is much smaller than Orlando and we found that it was very easy to do both parks in one day. Summer is an amazing time to visit. We were there in July 2013 and the queues were short   I think the longest waiting period was 15 minutes and we never had to use fast passes. You will find everything your heart desires that is Disney. It can be a very long day for little ones and depending on the age, you may want to do this in two days to take pressure off smaller children. I found the prices to be in line with the Disney prices in the USA. There were sales everywhere when we were there and we found so many bargains! You have to buy food within the park and the food portions are very big so think about sharing before you order separately. If you are going in Summer wear lots of sunscreen and hats! If you don't have, you have the widest range of stunning hats to buy at every corner of the parks. I found it to be busier over the Christmas period than over the July period in the summer holidays so think about going here when it is not so busy.The trains go right to the park and are so easy to navigate. We bought our tickets online and it worked a charm and we saved about 20 euros per ticket for booking in advance.I don't know anyone who has been to a Disney Park and not enjoyed it. It certainly brings out the child in me! I will be back at the first possible opportunity!",Disneyland_Paris
170652257,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"This was our second time and we thoroughly enjoyed it but as its half term it was extremely busy, ques for the rides were very long. They went down about 6pm or when the parades were on. The last parade at losing time was out of this world and worth waiting for and to top it off I got to meet jack sparrow!!",Disneyland_Paris
170563943,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,Lots of new things added since our previous trip 6 years ago. Quality still excellent. A great family trip. Give yourself time to get best value out of the park   you really need 3 days minimum to enjoy it all.,Disneyland_Paris
170560873,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Just returned from a fantastic time here with family and friends. For the time of year we were very surprised to find how quiet it was, however we soon realised that Disney have started to forget the customer and are turning more and more towards business opportunities. The prices were extortionate; it was cheaper to go to Florida last year for 14 nights than come here for 4. Additionally, the food outlets serve up poor quality food at 5 star prices. In numerous restaurants, the servers did not even understand their own menu! Many cast members, were unable to give us accurate information on location of attractions or times of shows. The teams looking after the rides, responsible for queuing and fast turn around were a joy to watch.....i.e. a set of clowns that would have difficulty organising a booze up in a brewery!",Disneyland_Paris
170500548,2,2013-6,United Kingdom,"I visited here for the day with my husband, mother and 2 children. It was a very hot day, and so understandably there were few characters walking around. The rides were fine, but none really stand out for me   certainly undeserving of the hype they receive   I much prefer those in the theme parks in England. I accept you pay a premium for food and drink in these types of places   but this was just too much. 6 euros for a sausage in a bun without sauce or onions is too much in my opinion. Drinks were also very expensive and warm. I think this is a very over hyped attraction.",Disneyland_Paris
170497127,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,"I took my three children here as the travel agent sourced a good deal for me, we originally went in a book a trip to Paris itself but this actually was a more affordable option and I felt more secure as I was travelling alone with the kids. They were obviously very excited and were not disappointed, the hotel package allowed us to enter two hours earlier than the general opening hours which allowed us to tick off a number of popular rides without the queues. The Sunday was an extremely busy day and with the heat we didn't get on a lot of rides we wanted too due to the queues.There was enough to keep us all happy, it felt safe and there was a lovely atmosphere. The light show at the castle was out of this world, we had to vacate it on the first night due to a thunder storm so thankfully we caught it the next day, it was magical. But be warned get your spot early and stay there it will be worth it.The main negative was obviously the price of food within the park....I was stretched towards the end of the holiday I must admit. Mc Donald's was a life saver...however I don't want to see another chip or Fanta orange for a while!We were lucky our hotel was close and included half board we slept well every night due to walking loads. I recommend you check out the map beforehand and have a plan it saves time and ensures you see everything. Good luck, enjoy but be prepared it is exhausting.",Disneyland_Paris
170492866,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,Totally brilliant felt like a child again when we saw Mickey on the parade. Queue times pretty good apart from buzz light year and thunder mountain. The light show is worth the long day and night.,Disneyland_Paris

170461087,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"I've been to Disneyland four times. The first time was for my seventh birthday as a one day trip, and it was the most magical place I'd ever been in my life. The latest was for my eighteenth birthday for four days, and it is still the most magical place I've ever been in my life. Even though a lot of the things that amaze you as a child   like the Disney characters   no longer appeal since you know they're not real, if you can suspend your disbelief you still have a fantastic time and the rides are still as great as I recall. Jack Sparrow got a whole crowd of total strangers to sing happy birthday to me. What other birthday celebration is that cool? I would definitely recommend visiting both Disney parks as there's a lot of interesting things (I'd personally suggest the Armageddon ride, the Moteurs Action stunt show and the Studio Tram Tour) in the smaller Disney Studios park. You can get around the smaller park in about four hours on a good day, but it took us about three days to do everything we wanted to do in the bigger, main park. Everyone should experience Disneyland at least once in their lives. It's expensive but so very worth it.",Disneyland_Paris
170427559,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,"We had a fantastic four days here the weather was brilliant.Im so glad we went all inclusive as drinks amd meals are extortionatly high eg;bottle of coke from train station 500meters outside the park   1.40 in the park   4 additionally all the shops in the park sold the same things very little variety from shop to shop and very expensive one Tshirt was   40.The average mael for two adults and one child would set you back   80 thats with out alchoholic drinks. Oh we did not book a transfer from airport to hotel and this cost us   56 so book in advanceAs I said we did have a fantastic time went on all the rides and the shows were great, a trip to Paris by train was very cheap",Disneyland_Paris
170418937,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"As the title says, expensive, but so worth it when I saw my children's faces when we walked through the gates. The parades were good fun, busy, but no problem seeing every float. The rides are great, lots of variety and for all ages, those with little ones, Buzz Lightyear is a must, for the older kids (mine was 7) Big Thunder Mountain!! The only issue I have is the massively inflated prices for basic things, like drinks or ice creams. 4 bottled drinks will set you back about 12 Euros, a sandwich and drinks for 4 in the Earl of Sandwich will set you back over 40 Euros. But apart from that we all loved it!!",Disneyland_Paris
170413373,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Liked : Good rides, particularly DiscoveryLand and Fantasyland (although not sure about Captain EO ride, i remember this from when i was small, can't imagine its aged well).Disliked : Expensiveand can hardly move in Main Street owing to sheer amount of people which can lead to some very frayed nerves. Also, queue jumping here tends to be not outwith the norm, so be on guard for people squeezing past you.",Disneyland_Paris
170410272,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"We visited Disney land Paris for a week long holiday, at the beginning of July this year.We stayed at the Dream Castle hotel a short bus ride away.I don't know where to start with this review, having read a lot of reviews before we went I was nervous as some of them were not very good at all, but having been for a week with the husband and two children under 5 I really don't know what they were talking about to be honest.The park was very very clean, no rubbish anywhere to be seen, it was extremely hot for the week we went and there isn't very many shadey areas to sit, to be honest that's one of my only moans!The parades were amazingly fantastic, and even brought tears to my eyes!! The 20th anniversary train parade runs a couple of times a day, and is lovely for any Mickey or mini mouse fan. The evening parade with all the princesses and Captain Hook is certainly worth waiting for and made our 4 year shake with sheer excitement. There was only one ride not working and it was soon up and running again.It was incredibly busy, so I would reccomend obtaining some fast past tickets, although these are not available on every ride.The toilets are clean, but to people that wrote bad reviews about dirty toilets etc, I think they went way the top here, there are thousands and thousands of people using these during the day, and considering this they were cleaned and managed very well .Food and drinks are very expensive inside the park, paying some 4 euros for a can of coke, is slightly obscene. But we did find a supermarche about 10 minutes away, so buy your children's water and juice etc from there, you are allowed to take your own snacks and drinks inside the park, so please ignore anyone that tells you otherwise. Bags are not usually searched but do have to go through an x ray machine.The food is all fast food style and everything does come with chips.The golden Nugget restaurant is middle priced, portions are large and there is some vegetables to be had here, we did find that because it was so hot we didn't really want a massive dinner.The fireworks of an evening are amazing, don't be fooled though the further away you are the better the experience and less chance of a dislocated neck!! Any child under 6 7 will need a buggy, or buggy board, it's too far to walk and too long standing up, you can hire them for 15 euros a day but it would worth while purchasing a cheapy one from Argos or something!The gift shops are great too, with lots of gifts, toys etc to suit different budgets.All in all, I wanted to write a review that would be actually helpful to future travellers and not just list the things that had upset or disappointed us, so I hope my review helps.We were all really sad to go home, I want to go back and now!It's a fantastic place for children who love anything Disney and the parents too! At the end if the day it's not a relaxing holiday by any stretch but you will all have a fab time and the memories will last a lifetime as the adverts says!!",Disneyland_Paris
170297024,5,2013-6,United Kingdom,"Everybody should soak up the Disneyland atmosphere at least once in their life : ) There will be queues and some people will get on your nerves, but the Disneyland expierience is second to none",Disneyland_Paris
170293941,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,I went here with my daughter(23) after a couple of days in Paris itself. We had travelled from central paris by the train which took about 45 minutes. You exit right at the park gates. We quickly did the bigger rides so that left us able to take our time in the other rides places we wanted to go. Waiting times were no longer than 1 2 hour and in most cases less time. Food is just a little expensive but we knew this would be the case so had taken some stuff with us.,Disneyland_Paris
170288799,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,"One of the things you must not do if you are planning a visit here is compare it to other Disney parks around the world. Having been to Disney World, it's easy to see why people would unfavourably compare Disneyland Paris to Disney World. But as a stand alone vacation destination, I think Disneyland Paris is superb.We spent four days at both parks, spending three of those in Disneyland Park itself. It's a really great park with some great rides and attractions. The parades are good and we enjoyed the end of day show, Dreams (even if we watched it in quite horrendous rain and soaking wet clothing).Naturally, prices inside the park are extortionate. But the security in the park doesn't seem quite as strict as other Disney parks. People were able to bring food and drink into the park. They also did vouchers for free drinks from certain locations at certain times, which was very well received. In busy park days, make sure you stake your spot for the parades and shows early. Typically, we would find a spot an hour before hand. This was vital   and a lot of people try to barge in as time gets closer.",Disneyland_Paris
170260088,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"I have got to start off by saying that I love Disneyland!What I don't love though is the price of food and drink when you get into the park, it really is extortionate and if I'm honest might even put me off going back in the future.We spent quite a lot of time in a que for rides, don't think that we stood in a q for less than an hour and if we wanted to go on the crusher ride we were going to have to wait on average 2 hours, far too long.My two boys are aged 7&8 and we took them to Disneyland for 5 days when they were aged 3&4 and they thought it was magical this time though they said they preferred parc asterix so....I think that everyone should visit Disney at some point in their lives but take plenty of money with you!,",Disneyland_Paris
170249667,3,2013-7,Indonesia,"For traveller who has visited Disney Hong Kong, Ocean Park Hong Kong, Universal Studio Singapore, Disneyland Paris looks old and small. But if haven't visit other parks, you must visit this park. To visit this park (and also other park) you need to have a healthy physic since you will walk and walk around the park. There is train commuter along the side of park but you need to to wait and queue. The best way to enjoy still walking around.",Disneyland_Paris
170221644,2,2013-5,United States,"We have been fortunate to travel to Disneyland in Los Angeles, Walt Disney World in Florida and we just returned from Disneyland Paris. We paid $ 75.00 online for the two park one day pass. My wife, who happens to huge Mickey fan was very excited when plan this trip. When took the train from Paris which was a very nice 40 minute train ride. When you first arrive and see the ticket entrance it is very impressive and  magical . Then when you get inside things change rapidly. For instance, the overall landscaping is very run down. There were even weeds growing in the Storybook ride homes. There are two rides that I was very disappointed in and they were Indian Jones and Space Mountain. They were both just your average outdoor roller coaster. No special effects or 3D effects. I would say the highlight had to be the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and the surrounding areas. If you have never been to another Disney theme park then this would be a great place to go. However, if you have been to the parks in the U.S. you might be disappointed.",Disneyland_Paris
170209077,5,2013-7,United States,Disneyland Paris is everything we expected and more. Yes its expensive and busy but the pleasure and memories it has given my children will last a lif.etime. The parade and fireworks are a must see and are well worth the wait but be sure to get seated early to get a decent view. The place is spotless and the staff are really friendly and polite. If you have young children it is must do adventure,Disneyland_Paris
170202326,1,2013-7,United Kingdom,"We have visited Disneyland on many occasions and have always had a thoroughly good time. But what always annoys me is the outrageous prices for the basics, eg soft drinks, ice lolly etc when really hot. A soft drink averages at approx   3.00 for a coke or bottled water, ice cream, cheapest we found was   3.50 for a twister. I appreciate the running costs of such an empire, but dont hold the visitors to ransom once in the park. These items cost a lot less than   1.00 outside of the park so why more than triple the price.If you want to save a little, purchase soft drinks in the small shop in the railway station just outside of the park, if you dont mind carrying them around with you. Keep the empty bottles and fill them with water at the fountains scattered around the parks.Food prices, well, again outrageous. For the more basic option, eg the greasy spoon, sausage sandwich, frys and a soft drink expect to pay approx   35  40 for 3 people, the meal equates to nothing more than you could purchase for less than a tenner at a local cafe in the UK.",Disneyland_Paris

170186118,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"I have never been to a Disney park and it went way above my expectations!! My boyfriend and I booked a last minute trip so we did the Disneyland Park in one day arriving at 10am and leaving at 11pm. Expect the obvious theme park food such as burgers, hotdogs, bbq, fries, ice cream, candy floss etc and expect to pay around    13.99 for a fast food meal containing burger, fries, brownie and drink. You can get 3 course meals at the restaurants in the park but be prepared to pay around    30 for a meal and make table reservations before lunch as they fill up fast. No rides were shut Tip: go on the popular roller coasters between 7pm and 11pm as waiting times are between 5 mins and 20 mins which is the lowest they are all day. I got thoroughly enchanted by the place, its immaculate and clean, staff were all friendly and chatty. Prices for souvenirs in Disney are as expected, balloons    7, minnie ears    11 it's not cheap but then again neither are the other theme parks I've visited. The parade is at 7pm and didn't disappoint Tip: go find your spot at 6pm as the parade route fills up fast. The firework display at 11pm is not to be missed but again people start finding spots at 9pm so if you do want to be in front of the castle prepare to be sat for 2 hours. Apparently it's a lot smaller than the Orlando park (I've never been) but you can walk around the Paris park quite easily, which makes it perfect for a two day break.",Disneyland_Paris

I rate Orlando Disney world at 8 out of ten, This I would rate a disappointing five out of ten, Its ok for one visit but you would not go back and once you have been to Orlando you just cant compare the parks. Orlando is twice as good. Really dissapointing issue withe cleanliness of the parks.",Disneyland_Paris

Big wooden galleon ship which we thought was a safe bet was also, you guessed it, closed... And apparently only opens on weekends... We had seen it open on the Friday and this was a Sunday... So just to recap: Thunder mountainSpace MountainStar ToursOrbitronSlinky DOgBuzz LIghtyear LaserBuzz, Parachute Drop All experienced technical failures during our visit and were closed to the parks' visitors.In terms of hospitality: The staff in the Agrabah cafe were noticeably unpleasant towards us, pointedly removing the cutlery settings from our children ( on half board plan, our two year old infant could have eaten with us anyway) and muttering about the Anglais under their breath when I explained that our children weren't going to eat as they were not hungry; heat and excitement having taken away their appetite. Across the parks, toilets were not a very Disney experience and our comments or complaints were met with a frustrating degree of indifference.After our disappointing last day we spoke to Client services but now have to speak to a separate team to request a refund...I now have a lack of faith in both the safety and the service at the Park and would not return. I hear that Orlando is much better...",Disneyland_Paris
170031420,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"I have already been to Disneyland in Florida and California so I knew what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised at the queue times as these were shorter than the other 2 parks, the longest wait being 35 minutes for Big Thunder Mountain and 25 minutes for Indiana Jones, both of which we thoroughly enjoyed. My children had never been to Disneyland before so were particularly looking forward to it. My daughter was a little disappointed though as firstly she was expecting to see more characters wandering around the park, we only saw Donald & Daisy Duck. Her second disappointment however needs a mention. She doesn't go on a lot of rides so the highlight of her visit was going to be the parade and she was really looking forward to this, as were we all. We found a good spot at about 6.30pm to view the parade and waited patiently for the 7.00pm start. At about 6.45 I felt two spots of rain, no more, on my arm. The sky was cloudy with patches of blue. At 2 minutes past seven there was an announcement in French that was followed by a chorus of whistles and boos from the crowd. We were unsure what was happening until a German guest told us that the parade had been cancelled, followed by the words  Bloody French! . A lot of people who did not speak French were still standing around waiting for the parade to start, then the announcement was repeated in several languages explaining that the reason was due to  inclement weather . As the crowd dispersed I saw many children in tears, asking their parents why the parade was not going ahead, struggling to understand, as it was clearly not raining. At 7.30pm, in bright sunshine, I felt another single spot of rain on my arm. Shame on you Disney! You're supposed to make children's dreams come true but all I saw was a lot of shattered dreams and upset children for no apparent reason. I also saw several parents trying to complain to staff and ask for an explanation but the staff were clearly unable or unwilling to give one.

When we left a camera(!!) on a ride it was taken immediately to lost property. Mid week we got on most rides fine, the place was clean.

Well worth it no matter how old you are.we saw people of all ages.some shops had like a mini sale on some things we made big savings on some of the things we bought so if your buying gifts to take home look at the sale stuff.only complaint we waited ages at the airport for the bus into Disney overall a great week and worth every penny or cent.it was great to see the big smiles on my daughters face.,Disneyland_Paris
169945115,4,2013-7,United States,"It's paradise but speaking as a Senior, pace yourselves!! The first day we did twelve hours straight with a very enthusiastic six year old   great but exhausting. Make the most of the Extra Magic Hours especially for rides like Buzz Lightyear's Laser Blast, Big Thunder mountain etc. BE WARNED   none of the coffee outlets open till 10 even when the Magic Hours allow you to be there from 8 and it's really hard to find a drink unless you go back to Main Street USA so fill up those water bottles   and don't be fooled by those websites that say there are plenty of water fountains; there are some but they are scattered and few and far between. The riverboat is a good rest for weary feet and my granddaughter adored Alice's Curious Labyrinth. Don't miss the Disneyland Park parade at 19.00   far better than the disappointing Cars and Stars in Walt Disney studios. And the firework and laser show at park closing time is spectacular. we kept our six year old up to see it and she loved every second",Disneyland_Paris
169926196,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"3 brilliant days at Disney again but don't count on the weather staying good to see a parade. We left seeing the parade to our last day and it was cancelled due to inclement weather. Not a drop of rain fell and no wind to talk of but it had clouded over and isolated thunder storms were forecast so that was that. For about an hour all the outside rides (Dumbo, Carousel, etc) were closed down and we set sail on the paddlestaemers only to return to port after less than 5 minutes and told the ride was closed due to the weather conditions. The storm never arrived and rides were reopened, but the parade is never rescheduled. But that's enough grumbling, it is Disney and was as usual everything we hoped for. If you want to ride Crush's Coaster get into the studios before 10 and join the line you see to your right. That way you may get away with a 30 minute wait which is how long it took my family both days. At all other times I saw after 10:10 the estimated time was 70 minutes plus. It is apparently worth doing (I don't do rollercoasters but the rest of the family does). Be aware some of the restuarants look very closed (about one in each park area), Pizza Planet is one of these so don't promise it to little ones in advance!It's not cheap but we felt it was worth every penny. Even the food was good quality and varied, just a bit on the pricey side.",Disneyland_Paris

169853699,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"We visited here for my 30th Birthday and I loved every minute. It really is the happiest place on earth. We had 2 full days and an afternoon here and if I'm honest that was enough to do both parks comfortably. My only gripe I guess with myself was that we didn't really plan ahead so meals, shows parades etc. were a bit hap hazard. If you know when your going and what you want to see phone ahead and reserve restaurants (by the time you get to the resort it'll be too late!)I recommend Caf   Mickey for a decent meal middle of the road prices and the chance to meet several characters without queuing! We had the Disney dining plan which I loved but again with this plan ahead so you know where you can use them as its a bit limited in the studios park. You can use your meal vouchers in pricier restaurants and the dinner show and pay a little extra if you're on a lower priced plan.",Disneyland_Paris
169764918,3,2013-7,Australia,Plede read this review in the context of someone who has been to most of the Disney parks! Paris great and very beautiful but it lacks some of the special detail that you really notice at other Disney parks like their brilliant queue management systems and long queue distraction systems. On the day we went at least 2 major rides were closed for several hours due to technical issues. I also found this park much more pitched at the under 10's. having said all this I think that if you have never had a Disneyland experience then it is a must do!,Disneyland_Paris

169629461,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Six of us went there; my wife and I, our son and his girlfriend (both 21) and our daughter and her boyfriend (both mid 20s) and we stayed in the Newport Bay Club hotel which backed onto a large artificial lake. The parks were about 10 minutes walk from the hotel, and it was generally quiet all the time.The hotel room was not in A1 shape; various damage was evident, probably due to age, but we didn't plan to spend much time in the room anyway. Everything worked, there is a free safe and the water temperature stays constant. A couple of times, the loo roll wasn't replaced, so we had to borrow and lend from each other to cope, to avoid trips to the concierge.The breakfast at our hotel was mainly continental but there was a cooked breakfast on offer for additional money. We didn't take advantage of it, and made up our lunch using rolls and cold meats to save spending money in the parks. We were aware that things would not be cheap, and doing this DIY lunch saved us all more than 300 Euros.The two parks are incredible. There is the Disney Studio park, which features things from the movies. Characters and rides based on such movies as Toy Story, Small Soldiers, etc., are scattered around, and there is a variety of thrill levels from tame to  red  (e.g. Rock'n'Roller Coaster and Tower of Terror).Then there is the Theme park, which is split into different  lands ; FantasyLand, DiscoveryLand, AdventureLand, FrontierLand and these are served by Main Street to the entrance. There are many rides and features within this place, and if you like  red  rides (like we do) you will enjoy Space Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.Obviously, in both parks, there are plenty of things for younger guests to do, and facilities of all types are in abundance. Everything seems to be well thought out, and I was generally very impressed with the operation of the place at all levels. I left my camera and some cash and my hotel room access card on one of the rides (in a small bag) and by the time I returned to the ride (Buzz Lightyear's Laser Blast   I loved it) the bag had already been transferred to Lost and Found in Main Street. In truth, I expected to be reunited with it since most people who attend the place would be there for fun and not opportunistic theft purposes. But I was impressed by the prompt handling of the issue.The toilets were in the main clean. Only once, in the Videopolis, late one night, did I find a cubicle that spoiled it for all, but staff were dealing with it at the time.You can't have Disney without the pomp, and we saw the evening fireworks show twice and various parades of characters a couple of times as well. None of them went on for more than 30 minutes, which is perfect.The restaurants in the parks seemed average and we didn't use them. Instead, we visited Planet Hollywood, the Rainforest Cafe and Cafe Mickey. Cafe Mickey was excellent, with several Disney characters visiting our table and posing for photos with us. The food was good, and we found this restaurant was the most fun. The Rainforest Cafe was good as well, with an elephant trumpeting at the end of our table adding to the surrealism. We found Planet Hollywood less good in terms of the food (my wife likes a salad and she thought hers was a little bit lacklustre and rushed in its construction). However, the service there was very good.We also attended Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, which included dinner consisting of a few courses of cowboy and barbecue type foods served during the show. It warns people with allergies to be aware of the fact that live animals perform, but we had no problems with it despite slight asthma in our group. I felt that the service throughout this was a bit perfunctory, and a couple of times the food was plopped onto our plates in the style of a prison canteen, but we just got on with it and enjoyed the show.We were blessed with weather (not really something Disney can control, even with Mickey's magic), and the parks look fabulous in the sunshine. There is a swimming pool at the hotel we stayed in, and it was very pleasant to use it in the afternoons to stay cool. Other facilities, including sauna, steam room and health room were available.Would we go again? Definitely. I'm hoping to return at least once, perhaps when some grandchildren arrive...",Disneyland_Paris
169619838,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"We travelled as a three generation family and had lovely weather, which was a bonus. However, the inability of park staff to enforce their own smoking ban is a severe drawback. Having to walk through groups standing smoking on pathways and in entrances to toilet facilities is not pleasant. In their defence, we did not see any of the areas that were supposed to be the specially designated areas for smokers. The solution seems to be simple, anyone smoking in an inappropriate place should be ejected from the park and their ticket cancelled. It would not take too long for the message to get through. In general though, the queues were well controlled with good communication, but nevertheless this park did not have the feel of a  Magical Kingdom  that Disney claims for it.",Disneyland_Paris
169523231,1,2013-7,Qatar,"This was our 3rd visit to the park as our son is now 3 and would have enjoyed the magic of Disney, especially in its 20th year anniversary. We paid around   700 for a 4 day pass for 5 of us and were desperately disappointed that despite visiting some of these rides 3 times, they remained out of service.It was a very enoyable experience for our 3 year old but our teen daughters were left with no choice but to stand in the overextended queues for second rate rides as the primary attractions were not running.We felt cheated and when we broached the subject with the park management office we were dismissed out of hand and quite rudely to boot.Wont be coming back in a hurry as attitudes were poor.....Florida holds far more appeal and much better value for money.",Disneyland_Paris

169356007,4,2012-12,United Kingdom,"We were staying in Paris City Centre near eiffel to 10 minute walk from Hotel to Tower. We were staying for a few Days so we decided to go to Disneyland One day had no clue were it was or how to get their, so was a experience, and a Challenge to get their. I am determined and was adamant I am going their no matter what. We went to the Under ground Ticket Office so that was an experience since England is the Next closest Country you would think they could speak good English. I spoke Basic French in School, so I thought I could speak French or so I thought..lol They spoke little English and was hard to ask directions but we booked a ticket some where but we got on the metroTrain link underground we got of one stop walk to another up walking floors to get to the platform we had to wait for another one as it was not one way to Disneyland Paris as It wasn't even in Paris we discovered.lol We got of our last stop on the Metro Link was told to walk to a Station on Ground level because the Metro Link wouldn't go all the way, so we walked for twenty minutes but felt longer as we didn't know which direction everyone said it wasn't far but when you don't know what direction your walking to it can be far..lol We tried asking directions but most could not speak English, when we got to a bus depoe asked at the Ticket Office but got no Joy was told it was easy they weren't very helpful so we decided to ask a bus driver the bus driver dropped us of when we asked for directons he gave us a lift to the next stop he must of thought it was easier to explain he didn't charge us. He dropped us of in a middle of City Blocks with buildings all around us tall high buildings their was a building which to me was a Library was temted to ask in their but thought was already getting a headache of asking.lol I was trying my best to Speak French to passes byers as I hadn't been to school for over 10years thought I did and remembered a lot. Was asking them cesque cai say Le train Mickey Mouse.lol so was speaking to them but one man helped point us in the right direction, but their was no train signs on the station as we got their a few times but didn't realise as their was no sign because we were at the side of a building which wasn't he same as the rest not the front. we were in the Middle of a Town Centre he dropped us of at a T Junction the side of the Sation was in front but no signs.lolSo the building looked somethink like a Library or Museum was in fact theTrain Station, when we walked around to the front but it was like Canada where I've ben before where it was City Blocks and roads leading to high buildings not the Norm like in Liverpool Or Machester. So we got on and it was over an hour into Disneyland and goes right into the Park you could say right in the front door. We finally got their after over two hour Journey, again when we tried asking things to Staff in Disneyland they where limited English speakers, to me if I was in a Family I would be quite scared, but as I made it this far got to the point didn't care I was in Disneyland which isn't in Paris its in Marne La Vallee France.lol Which is where in France.??lol or Timbook Too!!So if you want to go to Disneyland be warned go their and stay, don't try go Paris from here as its quite a Journey and luck be it we made it but I am am quite determined and kept asking, if your layed back not the strong type you may end up in Italy..Are experience their it as 60 euros but that was for both parks as I thought might not make it next time we come so paid for both but their wasn't enough time to get round as I left at about 830am in morning and arrived in Park at 12pmthe Cues to pay where no way as big as Alton Towers but the guy in front of us was Slow probably debating the Price but he was Foreign so didn't know what he was saying. Its as dear as Alton Towers full price, and The cues where as big if not bigger than Alton Towers, it was busier like I say if you want to get round just stay at Disneyland and do it over a few days.As the day got later I thought on we were lucky to get their and had no clue how we got here and how to get back, apart from the train was right at the front door where we got of in Disneyland, but then I had a thought if that wasn't bad enough what time was the last train, say no more.lolWe enjoyed it the Gifts were very Dear like Alton Towers but a tenor more, yes a tenor more very dear we bought a Miney Mouse on the Eifel Tower which was somethink like   25 pounds if I am correct might be more nut lookd around whilst I was their and Cups kids toys where not cheap or reasonable either.The journey on the way home was a bit easier but still asking for directions luck be it spoke to a well spoken French man who spoke good English whilst we got on the Metro after the train from Disneyland he was well educated as I asked a lot of questions he was quiet honest and sincere, so we was lucky again. We ran out of money on Metro Card because tht gives you a crdit to and from the Satation you had to use it through Doors as a Key card to get out of the Metro Station or in or just to next Platform, we got locked in as it ran out but their was no way of climbing as their where high I might of done it with a squeeze it was 8pm at night when we got back to the station we first paid for a return ticket so how we ran out I dont know, but me Girlfriend wouldn't climb so probably couldn't climb as it was a squeese so we had go back and we seen the Metro Police as we had to ask them how we got out of being arrested I don't know.lol if that's not putting your neck on the line I don't know what is, but their was no other way no ticket office open or anythink just machines which were in French. They let us out as we would of been trapped in their, like that film with Tom Hanks but in The Airport.lol They watched to made sure we put money back on Card so wehad to come back to put it in machine where they were, so it was a Morale ground but we already paid?? Bit of s Joke as I paid for a Return as we were 10 minutes from the Hotel which was the station we paid the return from.lol I relised this as we walked free, freedom.lol But we were save and Home so it wasn't long before I forgot about the extra fair That night was our last night so we went to a restaurant and had Snails laughed about it but it was an adventure put it that way. But all in all would go their again but will stay their next time.lol",Disneyland_Paris

In summer the park is not as busy as during other school vacations.Like other theme parks, Disneyland Paris also suffers from poor food choice. Each land in the park has it's theme related menu, however the quality is not as high standard as the park itself. After long walks and inevitable cues, one would like to eat something substantial besides pasta, chips or chicken. No fruit to be found except for the glazed apples.",Disneyland_Paris

The ten years showed, the staff are not as helpful as Florida or indeed as they were, there were one or two who really had the nice day disney attitude. Five of the big rides were out of service for unspecified technical faults with people being allowed to cue for long periods before being told. The cues for rides we experienced were never in line with the indicated times, the worst said 30 minutes and actually took 1hour and 10 minutes.

169299716,3,2013-7,Netherlands,"I've been to Disneyland world in Anaheim, Orlando and Paris. To my observation, in Paris, the attractions are the same as in Anaheim. We really enjoyed the rides, felt young again. However, when it came to food I was very disappointed. First of all, France is known for its good food, however, when you step into the park, it seems like you're in a fast food jungle. Its fries with hamburger, sausage, chicken wings, whatever other cheap  meats  you can think of. It felt like a Monty Python sketch where they had replaced the Spam with Fries. Anyway, I had a salad instead, that I seriously would not even feed a rabbit. The dressing was pure vinegar, not a nice vinaigrette. Even Mac Donald's has better quality than the food here. As for the price of the food, I could have had 4 happy meals for the price of 1  lunch  sold here.My suggestion to the owners: get rid of the fries and introduce the nice baguettes sold in down town Paris.Another disappointment: the stake place in Adventure land only opens in the evening. There I was standing in front of a closed door with my mouth watering. I would have paid top dollar for a decent meal. What a shame.We did enjoy the ice cream at the Ben and Jerry's outlet on Main Street. Great quality ice cream, waffles and pancakes served on too small paper plates with plastic forks and spoons.By the way, the check at the entrance is not that strict and there is a picnic area outside the park where you can eat your own stuff. However, on a hot day, how could you possibly keep your food edible?By the way, at the TGV train station outside the park, you can buy great tasting muffins and cakes at a small shop. However, take care, the cashier almost robbed me of my change, so keep your eye on those Euros.Anyway, its DETOX time for me now.",Disneyland_Paris
169285232,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,"We just returned from 4 days staying at the Santa Fe Hotel in Disneyland and had a great time. The staff were all very friendly both at the hotel and in the park. Our favourite rides were the Tower of Terror, Space Mountain,Thunder Mesa, and Indiana Jones for sheer scream your head off fun. The Haunted Manor was also really good and looked great at twilight. My daughter and I really enjoyed the sweetness of A Small World and the Mad Hatters Teacups was a good laugh. Small and big kids will love the Buzz Lightyear ride too. The parade at 7 and the Disney Dreams light show at 11 are a must see but be prepared to feel a bit emotional. My only gripe is that a lot of the adrenaline rides appear to have technical difficulties and information is not always relayed in English, we spent 20 minutes at the broken down Aerosmith rollercoaster before we were told to leave. The 2 hours extra time in the morning for residents of the Disneypark was a bit pointless as the only rides open were in Futureland and even then a couple were shut due to technical difficulties. Water and juice are very overpriced at around    3.50 for a small bottle and the water from the water fountains was warm and gave us dodgy tummies. The food is also quite expensive so I would highly recommend getting a half board pass. The budget pasta and pizza joints were cheap enough but had a very limited menu and the frozen pizza was a bit undercooked. On the other hand the Silver Spur Saloon in Frontierland was amazing, just book a table as it gets pretty busy, the food was excellent and the staff were pretty cool. It was very hot when we went and a fan would have been a welcome buy but Disney has missed a trick by not selling them. The Disney shops are all much of a muchness, we found the Frontierland ones had the best range. Keep your receipts as if you want to return or exchange anything they will not do it without one as I found to my cost. All in all it was a fun experience and I would definitely go again, there were rides that suited both my teenage son and daughter but take plenty of money, it is extortionate.",Disneyland_Paris

On the Hotel, we found that the catering was quite poor, the restraunt opened late despite the reservation system (much abused by the staff as a mask to avoid serving half board walk in trade) and the room staff were instructed to only provide one bar of soap, and one toilet roll in a four person room. Cost cutting? The menu in the hotel and the poor quality of the breakfast and dinner, very factory made says so!In park, catering was very poor. we ate in the studio one, servers were idle in one queue while others were rushed off ther feet in others.

There were no characters walking around the park and it does not have that magical Disney feel. The staff were unhelpful, unfriendly and uninterested. There was no interaction with the children and it seems they were just there for the money. They were quiet often rude or would just choose to ignore you.We were also disappointed with the number of rides shows that were either not working or cancelled. To name a few, indian jones ride closed, Pirates of the caribbean ride closed, thunder mountain closed, Rock'n'roller Coaster closed, car parade was cancelled as was the stun show.Also, to buy anything in the park was expensive, a bottle of water was 3.09 euro so i would advise taking your own food and water.

We had a wonderful time, we didn't do to many rides but tbh we are just happy seeing the shows and taking in the atmosphere. We found all staff polite and helpful. We were traveling with our grandad who is in a wheelchair( but can walk a bit with help) and the cast members couldn't do enough to help us. In blue Lagoon restaurant we wanted to sit by the water and the staff insisted on helping Grandad down the steps. Winnie the pooh came down from his post so he could meet grandad. Outside peter pans flight, my sister and mum was waiting to meet peter pan and a cast member actually came over to them and asked if they was waiting to meet him and told them when he was coming out, unfortunalty we had a reservation at cafe mickey for that time so the women went to see if peter could come out earlier, he couldn't but she gave them a unlimited fastpass for the day instead. We saw lots of characters around the park and really enjoyed the little shows like the pirate show that we didn't even know was on untill we saw it outside blue lagoon. There does seem to be more characters in Walt disney studios as there is more space and doens't seem to be as busy.It rained while magic on parade was on but tbh it was a nice as it cooled us down a bit and wasn't raining too hard. Dreams was amazing too, they really go all out on it. It was an amazing trip and I think people should just take there time, don't expect to get everything done, just relax and enjoy it.

168957023,3,2013-7,United States,"I don't know how much more I can really add to what's already been reported so I'll just reiterate some things. If you are staying on a Disney property, get up early, get there early and take advantage of the Extra Magic Hours. In the span of an HOUR, we went on Peter Pan's Flight (which always has a long queue and is too dark inside), Teacups, Carousel, Dumbo Elephants, Buzz Lightyear and Space Mountain! Also, use the baby swap at the end of each ride. It will allow one parent to stay back with a younger child and then ride (with a  1 so my older daughter would get to go on rides twice in a row). This is under advertised but great! The staff we found to be generally either super nice or super miserable. It's a bit of a let down compared to the Disney brand and the usual customer service. One morning we arrived and Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, AND Indiana Jones were closed down! Really? That's the entire side of the park! The only thing we were able to go on was the Haunted House on that side. Which, I noted that the ghost reflection image at the end was still not working   5 years later (we also came over for the 15th Anniversary celebration). How is this possible? Where is our money going? Bottom line is you better not plan to go for just one day or you may be really disappointed. We were able to spread our trip out for 3 days, though not all full days. Queuing was unbelievable at times. Trying to meet a character was unbearable as you are dealing with many rude Europeans who will literally push your children out of the way. I nearly got into a scrap with a lady who knocked my 4 year old over to put her child close to Gepetto! The princess pavilion concept was much better but as parents you have to queue to get a ticket, then you come back later (so you have to plan your day to the exact moment, which I hate)... and then after waiting you have no idea which princess you will be seeing! The parade was nice but there were some silly things like an usher who was literally  the foot police  ensuring that your feet stay on the curb and don't touch the street. It was absurd. Especially as he was right in front of us blocking our view! The fireworks at the end are worth sticking around for (that's where our money is going). We decided that this was our last trip to Disney Paris as we'd rather go to Orlando and deal with people who seem generally pleased to have a job, less pushy crowds and more ground to cover. Tip: If you are going multiple days and you rent a stroller (15 euro!), save your name card. When you come in the next day, there are often strollers left by people swapping to another park at the exit.",Disneyland_Paris
168953766,1,2013-7,Australia,"Going at peak season is probably just asking for trouble. And that's what we did. Hauling four kids around Disneyland in peak season is worse than Survivor. Manners in this part of the world are in very short supply, there are tonnes of people, and you can expect to be frequently jostled, pushed and have your three year old ripped from your arm by some impatient European teenager wanting to get one metre ahead of you on the escalator.The queues were unbelievable    50 90 minutes, for rides that last only minutes.We watched a couple of movies    Captain Eo and the Armaggedon one    but be warned you have to sit through a 10 minute video which is basically a long advertisement (in the case of Captain Eo it was for Kodak). Really? haven't we paid enough to get in    do we need to be forced to watch advertising? I turned around during these to see if anyone was watching and absolutely no one was! But you have to stand during these ads, and it is mega infuriating.The icing on the cake was at the Videopolis arcade games    my children had been queuing at the air hockey table for a game and when it was finally their turn, two adults leapt from their game and quickly seized the air hockey game so that my children couldn't have a turn. When my husband pointed out that our kids had been waiting, the woman haughtily replied that they were only playing that game while waiting for the air hockey to finish. They then proceeded to have game after game (continually inserting coins so that the kids couldn't have a go) and when i politely asked them how much longer they were going to be the woman simply shrugged and said 'i don't know, i don't know). No staff to help in any of these areas    the one from the eatery told me to go find a shop to get this woman off and allow my kids to have a game. A shop? which one? He just shrugged and i gave up. Charming. Bathroom facilities are very dirty but the baby rooms seem to be ok (there aren't many). But be warned, you aren't allowed to take a pram into the baby changing facilities (!!) so if you are going in by yourself with more than one small child, be prepared. Actually just don't. Go with two people because no matter how much pleading you undertake, you won't be allowed to take that pram in. Cos the staff are young students, with no influence and no ability to be flexible when conditions call for it. They are only there for a few months at a time, and they just do what they are told.The staff are taught to have what staffer described to me as 'American manners'. That is, no matter how rude people are to you, you just smile and say 'have a nice day'. And people are rude to them, unbelievably so. I've never heard people be as rude and demanding as i did at Disneyland. All around horrible. The attractions on the Gold Coast in Australia are much better, and the atmosphere is a lot less combative.",Disneyland_Paris
168951261,3,2013-7,Switzerland,"This park is pretty comparable to the Anaheim and Orlando versions, but I do agree with other reviewers that it could use a little freshen up. The Disney feel is definitely there. We arrived early to take advantage of  Magic hours  since we were staying at one of the Disney hotels. I was disappointed to find that both the Frontier and Adventure land were closed until the normal park hours. Also, many of the rides in the areas we did have access to were closed until normal park hours, which I found disappointing as well. Most of the rides are similar to the US versions. We did see the Indiana Jones ride and were excited about it since we loved the Anaheim version. We ended up being disappointed when we realized it was a roller coaster and not the same ride. Overall, we had a good time, but much like the other park, this park comes slightly short of being as good and fun as the US parks. But, if you are in Europe and want the Disney experience, then this park is pretty fun.",Disneyland_Paris
168902603,2,2013-7,United Kingdom,"i have visited disney many, many, many times.... and it seems like every time i go there, one of the big rides break down..... one out the many stories i have: last year when i visited, i looked for indiana jones. we walked around for ages trying to find it with no success. returned to the uk to find out that it had been taken offsite for repair (?????)this year, we looked for the ride, and found it !! we saw a 50 minute wait time, and decided we have to go on it. 45 minutes in the queue and we within the next three cars to go on. the cars go round a couple of times, and one stops dead at the top eof the track, the other returned to the start position and let more people on. they were just locked in, and they were told to get out again, given fast passes to come back again. not one member of staff came to the queue full of people (probably over 150 people at this stage) to tell them what was happening... now over an hour in a queue that didnt move.after another 10 minutes or so, we heard some people shouting from the other car that stopped on the tracks, a member of staff walked very slowly, laughing back at her colleagues, over to the broken down car, and released the safety rails and let the people down the fire escape. they were all given fast passes to come back later. (if it works)still noone told anyone in the queues what happened.after another 20 minutes or so, a member of staff approached the people at the beginning of the queue and quietly explained to them only that the ride had broken down and they were awaitng technical staff to come over.people from further back in the queue came through to the front to leave the queue, and we followed. we had only limited time there and didnt want to waste any more time in the queue that wasnt going to get us on a ride after all.we ended up doing one ride (rock n roller coaster with a 20 minute wait that is well worth it) in two days.",Disneyland_Paris
168890862,1,2013-7,Netherlands,"Disneyland Paris looks like a Disneypark   but make no mistake, it itsn't. For a start, most of the rides on our visit was closed   or closed down while we were waiting (for over an hour on several rides). The park looks tired, in dire need of fresh paint and TLC. The staff is not what you'd expect from an expensive, Disney branded park. Most of them lacking language skills or just being rude. In the best case, totally uninterested in your presence. We stayed at the New York hotel, and found the room to be small, with cigarette marks on the furniture, staind carpet and dirty wall paper. Check in staff didn't speak English.. and WiFi is extra. Not what I expect from a 'deluxe hotel'.Avoid the restaurant Parkside. The staff was so uninterested in our business that we (2 adults, 2 children) left without ordering (which nobody noticed)If you can afford it, go to Florida or California. And if you are Disney: Change the management or close the park. I'm sorry to sound so negative, but the highlight of our 2 day visit was McDonalds and the nearby village.",Disneyland_Paris
168888608,1,2013-7,France,"I visited disney on 24 July 2012 as a birthday treat for my 3 year old.The day started ok, and after a lengthy queue she was able to have some 1:1 time with Mickey, following which she was really keen to see some more of her Disney 'friends'. She was placated by the discussion that she would see them all at the parade later. The day progressed relatively successfully, if in a somewhat wallet draining manner (   10 for 3 bottles of drink, the same for 3 ice creams, and    33 for lunch for 3... On a hot day, that's    70 in food and drinks alone)At 630, we went to find a space for the parade which was to start at 7... So my daughter would have a good view of the parade... We barely managed to get a space as it was already heavy populated even at that time..Nearing 7, it was heavily overcast, but we all waited on for the parade... It did not, at any point rain...At 7pm exactly, when the parade was due to start, and expectation was built in the crowd, an announcement was made that said the parade was cancelled due to inclement weather.. I thought it was a joke t first, until the crowd started jeering and then started getting up and walking off...Surely enough.. It was all cancelled.. The staff started collecting the barriers etc and that was that.. At no point did it rain, and by 720 the cloud had largely broken up and I have a photo of the blue sky that was showing by this point.This was massively upsetting for my daughter and was to my mind an appalling piece of event management and a massive misjudgement given that it didn't rain and was blown over 15 minutes later! Somebody should be fired as a result of it and I'm sure my complaint will be lost in a sea of others as MANY people were equally disappointed by this ridiculous management call, which is made much worse by the fact that they did not notify the gathered crowd, many whom had been waiting 30 60 minutes, until the event was actually due to start... The weather was no better worse at 7pm than it was at 645, and the fact that they had waited until 7 to cancel it added insult to injury. If this is an typical example of Disney parks, it may well be the last one I ever take my family too!",Disneyland_Paris
168887207,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"We were lucky enough to be able to be in Euro Disney for the 15th anniversary as well as this 20th and thought we would comment on how they compare. In our opinion it was quite sad to see how the recession had hit even here. The entrance to Main Street was magnificent with tinkerbell flying and 20 all in gold lights. However, unlike the the 15th that's where the reminders of the anniversary stopped really. the celebration train wasnt around as much as last time nor were the characters which now tend to be inside special buildings (dont know if this is due to summer weather). the rides were all experiencing technical faults on one day and NON of the main attraction rides were operational. It was absolutely devestating for the kids not to mention exhausting going round the parks trying to find a ride we could go on! the staff were mainly polite but due to limited english were unable to explain what was happening and some were extremely rude. we went into the main city hall customer service to find out more info and were told that more often than not it is due to the guests overcrowding the rides which them become unsafe   we did see evidence of this later on when silly people were climbing on the scenery in Pirates ride. as well as attempting to stand on big thunder mountain this then shuts the rides down due to health and safety. We reminded the lady that this wasnt simply a theme park to lots of guests but a dream come true and staff should acknowledge that people have spent an incredible amount of money to get there (we saved 3 years) she did have the decency to agree and apologise for her rudeness. She also gave us several tickets to enable us to enter the rides at the exit to save queueing as we had spent all day doing just that   So come on guests please please queue safely so everyone can enjoy the rides. We did think however this was also attributed to far less staff at the rides than we've seen before and we did see a pattern forming that when the rides were at a peak they would simply close for 2 hours and then re open when the crowds calmed down. This being said the light show was out of this world and I defy anyone not to shed a tear   it was awesome   we stayed up twice to watch it (11pm start was pushing it every night for our 4 year old) but its was so worth it the 2 times we saw it   blown away   excellent   so in a nutshell Christmas period is still our most favourite time as it is so magical as summer seems to be a tad manic but we still love disney   bring on Florida!",Disneyland_Paris

Huge lines, bad organization, waiting 45 minutes in line for lousy lunch, characters hiding away, 1 2 hour waiting time for any atraction, 45 minutes transfer from parking, 2 hour wait to get on the train.. Will not go there again, the magic is gone completely. Just to give perspective: we wanted to go for 3 days, ended up leaving after 6 hours completely exhausted and without any fun   our children voted   no more ever. There are much nicer places around Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

168811706,1,2013-6,South Africa,"The park was extremely over crowded. The queues for the rides were running at 50 minutes!!! Do not go in June or July. On one of our days, we only managed to do four rides (and that was with the fast pass!) On the first day, four of the major rides were out of commission. On the next three days two of the major rids were out of commission. The fast pass was of little use as this could only be issued for two hours form the time you requested it, and you could only have one at a time. All fast passes had run out by two o'clock. The park was actually looking in bad repair all round and quite a few of the features were not functioning. The ghost images in the mirrors of the haunted house were not working (perhaps these have still not been repaired). The geyser water feature in the Wild West was not working (I am sure this has not been repaired). The show in the saloon of the Wild West was not on. Is this how Euro Disney always functions? It was impossible to get an invitation to meet and greet the princesses, as the queue was an hour long, and they only gave out a limited amount of tickets per day. The queues to meet the other Disney characters were at least half an hour long. The merchandise was overpriced (70 Euros for a princess dress!) The rides are dated and cheesy. I really was expecting a lot more. The fireworks display was wonderful and the Princess lunch was awesome, but expensive, and Mickey Cafe was also great, but expensive. Overall though, we really did not enjoy our experience at Euro Disney. I would rather go to Lego Land!",Disneyland_Paris
168781436,2,2013-7,United States,"We love Disney. For one day, we buy into the dream, the gimmicks, the fun. We've been to both Disney parks in the US and others internationally. This summer, we got to add Disney Paris to the list. We had high expectations based on our other experiences. Ultimately, we had a lovely day, so I can't be too hard on Disney Paris. We loved the castle!! BUT, there were two main problems that we had that really could be fixed. First, the majority of rides were either down all day or not functioning for large parts of the day. Fast pass was useless. We spent a lot of time walking from ride to ride only to find they were closed. Or, worse yet, we'd be standing in long queues for a ride and it would shut down. Second, the staff need to smile, make eye contact, and otherwise appear to like their job. I mean, really, it's Disney!! Many of the ride food staff just looked irritated and distracted. For this reason, I am glad Disney Paris was not our first Disney experience, or we'd be totally turned off. The one exception, was a most enjoyable young man working at the Tower of Terror. The ride had technical difficulty (see above problem) while we were in line and he made an effort to make it fun for everyone. At the end of the day, we approached customer service and reported our experience to them. To their credit, they offered us free tickets to return on another day. The tickets, however, could only be used at Disney Paris which was not an option for us. So, they gave my daughter a small stuffed animal instead. I hope that they listen to feedback and at least try to make some improvements. Smiles are free!",Disneyland_Paris

Stayed outside the park in the Sejours Affaires and got the shuttle bus in every day to the Disney Village.Couple of things if you're going during the summer like we did. It is HOT. There are queues everywhere so plan to carry a water spray to cool down loved ones( this worked a treat in the 50 minute queue for the 3 minute Dumbo Ride! :) ah, I say that in jest! The trip was truly magical, most especially because of the nighttime shows   aka 'Disney Dreams'   which come on just as the park is closing. We brought DD home to sleep around 5pm, woke her around 8pm and brought her in to see it two nights. Her face, I will never forget! The queues for the princesses I will happily block from my memory though! The tickets are handed out at various allotted times during the day but while we were there, there was a queue to get into the queue, to get a ticket, to get into a queue in the Pavillion. It was bonkers. We did it three times and DD even with all that, didn't get to meet her favourite princess because it is a 'surprise' princess!! Rant over!

168764080,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"I went to Disneyland Paris (Euro Disney back then) on its opening year and I just visited again and it was such a disappointment... Although the rides are still great, just as great as I remember them, and the park's cleanliness is top notch, the whole experience is let down by sub par food, with the same horrible, extremely expensive food delivered to every  restaurant  in the park, making the thematic vibe of each meaningless, as well as the fact that they will charge you dearly for every single thing in the place. With such a hefty price tag on the park tickets and hotels, I would expect them to have some free wi fi areas, but not even the lobby of the hotels inside the park have this and the rooms have also paid ethernet.I didn't find the queueing to be too over the top, we queued longer than 30 minutes only in a couple of rides, and one ride  broke down  on us while waiting (Thunder Mountain) which was really upsetting, but we did get fast track tickets for us to return later to it when it was working.The amount of characters around the park was another disappointment. There just isn't enough., We only saw 3 of them and they immediately got  mobbed  for pictures. The parade we saw was exactly the same both days and was rather lame, compared to the magnificient cars I witnessed in the park 20 years ago. It was just a little train with some characters in it that didn't make any sense. I wish I had seen the Electrical Night Parade again.On the other hand, the lights, fireworks and vision show they have to close the park every night this year is rather astounding and well worth watching more than once.If you don't go with kids, it's perfect to get to the park after 5PM or something like that, as most of the younger population leaves the premises and you can queue less in most popular rides like Space Mountain 2.in all, a great park let down by an overly greedy attitude.

Also staying in a Disney hotel we got into the park earlier than the general public arriving for the day. Dropped a point for the cost of bottled water which as the weather was in the high 20's we drank a lot. Cost us a fortune. We did eventually find water fountains but were not sure whether this might upset us. Food generally was very expensive so go prepared to spend a lot.

As for myself, I expected endless lines that moved at snail speed, and a fidgety me wanting nothing more than to get out of there.I was wrong!Yes, the lines to all attractions are long, but they move at a steady pace, and usually, there is something to look at while you are waiting. For example, at the line to  Meet the Princesses , there are the significant objects encased in glass on the wall for the kids to look at, i.e. Cinderella's slipper, the rose from Beauty and the Beast, etc. So the kids never start complaining, and your nerves remain intact.The rides were all fun! Travelling alone with my 2 daughters, I joined them on all the rides, and they were as fun for me as they were for them.There are plenty of food & drink outlets, offering a variety of choices. The big cinema restaurant is good if you want a longer break, as kids will be watching cartoons on the big screen.If possible, do buy a  Fast track pass    it will save you a lot of waiting time in the lines.The train station is located directly outside the park, so if you dont want to stay at one of the Disney Land Paris hotels, you can make a day trip.

We had not realised and were prepared for crowds but in the end it was relatively quiet in the morning, getting much busier as the day wore on. We stayed elsewhere and bought a 2park, one day pass. We arrived in time for rope drop and quickly got a couple of the more popular rides completed. We got fast passes for another ride or two, but in the end these were not required (you do not pay extra for these, you just go to the machines and flash your ticket). We made the mistake of going for lunch at lunchtime and everything was pretty busy except the Sports bar which did good food and was relatively empty. MacDonalds was heaving! We took adult friends who had not seen any Disney parks before and they were absolutely thrilled. Unfortunately it is not the cheapest of places to visit   especially if the Euro rate is against you but we really enjoyed it (having dome the Florida parks a few times).

Hours of queing to get on any ride that is worth goiung on, in total we spent about 7 hours in queues for about 40 minutes of rides. This is grteatly due to their fast pass system. Those of us who pay to go to the park and cannot lash out again on a fast pass (just a way of Disney making more money out of you) end up just waiting even longer in the queues because of those with the fast pass. mkae you feal like real secondclass citizens. On top of that absolutely everything in the park ios over priced, 19.00 Euro for a liitle photo and so on.

168127833,2,2013-7,Australia,"Our first Disneyland experiance, and VERY sad to say probably our last.Our trip to Disnetland Paris started off of a very poor footing (see my review for Dream Castle to understand), but that was yesterday, today we start living our dreams, or maybe not.So off into living our childhood dreams we go, the day started out brillantly, I highly recommend the Tower of Terror, the 8 of us who went on it could not stop laughing, it was very well setup and the staff really got into their role playing, an excellant ride.As to was the Rock N Roller coaster, Crush's Coaster and Space Mountain 2, and despite having to queue for all of the rides, we loved them.Then it our dream ride came to a horrible stop, the first one happened after we queued for 55 minutes for the Indiana Jones ride, only to be told that it was now closed due to  technical  issues, so off we went to the next ride (Pirates of the Caribbean) and again, after being in the queue for over 40 minutes.Ok, so these things happen, off to Buzz LIght Year, now the lines are really getting long (mayhap to do with the rides being closed), we were in the line for 70 minutes, and low and behold, the dreaded anouncment comes saying that this to is closed.This patern was repeated on 5 more rides, it's now pushing 9 pm by this time, we have been in the parks since they opened (10am) and have manged to get onto a total of seven (7) rides, the upside is that we all manged to work on our tans whilst standing in the never ending queues, which would have all been great, had we managed to actually get to the rides that we were queuing for.We ended up visiting the Town Hall (office) to lodge our concerns, the poor lstaff at the desk were being attacked from every direction, and our sympathy well and truly went out to them, while they were fending of disgrunted people from amost every corner of the planet.The lady that we dealt with told us the the  technical  issue was to do with the heat affecting the power, which knowing a bit out this type of issue, appears to be an overload to the power system, which seems to have been addressed by the site controllers by  cycling  the power to various rides to ease the demand on the system, rather than just shuttig down one or two rides for the day. After hearing our issues she gratfully gave us some Fast track tickets to both Buzz Light Year, and Space Mountain (these were the rides that we had mostwanted to go on), we left her to tackle a very p'd lady and off to grab our last rides for the day.Well that was our plan, to everyones pure delight (NOT) both of the rides were out of service.This is the point were we all gave up and decided that the hotel was a better option.For our next attempt at such outings, we're thinking of trying one of the Universal or Six Flag attractions, for if this is how Disney runs a park, then we'll be giving them all a massive berth.Gary",Disneyland_Paris

168022683,5,2013-7,Romania,"This was our first visit do Disneyland Paris, wishing to make our kids of 4.7 yrs a nice holiday present. We traveled by car from Germany and lodged at ResidHome Apparthotels (see my review of this hotel). As the hotel was practically on the doorstep of the RER station Val d'Europe, we used this transportation means to get to Disney.We chose to visit during the week   i.e. Monday and Tuesday   and we probably were right, as there were queues, but not very long (we've never spent more than 20 min in a queue). We only tried the rides for smaller children, which means we spent almost the whole time in Fantasyland and Adventureland. We spent a whole day in the park, with a short afternoon nap break in the hotel, until around 10 p.m. when the kids were too tired to go on, so we missed the Disney Dreams show at 11.00, but there is always a next time!Pluses: clean, great rides, short queues, lots of alternatives. The parade at 7 p.m. was great indeed and the kids enjoyed the moment.Minuses: poor organisation for Mickey Mouse house (that was one we missed due to the poorly organised queue) and princess reservation (we couldn't get fast passes for the hour we wanted, so, after staying 20 min in a queue all I got was a reservation for 3 p.m. when my kids had to sleep...); not enough fast passes for all rides; poor and expensive food and drinks; the toys and princess dresses in the shops are highly overpriced, beware!; was very disappointed as virtually no Disney characters were walking through the park during the day. We caught a glimpse of Rabbit from Winnie the Pooh, but it was even more disappointing! Also, another disappointment was that not all Disney movies are featured in the park (kids asked about the Aristocats, Dalmatians, Jungle Book, Lion King and had no clue what to answer them).Favourite ride: Peter Pan Flight and A Small World (the latter not to miss!!!). The Dragon's cave (right before the entrance of the Castle) is also good, but many people miss it because of its position, as it is not very well marked.As for Adventureland, it is great indeed (Robinson's Cabin is amazing, and so is the Pirate adventure). We spent time in the Pirate playground, which is very well equipped. Next time we will definitely get 1 day 2 parks tickets, so we can combine the 2 parks at least one day. Or maybe even a Passport, which is worth it if you go at least two times a year.For kids under 6 yrs old, strollers are a must (there are also to rent in the park), I saw even older kids 9 10 yrs in strollers, as it is very tiring for their little feet.All in all, a great experience, but would really like to try the  real  Disneylands in the US.",Disneyland_Paris

We found our shuttle for our hotel easily as well   and spent the following day at Disneyland. The ticket agent did try to get us to do the park hopper, but we just stuck with one park for the day. It did take us the entire day to see and do everything at Disneyland   did not feel we would have had time to make both parks and enjoy everything. If you have more than one day   then I would definitely do both parks   but we travelled from Kansas and wanted to just experience Disneyland. The Disney staff was so friendly   easy to get around and ask questions to the staff. We LOVED the entire day! Make sure you don't miss the evening fireworks show   it is amazing! We got our spot about an hour early   right in front of the castle   but the French can be rude   so don't be surprised if the crowd tries to get right in front of you! Overall, a FANTASTIC day at Disneyland paris   would go back again!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
167919047,2,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Having taken our own Children to Disney World Florida , Disneyland Paris is a very poor second in both location, Staff & actual co ordination of many of the events. Took our 7 year old Granddaughter to have her be upset on several occasions as the Character Guides had the well known Gallic attitude of just standing around as pushy parents blatantly pushed their Child to the front of the queue for character autographs. Did not seem at all interest at the call of many parents to stop letting French children in first and just shrugged their Shoulders and in most cases just turned there backs towards you. Paid extra to stay at the Newport Hotel with the promise of early access to find on one of the days we went down to get in early to Magic Kingdom was told by the Gate Guide that they where not letting in people early that day without any other reason, asked to see a manager and just got the usual gallic Shoulder Shrug which also was the response to all the other annoyed early bird ticket holders. My advice is save up and get a real Disney Experience at Disney World Florida.. As for the food quality the best food on offer was off site at McDonalds if you didn't mind a very long queue which will show how poor the food quality was. On several occasions had to return stone cold food back to the provider where you noticed they just put the food back on the food tray to pass on to another customer who would not probably complain. The last point is I live in Yorkshire and the Weather is really poor in this area of France with a cold wind blowing in most areas of Disneyland Paris. We will not return to Disneyland Paris a very poor place and Disney should really send in management from America to sort out what is a expensive poorly run Disney Park",Disneyland_Paris
167892586,2,2013-7,United Kingdom,"We went to Paris Disney having been to both parks in the USA. It was a miserable experience four rides were either broken or developed faults. Drinks were difficult to get hold of after 1800. Almost every queue time was too short in one case by almost an hour. We queued 55 mins for one ride which when we arrived at the front stopped working. It was strange seeing people smoking. In America my overall impression was one of joy and people having fun. In Paris almost everyone was glum. If you have small children this could be fun, everyone else should try other amusement parks.",Disneyland_Paris
167891836,5,2013-7,Lebanon,"Review Disney: take the time to read the below; 5 days experience noted in details; the best thing in Disney is the prior know how that will make or break your vacation.  LOGISTICS: the most important thing is the logistics; get a back bag to put the stuff in it; the    exclusive    Vittel water has a funny taste that kids may not like; so if you have kids that may need milk; get your water from airport before heading to Disney. Also Make sure that you reserve the restaurants before getting there for the best time; sunscreen, caps, etc   .. The Stroller is a must; bring one with you if it is light or rent one there; the fee is 15 euros per day and you get the chance to use it at both parks for same day if you plan to go on both parks. (keep the receipt with you in case someone accidentally takes your rented stroller)HOTEL: if you can afford it; stay in Disney hotels; the extra you pay is worth it. Starting from skipping the hassle of security; to queuing for tickets. I stayed at NY hotel and had the privilege of going back after the Parade at 7:30 for a 2.5 hours swimming, relaxing, dinner break before hitting the park again for the 20th anniversary show. Not to mention that every day you will have the Characters showing up at your hotel; thus a great opportunity for autographs and pics. TRANSPORTATION: you can reserve the VEA shuttle; it will cost 20 euors plus or minus per person; if you are agroup of 4; take a taxi; it will get you to your hotel in half the time. if you are staying for a longer period; then the Shuttle experince is nice for the kids and offers them an opportunity to see other hotels. no need to reserve online as the shuttles are not always full; they leave every 45 minutes and are easy to detect at gate 8. RESTAURANTS: again; if you can afford it; if you are staying in Disney buy the half board option; you get the choice of best restaurants at the park and lots of them have a buffet that is great for kids tastes and choice especially if they are coming from abroad. The best timing is breakfast at 9:30; lunch at 3:00 (unless it is at Caf   Mickey; then you need to reserve earlier as characters stop showing at 3: pm) and dinner at 9:30. This gives you the best time to watch the Parades; have fun, and actually have fun. Again if you can afford it; a reservation at Auberege De Cendrillon is worth the time; (the food is average); yet your kids will meet 3 princess at once! You can reserve your restos at the Concierge or at the entrance of the park on the left hand side when you enter. PARADES: unfortunately; the Parade at Disney is a nightmare; you have to sit as early as 6 pm to reserve a place at the sidewalk to enjoy the show; what make things worse are the people who careless about children and stand thus preventing kids from seeing the show. Make sure that you reserve a decent seat at 6:30 pm in the shade. You don   t have to worry about the 4 pm Parade at the studios as they start at 4pm; with lots of space, enjoyable experience and much much less people. CHARACTERS AUTOGRAPHS the Walt Disney Studios is the best for collecting them; you can have access to marry Poppins, Cinderella, Stitch, Mulan, etc    with relatively accessible and fast ques. The princess Pavillion is nice; you have to go there to get the tickets for the appointment; the distribution times are 10:30; 11:45; 13:45 and 16:45 (next to the Mulan windmill). Go there 15 minutes before; if you don   t want your kids to que for distribution; take their access tickets for Disney and just show them how many you have. you will get access for the number of park access cards you show them. they can   t tell which princess timing is; so you have to count on luck. RIDES ATTRACTIONS if you have kids less than 5 or daughters; then Fantasyland is your destination; avoid Dumbo trap and Carrousel; go for the it   s a small world section, Peter Pan, Railroad station, Pinocchio world, sleeping beauty, dragon dungeon, Alice   s maze, Le Pays de Conte de Fe. If you have boys; go to Adventure land and have fun with the Pirates rides as well as Discovery land with Buzz. If you have a mix crowd; best is: peter Pan, it   s a small world, Alice   s maze, pirates rides and boats plus Buzz world. STUDIOS: depending on the weather forecast; choose your visit to coincide with windy or rainy weather as most of attractions are indoor; start with Animagique; Cinemagique; Stitch Live, Disney play house (for kids less than 5); the action motor show and dine at the restaurant of the Stars where you get to watch Ratatouille show. Remember the Parade is at 4 pm; so leave the motor stunt show till after the ride. If you have the time; go to the Hollywood production set. Face paintings is a must for kids as it gets them to live the experience; while at the Studios it is conveniently at the entrance; unfortunately in the park it is inconveniently behind the Castle!the Studios close at 7 pm; so you have teh time to watch the other Parade if you would like to run for it. however, if you end up shouting on your kids and drag them to watch the Parade (as we saw some parents doing); then it wont be that memorable experience for them!!! FAST PASS: asked for an upgrade to a Suite while at the hotel; the cost was not cheap; yet significantly lower than when I wanted to book the suite over the phone. Bottom line, you get an easy pass and a fast pass throughput your stay at Disney. The cost of the upgrade was less than the cost of 4 Fastpass of 240 euros per day for a party of 4. It was WORTH it big time; you pay more, but believe me, cost efficient in Disney does not mean Cheapest; it is Value for money and we had the chance with the Fast pass to take some rides twice, have a breakfast at a designated area in the hotel (less crowded) with Characters showing up. I say what the hell; if it is a once in a life time vacation for your kids; do it the right way and save the extra 100 euros per month for the upgrades that will make a BIG difference for kids and a more relaxing experience for Adults. THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY SHOW: this is a MUST WATCH; do not kill yourself trying to get closer to the round about where it is hectic, crowded and again careless adults obstruct the kids eyesight. Stand at the end of the Main street facing the Castle. I am talking from experience, had 4 nights to watch; the best was the two ones that we distanced ourselves a bit to the back; less crowds; better visibility and you don   t get smashed when the show is over. Don   t kill yourself videotaping it; you will find much better quality on YouTube for your kids watching later; take only some pics for the little ones watching it. i spent more times watching th enchantment, magic effect and expressions on my kids faces rather than the actual shows. Finally I would say that Disney is a vacation for kids; a memorable experience; do NOT try to impose the rides that you may think they will like; if they prefer to stand 20 minutes looking at the dragon so be it. Again, I reiterate that you consider where to stay; it I true that the intention is the park and the hotel is only a stop. Yet, with the right hotel, services, you can relax more, charge up faster and be ready for the adventure. We stayed 4 nights  5 days and it is more than enough; the minimum is 3 nights ( you need 8 hours for teh park including dining and resting and 6 hours for teh studios as it is tied to the shows); I won   t recommend any stay less than 3 nights unless you and your kids are related to Ussain Bolt and have the genes of marathon runner Gebri Selassie.",Disneyland_Paris
167884654,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,We took our 6 year old granddaughter for a few days. The park is a little girl's dream! Very busy and long queuing times for most rides but always something going on to keep the kids happy. Best part for all of us was the parades and firework displays at the end of the night is amazing. Meeting Snow White and having her picture taken with her was another highlight for our girl. Although I was surprised that we didn't see too many characters walking about but could be we just missed them. The parks are spotless and have several places to eat which although not cheap were much the same as any other theme park.Definitely would recommend going but you need to take plenty of spending money!!,Disneyland_Paris
167873375,2,2013-7,Australia,"Disneyland Paris is getting very tired. On the day we were there several rides broke down, it didn't help that we had been standing in line for quite some time and then told that the ride had been stopped. The staff were sloppily dressed and unenthusiastic. Food was expensive and awful and service slow and unhelpful. I went to Disneyland in America and it was fabulous, rides worked, staff were friendly and helpful and the whole place magical. Disneyland Paris could do with a bit more magic.",Disneyland_Paris
167851676,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"What can I say? Visited with the family (myself, wife 2 daughters (one 19 and one 6) and son (15) and everyone on entering the park reverted to being 8 years old again. Running around trying to get on everything and see all the sites, a really full day. Would advise 2 days if possible to allow you to take everything in.Arrived at 10:30 (park opens at 10:00) and stayed for 8 hours with a final meal at Planet Hollywood before driving back to Picardie. Wear comfortable shoes is my biggest tip as you will walk all day round the park.Slightly disappointed as a couple of rides were closed and there were some big queues (45 50 minute waits), but, what do you expect for visiting in July.Can't wait to return.",Disneyland_Paris
167758132,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"I have to say that I enjoyed Disney land Paris more than Orlando. I found teh facilities more buggy friendly, the rides better and overall had a better time.   It's a short trip and a lovely experience for the kids (and adults)",Disneyland_Paris
167691068,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Some very good attractions and some not so good. Queuing is awful but my son has a disability which meant we didn't queue   they have this very well thought out for disabled visitors. The only slight grumble is that for some events they only allow 1 adult with a disabled child, which meant separating us into two groups. Whereas for disabled adults, the whole party are allowed to go in. I understand that they do this to comply with EU legislation (where an adult carer has to be allowed to accompany a disabled person) but common sense would dictate that you shouldn't separate families   surely it's a children's attraction? We felt as if they were discriminating against disabled children by doing this. The other thing we noticed was that they didn't allow disabled people to chose which seats they used, whereas they allowed able bodied people to   that is discriminatory and is in breach of EU equality directives. Poor show in this respect.",Disneyland_Paris
167690292,5,2012-12,South Africa,"Even though its a little delayed, my childhood dreams came true, I finally made it to the world of fun and fantasy. It's a lot to take in and I literally felt like I was in a different world, I can only imagine how amazing it must be for young kids! Comfortable shoes are a must and water. The fast passes really do make a difference as we were able to go on every ride we wanted to and even a little extra. The standout rides were, Tower of Terror, Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain, Star Wars one and the Aerosmith ride. The shows that we're really entertaining was the Armageddon set, where you are actually on the set that explodes etc (little kiddies won't like that), and the Animagic show, which really brought the Disney magic alive, literally and made me feel sad and nostalgic that I wasn't 6 anymore, but it was really entertaining and gave us a break off our tired feet.",Disneyland_Paris
167658187,3,2013-7,United States,"Visited for four nights with my wife and Granddaughter (6). Second visit to Eurodisney (15 years ago) and have visited Disney in Florida seven times over a 23 year period (latest 2 years ago). The parks are not upto the standard that you find in the States. In the States everything is manicured, no rubbish, character costumes immaculate, not full of continentals who cannot queue and have no manners I could go on. However what tips can I give on how to get the best out of the experience. If you can afford it go to a Disney hotel. This gives you access to part of the park between 8.00 am and 10,00 am,. This is especially useful if you have small children who want to go on Dumbo, Peter Pan, Carousel, Buzz Lightyear. The queues are much smaller on these at this time. We went via Eurostar which goes directly to the park. The Disney express luggage service was excellent. This transported your luggage to your Disney hotel so we were able to have a look at the park before going to our hotel. Use fastpass wisely. The queue on Big Thunder Mountain was always over an hour but we managed to go on it twice using fastpass within three hours. Try to eat in the Disney village. The food in the parks is hugely expensive and rubbish. We even had to queue for 25 minutes just to order our food and is what not even busy at the time. Suspend all belief in value for money. There is no value for money in anything. Go in the summer. We were lucky and the weather was very good. It must be pretty miserable in the winter being in the parks. If you have a little girl who wants to have a princess dress buy it in Sainsbury before you go at   16 rather than spending upto 90 Euros in Disney. The best advise is to save up and go to Florida. The weather is better year round the natives are friendlier, there is so much extra to do and the biggest bonus is they speak English. The big show in the Studios is the stunt show which is mainly narrated in French. May sound negative but my granddaughter loved it and I am sure that every child has a wonderful time so if you have booked it please do not be put off by this review. Every child should have a chance to go to Disney even if it is in France and lets face it Disney is for kids!",Disneyland_Paris

167587741,5,2013-7,United States,"I've been to Disney World 5 times. This was my first time ever at Disneyland. We were not disappointed. We traveled with my 7 year old son, who has Autism, and my 4 year old daughter. The Guest Services personnel were so courteous and respectful when we got a Guest Assistance Card. Each cast member that we interacted with were extremely polite and helpful. My son tends to get over excited, and they were all just great about it. My daughter ran to all of the characters to get autographs. They were so kind, and seemed to really enjoy and understand the magnitude of their role for the memories of the kids that they were seeing. Alice, the Madhatter, Tiana (the parade  Royal Hall one) and the two Cinderellas that we came across were the best. I would definitely recommend this park to anyone. The parade was a bit short, but the princesses made my daughter day by blowing kisses at her.",Disneyland_Paris
167527507,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge hotel on site at the Disneyland Paris resort. The hotel was fairly expensive due to its close proximity to the park but was of a standard less than a Premier Inn in the UK even though we were 'upgraded' upon arrival to a room with a kettle and a coffee machine? The only tea and coffee that was available was in the mini bar at   6 for three coffee pods. Milk was available in the hotel shop in a small carton of around the size of a child's juice drink.The general state of the hotel was 'tired' and every surface was dusty.The buffet in the restaurant at the hotel was good for both breakfast and evening meal.Make sure that you check in early as the breakfast slots go quickly. We were given a 9.45 am slot for each of the four days that we were there but this wastes so much of the day we went into the breakfast room at 7.30 am and there was never any problem accepting our ticket.,Disneyland_Paris
167498837,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"We have been to Orlando so felt a little like we were comparing them all the time but it is smaller than the magic kingdom there but still a great park.The downsides are that food and souvenirs are shockingly expensive but most people are aware of this before they go. Rolls for   10 each and   5 for drinks... wow.We got our tickets as part of the deal for staying in a Disney property and we also got our parking paid. A good deal due to   15 for parking per day and   139 per 2 day ticket.Queues were huge 60 to 90 minutes were common on all the rides so we needed the 5 day tickets we got with the accomodation. Everything was good and the rides were great. Watch what you buy for the prices and remember that queuing for most European countries is a strange idea. They just barge you out the road and take offence when you try to tell them about queues. This may really annoy you after a while, it did with me.",Disneyland_Paris
167440500,4,2013-6,United States,"This attraction was tops on our granddaughters'  wish List  for things to do in Paris, even the Eiffel Tower came in second to the mouse! We took the metro from our rental apartment in Paris to the Opera stop then the RER that left us off literally at the front entrance to the park. It couldn't have been easier or more convenient. We didn't buy tickets before we arrived and were pleasantly surprised to be offered a special that was much less than we expected to pay.We had read many negative reviews and we live only 2 hours from Disney World in Orlando so we go often and were not really sure what to expect. The park is definitely smaller (a plus as far as I'm concerned) but the variety of rides and attractions were fine. Our granddaughters enjoyed seeing a different princess castle than the one they're used to in Orlando and there are some attractions that we don't have so that was fun for them. The park was clean, most staff were pleasant and helpful, a few were rude but that's really no different than anywhere else, is it? We ate two meals in the park and the quality was decent, the prices were what you'd expect to pay at an amusement park although we thought the quality was somewhat better and the prices less than we pay in Orlando. The girls are used to having many opportunities throughout the day to meet the princesses and taking pictures with them in Orlando and that isn't the case at this park so that was a little disappointing for them, however they had a great time and are still talking about their Paris Disney adventure.",Disneyland_Paris
167385017,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"I had heard wonderful reports of the Disneyland experience from friends with very similarly aged children   talk of pure magic, the staff putting themselves out, lots of  Disney Magic Moments .....thats simply not how it is in France. Yes, some of the staff were lovely but many were simply disinterested or surly. I found the nicest staff to be in the shops. The prices were awful   we were there during a heatwave and drinks were all overpriced and very small   150mls for orange juice for the children. There are water fountains but the water is not nice to drink.Many of the  big ticket  rides had technical problems whilst we were there, making the queues longer.On the plus side   in general our children had a good time   there were enough thrills for the thrill seeker and my smaller ones loved Dumbo and the Mad Hatters tea party. Our hotel   The Sequoia Lodge   was very nice and the swimming pool there was wonderful   the children were more excited by that than anything really.I have to say I expected far more  magic , far more characters around the park, better service, a lot of going  above and beyond  which really didn't happen.I doubt that the lack of  magic  is what Walt envisaged. Everyone tells me that I should give it another go and save for Orlando, frankly having been to France I don't want to give them any more money..!",Disneyland_Paris
167370205,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Just back from Disneyland and it was truly magical. Went with a six year old and she was amazed by everthing. The castle looked beautiful and there was lots of rides that catered to younger children. Fantasy land would be best for the kids. Queues can be long, I brought my ipod to keep us entertained during the long waits. The first night we arrived at the park at 10:20pm to see the Disney Dreams show at 11pm. We never really got a good view even though we arrived half an hour before the show started. The last night we arrived at the park at 9:45pm and we were two rows from the front. The best thing was that at the front you are required to sit so everyone can see. This was good as we could enjoy the show in comfort and with a good seat, so I would advise to go early to get a good spot. To meet a princess you are required to obtain a ticket first. Again we queued for 45 mins before they started distributing the tickets. You are given a time slot when you have to come back. We assumed you could meet all or at least a few princesses, but when we arrived we realised you only had the chance to meet one. This didn't spoil the occasion but we had to join the queue the next day to meet another princess. You are able to take photos but there is also a photographer. One photo is 15euro or we got the pack of three with frames for 30euro.Food and juices are very expensive. For water or a fizzy juice it is a standard 3.09 euro in every shop. There is a few fast food places which is generally 10.99 euro for a chicken burger, chips and a drink. Last note goes to the staff of Disneyland, They are all great and cheery. Many of them speak multiple lanuages and will always keep the smile on you face.",Disneyland_Paris
167354392,4,2013-6,Australia,"Our family of 4 were going to Dland Paris even with all the mixed reviews. We lived in Southern California and went to Dland many times a year. Dland Paris is smaller, but laid out like Dland in California with a few changes. We had a great day. We planned on riding 4 rides, but ended up doing a bit more. It is crowded just like any amusement park. Look at the map get a game plan so you are not running around from place to place. Try to stick to one area and do all you can there and then move on. We have 2 teenagers so it was easy to move at a steady pace, when you have younger ones it does take a little longer. Food: I don't know why reviewers complain about the price. I found very comparable to any amusement park. We at Pizzeria Bella Notte (by Small World) the price was really good and the food was fine. They offer combo meals such as pizza, salad, drink or lasagna, salad, drink and a few more I cannot remember. For the 4 of us it was around $55 euro. No matter where you go as soon as you enter a restaurant split such as someone does the ordering and someone go get a table. If it is a nice day there are tables outside.Smoking: Dland Paris does state smoking in designated areas, but that is not the case. Luckily you are in a outdoor area and the smoking isn't to much of a bother. Once you start queuing for rides, there is no smoking. Even though some tried, they were told to put it out. I don't smoke, but it wasn't as bad as I thought.Rides: We got there before it opened and certain sections were roped off. Just wait with everyone else and plan to walk very fast and go with the flow once that rope is removed. No kidding, it is crazy. Pick the ones you really want to go to and do those. You may not get to all the rides, but if you do what you really want you won't be disappointed. You might have to wait awhile in line, but at least you got to ride the one you wanted.Overall I found Dland Paris somewhat clean. It wasn't disgusting or as horrible as I have read. I was almost expecting squalor and it was so far from that. Staff: Most staff were friendly. No one was rude. Just doing their job and moving people through the line.I would so go and have a great time. Don't have grand ideas or expectations and you won't be disappointed. We had a great time and glad we went. Afterall, it is Disneyland.",Disneyland_Paris

We might have done it the hard way by not staying near or around the Disney village but Disneyland wasn't the sole focus of their trip. Took the train back to Paris after the lightshow fireworks finished and got back to the hotel all on public transport (albeit very late). It was worth staying for the lightshow as even I was impressed! The train back to Paris was a bit confusing. Everyone was seated comfortably on the train and an announcement comes over and people start leaving and literally running to the front carriages. No English translation was given but surmised that only some of the front carriages were leaving the station!

Disney Paris is so far removed from this and I couldn't wait to get home, the day dragged and the experience was terrible, rides lacked the fun in Florida. Everything so expensive and not worth the money!!! Disney should remove their name from this place and just charge them for using the names of their rides, this place ruined the trust and good name of Disney, it was tatty and dirty and not very well put together. The Disney hotel we stayed in was Newport Bay Club and it also ruined the Disney name, employees couldn't be bothered and the halls stank of dirt and BO.

167077655,3,2013-6,United States,"Writing this review from the viewpoint of a regular Disney Park visitor from the US. My review is really to give folks from the US an expectation of the park compared to Disneyland and DisneyWorld in the US. I am glad we went and we had a very good time, but we walked away thinking that it was not quite up to Disney standards. I just want to temper your expectations. If this is your first visit to a Disney Park it will still be amazing, just not as good as the US parks. I believe this is a result of a lack of investment in the park during the build as well as a lack of investment to keep the park fresh and updated over the last 20 years. If you have been to the parks in the US you will notice and be disappointed by several things. Here is what struck me the most:   The park is well maintained and manicured like in the US, however it is definitely not as clean. The bathrooms were pretty gross and trash was left on the grounds. Clean up crew is not efficient as at the US parks.    I did not find the lines that long compared to the US parks, however the efficiency of the ride operators is not as good and not quite as friendly. So that made the wait at some rides seem longer.    Food selection and healthy choices here have not caught up with the US parks yet.    Disney Village compared to Downtown Disney is a huge disappointment. World of Disney Store is pretty small and does not carry half the stuff we saw inside the park. Restaurant selection is much worse and there are no entertainment options to speak of. Had dinner at RainForest Cafe, menu was totally different and the food was awful. Skip Disney Village except for maybe grabbing a sandwich for lunch.    Space Mountain is nothing like in the US, some may like it better but we were very disappointed. It is still in the dark but more like the Matterhorn with a loop and corkscrew.    Indiana Jones was also totally different, again a roller coaster ride and not the big jeeps like in the US. Not that it's a bad thing, but the ride was just OK. Better than Space Mountain.    Star Tours is the  old  version, it has not been updated as in the US. It seems a bit outdated and cheesy and the ride is not as good.    Pirates has not been updated with any of the Jack Sparrow figures like in the US, and Small World also has not been updated to include Disney characters like in the US. Both were still good though. We stayed in the heart of Paris and took the train out to the park from Auber station. This was very convenient and easy and I recommend doing that rather trying to take the Disney Bus. No problem with seats on the train, it runs frequently, and the station is right at the park entrance. It was about $65 US for 4 of us round trip.",Disneyland_Paris
167070736,4,2013-7,Canada,"Expectations were high for my visit to Disneyland Paris. Although it was for the most part enjoyable, it lacked that sparkle that makes a visit to a Disney park so special. Interestingly enough, Disneyland Paris is a mix of several of the US Disney parks,  borrowing  popular rides from many of the different locationsWhat I liked: Well, this is a Disney Park so there is something for everyone. Rides for the little ones, thrill rides for the older ones and so on. Plenty of Disney merchandising options (although way overpriced   by any standards), several dining options. The ride areas and the main streets are clean and safe. Waiting time for most rides is quite reasonable (especially when compared to Magic Kingdom). FastPass system for some of the most popular rides. The park is relatively compact   but big enough so that there is enough to do for a full day. The  buffet dining , although pricey, was relatively goodWhat to watch for   could be improved: To showcase only one main and very short parade as well as an hourly celebration train is very light as far as entertainment is concerned (Walt Disney Studios has pretty much all the shows). It is also fairly light on the meet and greet Disney characters. Other than dinner with the princesses, there is no other onsite  character dining  options, unless you go in Disney Village. The merchandising reminds you that you are in a Disney Park, but at times, you feel like you could be in any theme parks. Toilets WC were also another area of concern   many of them were plain disgusting   even in some of the premium dining areas. Staff did not look really happy to be working there, with some being just plain rude. The park layout also does not make it the most easy to navigate as there was no directions signs directing to the different sections of the park once you where within one sectionOverall, we did have a great time and will keep good memories of many of the rides that we have been on (the little one sure remembers it!). However, when it comes to the full Disney experience, nothing beats the  original' Disney parks in California and Orlando",Disneyland_Paris
167051125,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"I love everything about this park. The theming of the Lands, the rides, the music, the smell of Main St USA...   It is up there with my favourite places on the planet, I honestly don't know what else to say about it, I love it.",Disneyland_Paris
167015087,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"Husband and I travelled in June and stayed for 3 days in the parks with our 2 children, girls aged 2 and 3 and another family of husband and wife and their 2 boys aged 1 and 3.We stayed in the Sequoia Lodge (separate review).Getting into the park was straightforward and never took too long to get through the security check and turnstile. Staff on entrance were the friendliest we encountered.Although this was our second trip to Disneyland Paris, it was our first with children and that makes a big difference to the experience. The wonderment and joy of our girls when they first set eyes on Sleeping Beauty's castle was amazing. We headed straight to Fantasyland and queues were not too bad, between 5 and 20 minutes depending on the ride. It's a small world, Peter Pan, Pinocchio, Tea cups and Alice in Wonderland maze all fantastic rides attractions. Unfortunately, Dumbo was closed throughout the 3 days for maintenance so cannot review that. Most disappointing was the carousel, queued a good 20 minutes and the ride lasts about 90 seconds. Even my 3 year old said  is that it?  It's a small world was a firm favourite and in 3 days we rode it about 6 times! Never queued more than a few minutes.Lunch was disappointing, we went to the 'Famous Hot Dogs' on main street, the usual long queue for food, abrupt service from staff and extortionate fast food. 2 hot dogs, 1 nuggets, 3 fries and 2 drinks    45, food nothing special.We watched the early evening parade on the first night and it was spectacular. Make sure you find a good spot at the front at lease an hour before it starts so that you can see everything. It's worth the wait. The atmosphere is fantastic and the children were in awe.On the 2nd day we went to studios. Highlights of the day, flying carpets, terror tower, studio tram tour. Unfortunately we couldn't get onto crush's coaster, the queue was never below an hour. The best thing we saw and well worth a look was 'Animagique'. What an incredible show the special effects were amazing and all the songs were Disney favourites. Such realistic and convincing characters. We were so impressed and only went in by chance.The cars parade was good, not as spectacular as the Disney parade but still worth watching and there was much less in the way of crowds and people pushing and shoving. On the last day we went back to the main Disney park and redid all the best bits again. Queues were longer the park was busier so we only managed 6 rides. We had a really nice lunch in adventure land 'Hakuna Matata' very good, still expensive but food was much nicer and better value. Pirates of the Caribbean is excellent we went on twice. Biggest highlight of the whole stay was princess meet and greet, our girls met and had photographs with princess aurora which they absolutely loved. However, it was nightmare to queue first for a ticket at a designated time and then queue again at a later designated time to meet the princess. Fortunately only I had to queue for the tickets so my husband took the girls off whilst I waited for almost an hour. However, later we all had to queue for another hour before it was our turn. it was worth it, it made their holiday. the princess made a real effort to engage with them.We stayed to see the parade again, slightly disappointing it wasn't as good as the first night, a few floats were missing and the children noticed.Overall an amazing time had by all.Good: the look of the park, attention to detail is fantastic, clean and magical.The rides are excellentParadesWater fountains for filling up your bottlesPrincess meet and greetNot so good: queues for foodFood prices!!!!Some staff around the park and ride attendants grumpy, no Disney magic!Lack of characters around the park, we saw Goofy over and over again and Mary Poppins was there every day what about others? We only saw Buzz Lightyear in studios and Goofy again!!! Magic hours   nothing is open!!!Needs a shop for essentials, i.e. medicines, baby wipes etc.Nothing much for babiesLack of signage around the park, no information boards dotted around with queue times, show times etc, this would be very useful in planning your day.My husband has been to the USA parks which he says are much better, but for myself and the children with nothing to compare to I thought the parks were fantastic. A few little touches are missing in terms of customer service which is a shame. But if you go with the right expectations, i.e. it's incredibly expensive, expect to queue, French staff are surly etc you won't be too disappointed!",Disneyland_Paris
167014347,4,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Be prepared if you go in summer, a good 50% of your time will be spent in long, hot queues, some for over an hour! The parks are well set out and with the map, pretty easy to negotiate, but lots of walking and all on concrete paths! It is a magical experience for children, especially the parades and firework finale at night, but plan in advance what you want to see, get fast passes whenever possible and if your child is under 5 take or hire a buggy (   15 for the day) A few irritating things; not enough shade in hot weather, very few seating areas, difficult to get into restaurants after 6pm and the biggy...VERY expensive!! We were a party of 5 adults and 3 children, we had dinner one night in Planet Holywood in the Village, starters, mains, bottle of the cheapest wine, a few beers and soft drinks, and we didn't order food for the youngest child as he shared....   345!! A great experience but not for the faint hearted!!!",Disneyland_Paris

166904805,5,2013-6,Australia,"Loved it, its magical from the second you walk through the gates and hear the music. We spent a day here and should have done more research and planned the day a bit better. Lots to see and do, even in the rain. You have to queue for every ride, sometimes upto an hour (fast pass next time!)Disney characters are around the park throughout the day but they come with minders and again you have to wait tor autographs or photos and people get pissed off waiting push in it's nasty!Plenty of places to eat although its pricey, lots of stalls around to grab a snack. There are lots of gift shops with everything you can imagine just make sure if you buy anything fragile you ask them to pack it well.Tip would be to do your research, get there early and queue to get in before the gates open. Then go straight to the most popular ride before the queue starts and think about the option of a fastpass or you'll never get on all the rides you want as you spend all day queuing.Disappointed at the end as we decided to wait until the end of the day to go on splash mountain, just incase we got wet and it was closed.",Disneyland_Paris
166897472,3,2013-6,South Africa,"We spend a day at Disneypark in June and all my 3 year old wanted to see were the disney prinsesses and other characters. Well we stood in line for about 45 min to get a time to meet a princess, then when we go at the time given, we had to stand in line for an hour again. There were only 2 princesses and you had to take which ever one was given to you.There were no princesses around the park and barely any characters to be seen anywhere! Very very dissapointing! Another problem at the park is that there are no info kiosk around! Other than these problems Disney was quite magical!",Disneyland_Paris
166887891,4,2013-5,United Kingdom,"The park is soooooooooo huge that it takes all your energy and you become moodless. This park is very crowded (yes even on weekday summer) and closes at 11. What i like about this park? many many things to do and see different lands and have different looks adventure land, fantasy land, discovery land I am thrill seeker thus i loved the rides like india jones, thunder mountain and space mountain. Space mountain was the highlight of my trip. Do do do do do go to space mountain. Phanton tower was also uique and was something that can happen only in disnelyland Other 'disney' inspired ride was pirates of Caribbean that i totally adored (donot miss that) If you like cute rides then peterpan, snowhite, pockimon were also good and should be done. Sleep beauty castle, tree house and garden was also worth seeing.  The amazing and beautiful laser and fireworks show on the castle at 11pm. What I dint like? Expensive food. yes do carry your snack with you. One burger will cost you 7 euro For rides there were huge lines all thanks to stupid managing people. We stand in line for 1 hour and they say  we are sorry we have technical faults, but that is a mere a lie. All they want is that people leave the queue so that they have shorter line. This is nothing but playing with emotions. The park is too big and you just cant complete it in one go.",Disneyland_Paris
166823755,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Disney is celebrating 20 years this year, but I can't help wondering if the park is starting to show its age and reveal under investment? We have just returned from a visit and the park suffered a disappointing number of breakdowns. During our time there the following rides suffered what I would class as serious breakdowns:  Space Mountain  Big Thunder Mountain (either closed or queues over 100minutes for our 3 days in park)  Buzz Lightyear  Pirates of the CaribbeanOn our second day (2nd July) all of these rides broke down   Pirates and Thunder Mountain closed for the majority of the afternoon   and Big Thunder Mountain closed into the following morning (3rd July)   with the park staff confirming at the park's (Frontierland) opening that the ride was closed due to technical difficulties. It remained closed all morning, and our daughter's (5yrs and just tall enough) trip was ruined. It also seems that Disney are trimming around the edges   the number of characters out in the park was disappointing given the time of year (it was seriously busy!). The parades also seem to be smaller than when we previously visited   certainly not up to the excellent Fantillusion parade we saw in November 2010. It was still Disney and there was much very good, but having visited previously, one cannot help but notice the flaws this time around. Prior to our trip we had planned to return at Christmas as a family, but following our experience have decided against it.",Disneyland_Paris
166742076,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"my boys loved the park , it was large to walk around with two young children but there was plenty to do other than just the rides. Some of the queues for rides were excessive but on some there is the ability to get a fast pass using your park pass and return to the ride at a selected time so no need to queue for hours. Characters are dotted around the park in specific areas to sign autograph books and pose for pictures as well as some characters just wondering around. These ones should be avoid as its a free for all and everyone is pushing each other including adults pushing and hitting children to get closer. The french do this more than anyone else i could see and i wouldnt waste my time fighting with them to get closer. All in all we loved it here and would return.",Disneyland_Paris
166738894,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"There's something about Disneyland that is just amazing. It's either the incredible atmosphere, your favourite characters waking around before your eyes. The incredible magical castle that towers over the park and the great selection of rides. Food is great, i suggest Plaza Gardens for dinner and Au Chalet de la Marionette for lunch.",Disneyland_Paris
166694685,3,2013-7,United States,"Don't get me wrong. I love Disney. I've been a pass holder at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California for years. I've been to Disney in Orlando, Florida on two occasions and think it's great. My daughter and I spent two days at Disneyland Paris this past July. We couldn't wait to go there. When we first got there, we were hungry. Using the guide that's provided, we started looking for places to eat. We walked around and around going to four different restaurants that were closed! I was astounded. We finally saw a sign indicating which restaurants were open that day. We went to the closest restaurant and it was mobbed. After waiting over an hour to order we finally ate. After eating, we waited in line for Space Mountain and the ride closed down as we got near the front of the line. Then the same thing happened on Pirates of the Caribbean. Then when we went on the Haunted House the ride broke down numerous until we got to the end. It was so bad we both thought it was hilarious and had a good laugh! We trekked over to the Indiana Jones ride which looked great on the guide, but it was closed for refurbishment. We did a few things and had a good time, but the operation did not seem to be as well run as the Anaheim and Orlando parks. However, it is Disney and still very enjoyable. When we finally went on Space Mountain it was a very thrilling ride, much more so than in the US. Some of the food options at the park were very good. Despite everything we had an enjoyable time. We went back the next day to Disneyland Park again and to the Walt Disney Studios Park. Generally speaking, many things were up to Disney standards, such as overall upkeep and clean bathrooms. It was particularly fun to see some of the attractions in French, such as Star Tours. If you're at all planning on going to Disneyland Paris, I would rate it is a must do attraction despite any flaws there may be. After all, it is Disney but with slightly less magic than we've previously experienced. You have to do it at least once!",Disneyland_Paris
166654866,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Spent 5 days at Newport bay hotel....hotel ok, clean room but getting shabby, mixture of staff some rude but bar staff very polite. Even though our room was clean there was on a regular basis stacks of dishes and bottles left in the corridors for days. From outside hotel looks stunning, main restaurant areas are lovely but corridors are long old and smelly.Once we got to the park after waiting for 3 hours for our room and getting my sunglasses stolen from the reception toilets we realised very quickly that we would need alot more spending money than we had anticipated. Burger chips and a drink    14....bottle of coke    6....dinner consisting of 3 pizzas drinks and one bottle of wine in Planet Hollywood    112!! The pushing and shoving by the parents, not the children! to greet the disney characters is shameful....rude and totally unacceptable, my little 3yr old grandson was repeatedly pushed out the way by over excitable parents who we saw running to get pictures of there children with the characters...also would like to add that there was not enough staff and character presence around the park...queues where ridiculous and rides where basic.Defo back to florida next year",Disneyland_Paris
166611828,5,2013-6,Israel,i went to disneyland france with my 2 kids: ages 13 and 9.we had a great time! i looked for tickets for a long time  and finally decided to purchase online from the disneyland site. they have a great offer  3 days for the price of 2 days for both parks. we were there for 2 days  the first day we went to the park and the second day to the studios.since the studios close at 19:00   we went to the park again.dont miss the parade at the park. amazing! and do not miss the car show in the studios! all the resort is very clean; lots of restaursnts. we had a great time!!! dont forget to use the fast pass  great idea!and if you are travelling with young children  you can rent a stroller :),Disneyland_Paris
166590634,5,2013-7,United Kingdom,"We've just come back from our honeymoon here with the kids. Our first visit. We came back with spending money as it wasnt as expensive as we thought it would be. And we brought practically the Disney shop home. But we have dream annual passes so get great discounts. Feet ache, queues pretty long (but you do have option of fastpass), plenty of food places (which are ranked in price   handy), lots of shops (not all shops sell the same, but items are the same price in every shop which is great. The christmas shop in the castle is beautiful) very friendly staff (everyone smiles and joked with the kids).The only problem we had with it is the food. EVERTHING is fries. Burger & fries, hot dog & fries etc or sandwiches. We eventually found the buffet in central plaza. Finally found some veg. The kids eat every bit, even they were sick of the same fast food rubbish.I reccommend Annettes Diner in the Disney Village. Lovely american breakfast. Closest you'll get to a fry up. The Rainforest Cafe is great too.Free shuttle to and from our hotel taking around 5 mins was excellent.Parades were fab and the fireworks. Everthing is just magical. Everone spoke english and other languages, very helpful.There is a babycentre in each park which is great. Sells jars of food etc with microwave, highchairs, toilets, spoons.Best rides we went on Pirates of the Carribean & Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast (big kids lol).Best shows we seen Moteurs...Action! Stunt show & Buffalo Bills Wild West show. Cant wait to go back!!!",Disneyland_Paris
166589535,2,2013-7,Brazil,"If you really want to go, go.But you should know beforehand:1   there is no respect: people smoke in the entire park, although there are areas designated for that. Peolple smoke in the lines, in the face of children(including yours) with that blas   face. The employees did not see it (there are few, comparing to USA). When they do, they do nothing about it, or just do not care.2   People usually cut line. Yep, it is true( I saw a lot of this complaints here in Tripadvisor) .You have to be paranoid in a vigil to prevent this to happen. The staff do nothing as well.3   There are many (not all of course) rude employees. Very rude.4   it is very disorganized. The fastpass not exist in some attractions, and in others there are only few of them.5 the food is expensive (but this is not what bothers me at most)In summary: It is not Disney. Disney means joy, respect, a place for children and adults that go to the park with good intentions, respecting others and with a good spirit. Is not what happens here.I suggest a few things: the first, and best : save your money and go to the U.S., which is the real Disney (can be Orlando or California). The second: if you live in Europe and can not go to the U.S., but really want to go  Disney , be prepared....Paris is such a wonderful city, so do not waist your time here!",Disneyland_Paris
166585926,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"We were there from 1 5 July and stayed at the Davy Crockett Ranch (excellent) with our grand children 1 & 4 and their parents Good bits: lovely theme park and well laid out, maps available, well stocked souvenir shops, lovely atmosphere, Disney Dreams night spectacular is brilliant and a must see, individual Disney staff very helpful and visible. Turtle Crush, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear, Parachutes, Thunder Mountain and Pirates rides all brilliant! Bad bits: Collectively staff are unorganised and make even the simplest task highly labour intensive, resulting in extreme customer frustration. Car park is a good 15 mins walk away from entrance and even longer if you are a late arrival (although there are travellators), rides frequently had technical issues thus closed but no warning of this until you traipsed all the way to the ride! Fast passes all gone by mid day early afternoon, some rides not as described hyped. TIPS: take advantage of the 8 10am free time prior to park public opening time, but be aware, fast pass for rides does not open until 10am and you cant get refreshments anywhere during this time either!! Don't take hand bags so you can avoid bag check, laborious and pointless, just stick everything into one bag! Don't bother with studio tour it's basically 1 'exciting' stunt during a 10 min train tour and took us 40 mins to queue for. Lightening McQueen is only included for 5mins in the 'Stunt' car show. Food & kids dress up outfits are expensive and the McDonalds was just plain awful. We had lunch with the Disney characters, grandson loved it but restaurant service was painfully slow and disorganised! Get your kids Disney clothes from Asda or Matalan before you go, much cheaper and far better quality! Take a lock for your pushchair. If driving to the attraction, take a route over the top of Paris to avoid their version of the M25!",Disneyland_Paris
166556179,2,2013-7,Singapore,"We went there with our 6year old kid on a Saturday, the 6th July and the experience was a big let down not just because of the long waiting time in queues but also because of the lack of thrills. We only managed to do the Big Thunder mountain, Peter Pans Flight, It's a Small World and Lightyear Lazer Buzz. Big Thunder Mountain was just about ok on the thrill meter, Small World was cute too but nothing much to write home about the rest. We didn't do the Space Mountain due to height restrictions for our child. By the time we finished these rides and a late lunch at a Mexican joint, it was time for the 7pm parade and we were sucked out of energy. The fast pass is a sham, we had 25 min waiting for the LazerBuzz even with a fast pass. I had a ten minute in the queue to collect the fast pass tickets too. The only saving grace was the Mexican lunch. Also buying the 60    premium fast pass doesn't help as fast passes cover only 9 attractions out of 50 odd! You will need a good two days to cover the park and if you are on a very short trip to Paris say three days or lesser just do not bother visiting this place. For someone like me living in Singapore, I would have managed an annual pass to the Universal Studios for the sum I spent here for a day making up for a much better overall experience.",Disneyland_Paris

166506113,3,2013-6,Ireland,"Went with my daughter on Monday 24th June 2013. We were staying in central Paris so got the RER which worked out fine. Had bought the tickets on FNAC website before travelling. Therefore had to call into a FNAC shop prior to travelling to Disneyland to collect the tickets. Thats fine, but what annoyed me was that when we got to Disneyland we then had to queue up again for about 30 minutes to exchange these tickets for other tickets. Mad! Never mind, we got into the Disney mood, bought mini mouse ears and had a fun day. As other reviewers have stated, many of the faster rides were closed that day which was very disappointing as that made the queues for the open rides really long. We got a fast pass but it was not until 4 hours later. I loved the parade and enjoyed watching all the small kids getting excited. I loved the castle and also just wandering around Disney Studios which had lots of atmosphere. We ate lunch at Chalet de la Marionnet where I had very delicious Roast Chicken but the service was woefully slow.Overall I enjoyed the day but there are lots of areas that need major improvement.",Disneyland_Paris
166469674,4,2013-6,Canada,"Disneyland Paris is great if you have kids who want a break from all the museums and art galleries in Paris. You only need one day here. Im an avid Disney Fan who visits Disneyland in Anaheim about 3 times a year and Disneyland Paris does not compare. First off its much smaller so you can easily see everything in one day. Second, the published wait times outside the rides are never correct. Third, the fastpass machines and the rides seemed to be broken more then they were working. And fourthly, smoking is aloud everywhere in the park which is just gross. The employees here don't have the usual Disney work ethic we're used to seeing in the states. But overall we had a good time here. Glad we went but I won't need to go 3 times a year like I do in the states. Spend little time here and instead enjoy all the fun and beauty the city of Paris has to offer.",Disneyland_Paris
166439457,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Me and my son had a great time visiting the two parks. The rides are good and the entire atmosphere really gives a sense of magic. There are however a lot of downsides. Despite the entrance fee, once inside at first impact one may say it's good value for money, but the amount of time spent waiting in line hampers that perception. We were there on a Tuesday, and we struggled with all the queues, I cannot dare to imagine what it must be like on weekends or bank holidays. In addition, some of the rides weren't operating, so we missed on some of the nicest. The parks, both, are filled with merchandise shops and an unbelievable number of food outlets designed to drain whatever cash you might have left in your pocket. Everything is overpriced and especially for the food, the quality leaves you with a lot of doubts. The staff everywhere in the two parks do their best to accommodate the crowd, but let's face it, it must be really challenging having to deal with such a multicultural multitude of guests.We loved the parade, and the closing show is a really nice touch, with lots of fireworks and games of light. Overall it is a fun experience that must be done, at least once.",Disneyland_Paris
166367965,1,2013-7,Australia,"We were so excited to visit Disneyland but it was such a let down. Entering the park was a smooth process but once in the park, this was a nightmare. It was way too crowded and there were people everywhere. 4 of the main rides were closed for maintenance or had technical issues which meant the rides that were open had 1.5 2 hour waits. They let way too many people in especially on a day that not all rides were open. Even the line for food was 1 hour. It was a waste of money and I wouldn't go back.",Disneyland_Paris
166365483,2,2013-7,United States,"Our family of 5, kids ages 9, 12 and 14 spent 5 days in France. We had the idea that Disneyland Paris would be a way to have a kids day and leave the museums for a bit. Maybe even get away from all the smoking in Paris The parks were nice enough and the rides were nice. Space mountain and crushes coaster are very good. Different than the ones in ca and fl. The people working were nowhere near as efficient as I would expect from Disney. We would see trash on the walk ways, people cutting lines, kids playing frisbee near ride entrances and worst of all, smoking everywhere. It almost seemed like Disney was trying to save money and not hire as many people to maintain crowds and keep the place cleanThe smoking pretty much ruined our experience, I asked one employee who was a manager of an area and he told me that even though there are signs for no smoking all over, they just don't enforce it. It's part of the culture he said.I would not go back again",Disneyland_Paris
166357567,3,2013-7,New Zealand,"This was the only Disneyland I hadn't been to so my hopes were high! As it turns out I was a little disappointed. It would have been great if there were more sign posts outside explaining where to go to line up for the different areas e.g. a whole group of us started talking and comparing notes and realized none of us knew which direction to go; some people wanted to buy tickets at the gate, some had purchased them on the internet, some had bought tickets from Paris Tourism and nobody knew what direction to head. In the end we all just followed the long lines of crowds. Inside was fun with the typical rides and fare. Prices very expensive, but as they hold the monopoly on this, then there is not much you can do! The lines were very long and this was even not in the school holidays. Be sure to line up early for the parade. We did so, but unlike other Disneyland parks, the adults just stood up in front of all the kids so the poor kids couldn't see. You could see the disappointed faces of the little kids who had come to the magical kingdom only to see the backs of adults.Overall, it is a pleasant day, but the other Disneylands definitely have it over Disneyland Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
166329486,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"We had a fab time in Disney, but some people that go here have no respect for anyone around them! Smoking, pushing and shoving the whole time! We found some Disney staff to be unhelpful and rides broke down a few times and the womens toilets never seemed to be clean. Also food is expensive, but none of this was a surprise to us and so many reviews had already stated these things. So we were prepared to push and shove back when neccessary, took as much food and drink with us that we could and go with it! And on the whole we loved the experience. We did see lots of characters and if you are patient the characters will wave your child forward as they are obviously watching the pushy parents! It was very busy (more than we had thought it would be as it was out of school holidays) and ques were sometimes long for some rides, but we went to another ride or used the fast pass to avoid queing. We also used the Magic Hours, although was disappointed that the whole park wasn't open. We ate at McDonalds in Disney Village, which was nice and it was lovely to get out of the parks and away from lots of crowds for a while. The shops are nice to look round there as well, although people still don't seem to understand what a que is to pay for things!!! Overall we have come away with great memories and photos and will return, although once our children is old enough we will go back to Florida as it really has the Disney magic there.",Disneyland_Paris
166297347,5,2013-2,United States,"I am from the US and have been to Disneyland and Walt Disney World numerous times. My family and I love all things Disney and Disneyland Paris did not disappoint us! What we loved is that they had several rides like Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, Space Mountain, and Phantom Manor (like Haunted Mansion) that were totally different and way better than the US versions. Their parades and fireworks were way different too, and we absolutely loved them!! So, if you love Disney take the trip to Paris   you will be amazed at this park. It's a lot cheaper than WDW because when you book your Disney Paris hotel it always includes park passes and breakfast for each day. We went in February and were able to get 50% off their normal rates so keep an eye out for their off season discounts and go!!",Disneyland_Paris
166291332,3,2013-6,Germany,"We visited the park with two children (8 and 9 years old). The tickets were included in hotels room price. Both parks are nice and some attractions also suitable for adults. But finally the long waiting time on all stations kills the fun completely. Very expensive prices for beverages and (fast) food are inacceptable, also that a lot of fast food shops closing to early. Really nice is show and fireworks before closing the park. It is recommended to save a good place for viewing very early (one hour before).",Disneyland_Paris

Park open to 11 so we did a few rides on first night. Saw the parade, fireworks   amazing. Rides my 4yr loves, pirates of caribeean, star wars, buzz lightyear. The 6 adults and 2 children all loved 'small world ride'. We went on this ride late in eve as in day its really busy. Didnt see many characters in this park during the holiday, apart from the parades. Did see tigger and eyore here!!",Disneyland_Paris
166239510,5,2013-6,Hong Kong,"It's my first time visiting a Disneyland (though there's one in my home city). I got the internet 20% off offer for one day two park which cost only 59 Euro. I enjoyed watching the Moteurs Action! with fantastic live driving and fighting scene, and cinemagic in the Studio side. For Park side, Space Mountain, Pirates of Carribean and Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast are my favourite thrilling games. I went on a Friday so I didn't queue for over 30 minutes, and it's always clever to get a fastpass if available.Don't miss the firework after the park closing time, though it will be 11pm. It's a special edition for 20th anniversary and lasts for 20 minutes, which made the castle of sleeping beauty a real stage of fantasy.One more thing I wish to highlight is the buffet in Plaza Gardens Restaurant in Main Street. It costs 24 Euro per person, paying 4 Euro more you get unlimited drink. It worths what you pay as there are various kind of salads and cold dishes, main dishes and desserts to enjoy. A buffet with this price and serving ham, pates, mussels, roast pork and cakes is far better than eating burger and chips only, which already cost you 10 Euro.",Disneyland_Paris
166219398,3,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Had a 2 day  2 park ticket and spent one full day in each park with 3 kids, considering the amount of hours we spent in each park (12hours each) there were hardly any characters wondering about, and if we did manage to see one it was mayhem!! Adults who had no kids were outrageously pushing and shoving through children in order to take their picture leaving young children sad because they could not get through these adults.... Smoking is a issue as you had people smoking in the cues with their smoke blowing in children's faces and workers didn't seem to mind, so if you go with children be prepared for this!.... The Women's toilets in both parks (almost every single one) was filthy!! poo in toilets, blood stained tissues left on floors, hairballs and dirt in the hand dryers.... Many Rides kept breaking down and had to be shut for testing, and the rides that were working displayed inaccurate waiting times (if it stated a waiting time of 20mins, Expect to be there for 65mins) while i understand that a lot of people visit the parks so there is bound to be cues, i just feel that in order to stop children and families becoming frustrated in cues they should be a bit more honest with times. With that said... the rides and attractions were Great!! everything is said in French however they do repeat in English which was very handy...All staff speak french but are able to understand English so communication is not a problem. Staff were friendly and happy to help, but be advised the general french Spanish public were Rude and Arrogant!! for some reason they expect their child to go first and are happy to swear at you if they don't, (so expect a lot of parents pushing their child in front of yours)... there are a good amount of places to eat in both parks but is very expensive with a burger, chips & drink costing 15Euros! on site is a place called  Disney Village  home of further expensive food halls and restaurants, However there is a MC DONALDS hidden in the back out of sight which will save you lots (Disney do not advertise this as being in the park). the 20th anniversary parade was good as the children were able to get a glimpse of a handful of characters driving on the floats.. but be warned... arrive at the parade at least 40mins early in order to get a good spot for your child as once again you have Adults pushing their way by themselves pass children in order to get to the front leaving young children faced with nothing but the view of a Backside in front of them (which was quite sad to see as for some of these children this is a once in a life time trip). DO NOT MISS the 23:00 castle show as this is phenomenal and has to be witnessed by all, as i can appreciate this seems late for young children but it will be the highlight of their trip by far!!!",Disneyland_Paris
166218276,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"Enjoyed a recent visit to Disneyland Paris. Visited both parks Walt Disney studios and the Disneyland park. We took my 4 year old daughter who is really into Disney characters including the popular princesses. However my daughter was very disappointed that she could not get to meet snow white or Cinderella. We on,y saw them in passing and they were clearly in a rush. At Disneyland Paris you have to queue for a reservation ticket to see a princess in the princess pavilion. ( you don't know which one it will be until you go in to see them) this means that you could queue up all day long and never get to meet the princess you want. I thought this was not good and Disney should be looking to improve this. At magic kingdom Orlando the princesses frequent the park and the children get to meet all of them. Also there was no shows throughout the day in front of the castle as is in Florida which was amazing and brought all the Disney characters to life. The food and drinks in this park mare astronomical in price so beware how they get away with it I'll never know. Sadly you do not have a choice and when kids want food and drinks you have to spend. Disney apparel was also very expensive a hoodie would cost around 39 euros, raincoat 44 euros and t shirts around 24 euros. Both the Paris parks have many plus points and they are more compact so easier to get around with smaller children and find your bearings. The Disney dream parade was fantastic and the night time closing laser show was superb not to be missed, so clever. Be careful where you stay. I would recommend you stay in one of the partner hotels just outside of resort. We stayed in magic circus and this was very good 4 star. Look for tickets into park on eBay as we saved around   100 in total. Also be careful when you go as if French children off school it will be no pleasure and queues min of around 30  40 minutes for rides. This is not ideal with small children as they become bored easily.",Disneyland_Paris
166177452,4,2013-6,Netherlands,"It is nice to see a multicultural, multilingual Disney in action. Having seen Disney deliver for more than three decades, I understand what makes them connect with people. The light show at Disneyland Paris is fantastic! A must see!The general maintenance in the park would never better tolerated in the US. There is a disconnect in the delivery of the Disney experience here in France   needs to be addressed.In the park, too many simultaneous closings of attractions,restaurants, etc. It is still fun, but Disney must find the magic again here in Paris!",Disneyland_Paris
166114331,3,2013-7,Australia,"Disneyland Paris is easy to get to and the ticketing and entry system was very smooth and easy to understand. Visually, Disneyland Paris is stunning. The gardens, attractions and grounds are kept in pristine condition. The staff around the park were generally very friendly and seem good at communicating despite the many different languages they encountered.On the day we went 2 of the 3 thrill rides were out of action which was disappointing. Our lunch in 'Toad Hall' was a nightmare  avoid this  restaurant  like the plague. There was 4 lines of people with about 4 people in each line and we all had to wait nearly 40 minutes to be served (roughly 10 minutes per customer!). I should add that this is a 'fast food' style restaurant that does little more than chicken burgers and fish & chips. There were ample numbers of staff, they just didn't get any direction or support from their manager.It is a bit frustrating that the minor problems with Disneyland could be easily corrected by making it easy for customers to provide feedback on their experience.",Disneyland_Paris
166090334,2,2013-7,United Kingdom,"Despite glorious weather the visit to the park fell well below the expected standard. The Indiana Jones ride was closed for refurb, Thunder Mountain had a technical problem and never opened, Space Mountain was closed for a short period of time and the Tower of Terror and Peter Pan had a 85 min que as a result ! The fast pass system was not working on some of the rides either. I only saw 1 Disney character in the entire visit who was dismissive of the children that were following. The staff were not very helpful and the best part of the day was Mc Donald's which was good value for money, excellent service but outside the park and not advertised. Not a patch on Florida or LA. don't waste your money   save up and go there instead. Rip off",Disneyland_Paris

Although I have been to Walt Disney World hundreds of times, it was like everything was new. Tomorrowland was astounding. Fantasyland was dreamy, lazy; you'll want to lay down a blanket and look up at the clouds. Pirates of the Caribbean did break down for almost 20 minutes (while we were on it), but we treated it as a photo op. We can't wait to return!",Disneyland_Paris

165940095,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"We arrived Sunday and stayed at the Dream Castle Hotel until the Friday and had a fantastic time! The hotel and staff were fantastic. The room was beautiful and we never had any problems. The only thing I would advise would be not to eat at the hotel as it was very costly but breakfast was fantastic! Everything you could imagine to eat, if possible make mini sandwiches to take with you for the day, as at Disneyland it's just junk food and believe me you really do get sick of it! On our first day at Disneyland we stopped at the first place we found to eat as we hadn't had tea because our flight arrived at 4.30pm, so by the time we got to Disney it was 8.30pm. Our first meal was 3 lots of chips (think McDonalds medium size) 2 hotdogs, 6 chicken nuggets, 3 drinks   42.00!!! I kid you not!!!! The cheapest meals are 'meal deals' and for 3 of us the cheapest worked out just over   32., so be aware! In the hotel, 2 pints and 1 game of pool was   20.00! There are no supermarkets nearby and seeing as we like a nice cup of tea when we woke we just had to find some milk! It took us 2 days to find a mini supermarket in the train station which sold cartooned milk, happy at last! On the first night we asked room service for a glass of milk, it cost   4.00! Lol the only other thing is, if your a vegetarian then I honestly think you will not find much to eat, a friend went recently and hardly ate a thing all week as there are NO vegetarian options at all! Otherwise it was everything we had dreamed of and more!!! Would defo go again!",Disneyland_Paris

165900043,5,2013-6,United Kingdom,As a veteran Disney park fan Paris is our nearest location. Having done all rides before we chilled out and took our time. Use the quieter periods to get on rides eg during parades. Had a lovely hot dog and really enjoyed the fireworks and animation on the castle. Rides for all ages and abilities. Only issue is ost of food and drink and time taken to queue for food was too long. Will be back for more.,Disneyland_Paris
165858836,1,2013-6,United Kingdom,"Where to start??? Firstly as we had an online voucher from Viator (Very well known online tour operator) we were sent to que for thirty minutes to collect tickets from a ticket booth, when we got to the front of the que the very rude operator took our passport details and voucher looked at them for five minutes then told us to go to another que. we then qued for one hour and forty minutes to be told that they couldnt give us our tickets as thier system did not recognise our vouchers. After a good rant and rave we finally got our tickets and entered the park.At first sight the main street of the park is really pretty and it was here we spotted Mary Poppins so we went to have our photograph taken with her, only for her to flinch and move away from us as assume we stood too close to her.We went for some dinner in a cafe on the main street to be charged over 50 Euros for two slices of pizza a cheese toasty, three drinks and a slice of cake. EXTORTION!!With regards to the rides that are open at Disney Paris they are not a patch on Florida and they are very dated. The whole place looks like it needs a revamp and a lick of paint. We even fell asleep in Micheal Jackson's Captain EO ride it was that bad!All in all I would NEVER GO BACK to Disney Land Paris and it astonished me that peoiple can spend a week's holiday there within the disney resort. The staff are incredibly rude, the place needs a giant revamp, they need to have more access to the characters that are meant to walk about, they need to invest money into the park rather than draining the life out of it. Lastly as I said this park is not a patch on Florida, it is very small and outdated and I am in shock that it is owned by Disney let alone being allowed to be run the way it is.",Disneyland_Paris
165837423,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"This was our 6th visit to Disneyland Paris, but our first in Summer (we usually go early December). Although we missed the atmosphere of Christmas, it was still a wonderful trip. The late night firework lazer light show was fantastic, and well worth keeping the little ones up for (it started at 11pm!)   but the second time we watched it, we got there at 9.30 to ensure a decent spot to see it from. The food in the restaurants was lovely, apart from Annette's Diner, where the food was pretty disgusting and the service even worse. I'd highly recommend Cafe Mickey (for the character meal) and Planet Hollywood (where we were pleasantly surprised at the prices).",Disneyland_Paris
165809043,2,2013-6,United States,"Having lived close to the Orlando Lake Buena Vista Disney for a long time, I was expecting something at least somewhat as good. This park is a joke compared to the one in Florida    and most importantly, not worth the money. Three of the rides, Space Mountain, Pinnocchio and Indina Jones (two of which cater to the older crowd) were broken during our visit. The Buzz Lightyear ride stopped twice while we were on it and the Haunted Mansion stopped once, (why do they seem to think it's ok to have rides do that so much?). A lot of the areas seem like they need renovation, paint peeling off etc and they had a Star Wars ride which is fun but seems terribly dated from the 90s (would be better if redone). Oh and get this, the  dumbo  we sat in on the dumbo ride didn't even go up and down! it was broken. I feel like I wasted about 100 euros what with 15euros parking and buying a few refreshments. Yes, I would still bring young kids here, but this place offered nothing interesting for older guests, especially with so many of the rides being broken all at once! I much preferred my experiences in the Asterix theme park (when catering to an older crowd). Disneyland Paris will have to make some serious renovations improvements before I ever consider coming there again.",Disneyland_Paris
165775349,3,2013-2,United Kingdom,"I do like this park very much on the whole, and it looks great, but the rides are mostly behind the other arks in the world (with the exception of big thunder mountain and the rough as hell space mountain).

165748699,4,2013-6,United States,"As a person who has been to Disneyland and Disneyworld multiple times, I was anxious and excited to see what Disneyland Paris had to offer. We bought our tickets through a flash sale on the Carrefour website, thanks google translate. They worked well and we had no problems with them and it saved us about $30 which added to,our souvenir budget. We just did the one day two park as we had a short time in Paris but did not want to miss out on Disney. We mourned by RER from Paris and it was quick and easy. When we arrived we headed to the Walt Disney Studios. I knew the parks would be smaller and not as flashy as the other 2 parks based on my research and that was true for both parks. We tried to,stick with the rides we couldn't do anywhere else and started with Crush's Coaster, which was fun! There are a couple of shows like Animagique and Cinemagique which I would recommend. I did ride Tower of Terror, our bell boy said it was faster than Disneyworld's I don't really no if it is faster but the view of Sleeping Beauty's castle made it the ToT with the best view! Rock n'roller coaster was fine but the pre show just felt disconnected for me. We saw a couple of characters but unlike the US parks there was no cast members to guide guests so it was a push and shove for the kids, no line, luckily we were there at slow time but I would not want to try this during busy time. We moved on to,Disneyland and it was definitely more charming, lots of different things to see. The Jules Verne feel,of tomorrowland was interesting. I loved reliving the submarine ride from Disneyland with Captain Nemo, although here it was a walk through. This is my favorite Space Mountain! Great concept and effects! The thing with Disneyland Parks are the each of the lands are smaller so they are easy to get around and use. I did not have to use 1 fast pass and waited only 20 minutes at the most. I loved being to walk in and up and down around the castle to see the scenes from Sleeping Beauty in stained glass or tapestries, plus the Dragon, that was cool! I really enjoyed the Alice's Curious Labrinyth. Adventureland really only had the Pirates ride I liked, which broke down the first time we were in line. While we there we had 3 rides breakdown, in all my times at Disney I have had it happen only once. DP has more walking around adventures with Pirate ships, caves, Pochoantas Village and suspension bridges, it felt more like an experience and less about the rides. We did the Indiana Jones coaster  (first time broke down). It was simple but it felt more like a mine ride from the Temple of Doom but not as fast. We didn't get to ridge Big Thunder Mountain as it was closed for refurbishment :( but it looked neat and was on an island. What I really love is that The Phantom Manor and Big Thunder Mountain are tied with the same storyline. I really liked Phantom Manor it was just different enough to make it seem special. Overall our trip was good, other than the smoking (even in the park) and the lack of organization with characters it was fun. My husband said it wasn't as magical as DW or DL, we on,y had 2 cast members really go out of their way to be engaging. I was disappointed in the souvenir choices not as much paris tie in as I would have liked. Disney Village was nice and simple, loved Earl of Sandwich of course. I liked the feel of it better than DL but not as much as DW. Overall glad I went but still on fence if I would go again, maybe if I stayed on property and went the same time, because it was slow.",Disneyland_Paris
165745877,1,2013-6,Canada,"Please tell me this place isn't owned and operated by the walt disney company!! After having been a disney world annual passholder for numerous years, we decided to try out a foreign disney property on our recent trip to Europe. We were so disappointed. Major rides were down for maintenance, in what I am assuming, being summer, is prime time. Other rides were regularly  temporarily paused . We would be in a long queue, only to have the ride break down, forcing us to leave . Numerous restaurants were not open, whilst there were lines into the streets for the ones that were. Not nearly enough washrooms, most always a queue, and not looked after. For an amusement park, it would be ok...but to have the Disney name attached to it....not so much. Definitely the low point of our vacation.",Disneyland_Paris
165744363,3,2013-6,United Kingdom,"Went to Disneyland Paris in June 2013. After already visiting Orlando and Anaheim, the Paris location was rather disappointing. The entrance to Disneyland, the Studios and the Village are all together and the baggage checks mean that all visitors go through the same area. This delays getting in and if the weather isn't good, this is not good. The park was good but we found the staff not very helpful and it didn't seem as well organised as we would expect at a Disney facility. Often at rides there were 6 or 7 attendants but only 1 or 2 were guiding visitors onto the rides, the others seemed to just be standing around. As an example, at the backlot tour there were 9 members of staff at the trams but only 1 went down shutting and checking all the doors while the others just stood. This caused quite frustrating delays between passengers getting on and the tram departing.Food was VERY expensive. A standard packet of crisps were 2.50 euros. Disney isn't cheap anywhere but this was worse. Added to that, we decided to have pizza in the park but both pizza places were closed (no signage just doors locked. 3rd choice was fish & chips but Mr Toad's was also closed. I never went to the toilets but my wife and daughter were far from impressed. They were smelly and dirty. Not what you would expect from Disney (again). All in all, it was good for my daughter and in Europe there's not much other option but it's not cheap and certainly not up to usual Disney standards.",Disneyland_Paris
165741844,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"An awesome experience for our 25 wedding anniversary. The Disney Dreams show was spectacular and truly magical, as was the Disney Anniversary Parade. There is a mixture of things to do for all age groups, including us over 40's, space mountain was our favorite but if we had not used our fast pass we would have been in the queue for hours!. An abundance of shops to visit but not cheap if you have children in tow.Disney itself is spotless with many park employees there to clear up the slightest bit of rubbish. However, the public toilets were another story. Without exception these were all smelly, dirty and extremely unpleasant to use. What a shame that so much money is spent keeping the park looking so nice bu the 'out of sight' areas are left in such a state.",Disneyland_Paris
165735726,4,2013-5,Australia,"After reading a lot of mixed reviews on Disneyland Paris, I was prepared for a poor second cousin to the US parks. As the title says, we were pleasantly surprised and found it a very beautiful park. Whilst we noticed a few standards slipping compared to the US and Japanese parks, it was nowhere near as noticeable as we had been led to believe. All but one CM was friendly and helpful and we didn't experience the queue jumping or smoking in lines that others complain of. Food is more expensive than elsewhere in Paris but this is the case in every Disney park and we generally only ate one meal there or in Disney Village.We were there during a very quiet week and had walk ons to almost all attractions with no need to use Fast Passes. There are several rides slightly different to the US parks and some completely new ones. We especially loved all the walk through attractions which are unique to DLP like the Taniere du Dragon (every castle should have her), Alice's Curious Labyrinth and Les Mysteres du Nautilus. Adventure Isle was lots of fun to explore. The park is well spread out with lots of room. The parade was excellent and the 20th celebration Dreams Show was spectacular and one of the best I have seen at a Disney anywhere. If you enjoy the US parks then I would be surprised why you wouldn't enjoy DLP.",Disneyland_Paris
165639084,3,2012-8,Morocco,"First, we had a great three day visit at Disney. The kids will always love it. However, it was my first time in a Disney overseas and I was really surprised that they don't maintain the famous Disney quality. The buildings had paint peeling, the bathrooms were atrocious. trash was all over the grass and walkways and the service was rude. There is no way this would be tolerated in an American Disney resort. It takes away from the magic of the place to see things so dirty and to encounter so many surly  cast members . That said, the rides are fun and there are the old favorites plus some new fun ones. We would go back, but I think Walt would turn over in his grave to see how they have let his standards slip.",Disneyland_Paris
165633736,5,2013-6,United Kingdom,"The day didn   t start too great but it improved to turn out to be another fantastic time at EuroDisney. We were not impressed when we first arrived since the first two rides we dashed to, Thunder Mountain and the Pirates of the Caribbean were closed due to technical difficulties. Now it   s true nothing much has changed in this park since it first opened in 92 but the old adage of:    If it   s not broken, why fix it    for somewhere like Disney would normally ring true. That said if things are becoming tired and worn I feel the park should be doing more to update things to avoid this. The park does have a maintenance  refurbishment schedule which they advertise in advance so we were expecting that Space Mountain and Dumbo were closed. This is our third visit to the park and unless Disney adds  makes significant changes we are quite happy, including our children, to say we are now done with visiting here.The park price is always a common grumble but you should consider that since the park opened it has never made any profit and in facts operates at a loss. This made us feel that yes it is still expensive but we are not getting ripped off in the name of someone making heaps of money on the back of it. It actually worked out cheaper for us to buy two single day passed for the two days we visited over their multi day park tickets. We drove here ourselves. It was easy to park but cost 15 Euros. It appears that Disneyland do listen to feedback as previously the pushing and shoving of adults in front of the characters was really hellish. On our visit this year however it was very civilised and staff actually took control. The system now is that you line your children in a circle around the character and it will be they who chose who will be next to meet them! Pushing and shoving will actually get you nowhere and if fact it may even get you a wagging finger from Mickey or Minnie (or whoever you are wishing to see) and they will not pick you to come and say Hi. This was so much better and our children got to meet far more characters without the upset of being knocked out the way like previous visits. It also appeared there were more characters out and about in this park then in previous years. Well done Team Disney. The princess pavilion has changed too and works on a reservation system I believe. The    extended    20th celebration is obviously a money saving exercise but you cannot blame them. When you see the money invested into the Disney Dreams light show you can appreciate why they have extended this. We were so happy to see this again and it was more magical than the first time. The only annoying thing is that they start to close down the food and drink stalls at the time of the light show so you end up queuing for 30 minutes just to get a bottle of water.The fast past system is not perfect but it is still probably the best system in the world and allowed us to ensure we did everything in the park we could do. Obviously the technical problems of some of the rides has a knock on effect meaning tickets can run out. Astute parents with older kids will time the most popular rides with the parades to guarantee the shortest queuing times. Day 2 of the park was mostly spent in the Studios park. That closes at 5 so we headed back here but Disney had to close the park about 7. I cannot blame them, lighting struck right in front of us! I had never seen lighting so close before that it hits the floor in front of you! Very scary. It wasn't safe for anyone to be outside so when there was a break in the storm, they closed the park so people could leave. It was the right choice and no one was injured apart from the two chavs who decided to have a punch up just outside the main gate for some reason? Thankfully our children only saw the blood everywhere and no violence but we were reassured to see Disney had a swift security response.",Disneyland_Paris
165601629,1,2013-6,United States,"If you love Disneyland? Skip Disneyland Paris, because you will be disappointed! First there are very few rides, half of the restaurants were closed, you have to wait in line to make a reservation to meet a princess, then come back and wait for your reservation! They let people smoke in the park, people cut in line and the people who work there don't care! The service sucks, the employees are rude, and act like they hate their jobs! The park is dirty, the restrooms are small, AND dirty, there are very few garbage cans, and no benches to sit on, rides were closed or broke down often, and you can't get any information from anyone, because they just don't care. It was the worst Disney experience I have ever had!",Disneyland_Paris
165581914,5,2013-6,Belgium,"Unless if you are a hardcore rollercoaster fan, Disneyland definitely worth the trip. The park ows some childish ride but also has some more sensational rollercoaster   ride (Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, ...). Besides of that some rides attractions bring you back to your childhood !The drawback of Disneyland is the price of everything. Book you entrance ticket online 5 days before your arrival and pay  only  46    (instead of 62   !!). Bring also your food because a basic hamburger is 8   ! Everything is expensive, so be prepared !The park can require the full day. No need to buy a two park one day ticket.",Disneyland_Paris

165554581,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"We really enjoyed our trips into the park.   It's worth going in early (8am) if you're staying at a Disney hotel to do some of the (mostly Fantasy Land) ride.  The Disney Dreams show is well worth staying for but it doesn't seem to start on time (started around 23:10) which seems very late for the mostly young audience.  There are more shops than rides! Mostly selling the same, overpriced, stuff.  The rides: We asked on the first day which rides we could take our 9 month old and were given a list. We quickly found out very very few rides will actually admit a baby under 1. That said after watching the rides (Dumbo, Peter Pan, Buzz Lightyear to name a few) we knew our daughter would be fine and said she was a year to get through the barriers. She loved it and was perfectly safe. There is the baby swap facility but we didn't bother with it.  Fast pass is useful for busy rides.  Eating in the park: We ate in the Bake Shop which was mediocre and tried the Blue Lagoon which was dire (see review). Popcorn and sugar sweets are readily available but chocolate not so much.",Disneyland_Paris

165438786,3,2013-6,United States,"I've been to all 3 Disney Parks    Florida, California, and now France. This was my least favorite. Some of the really fun rides for kids   Mr. Toad's Wild Ride and Alice In Wonderland are walk through attractions rather than actual rides at this park. However, Pirates of The Caribbean was amazing, possibly better than the other parks. As I read elsewhere, indeed the bathrooms were quite smelly compared to other parks I've visited and this was the only park where visitors have to be reminded not to smoke on the rides (I actually just found this humorous). In this  non smoking park , the designated smoking areas were completely empty because people smoke wherever they want to, so if you are horrified by smoking, you'll probably need to get over it before you ever come to Europe. One of the biggest improvements over the USA parks    the beverage selection    beer and wine are served at some restaurants. Overall, the Disney magic is still here and I don't want to be too critical because I love Disneyland and my niece had a lovely time, but I can't help compare my experiences with the other Disneyland parks and for me this left a little bit to be desired.",Disneyland_Paris

We were about to end up in hospital after we bought some doughnuts and ...they were mouldy....they were selling them after the expiry date :((I don't want to imagine what could have happened if my son would had eaten those doughnuts!!!!How is possible that such a big resort is selling expired food? I am sure they have people who check the food , and everybody nowadays , who serve or sell food have to have Food and Hygiene course where you study how to store food, to check the temperature, check the expiry date, etc.However, the guest services gave us a refund , but when they called the owner of the shop who sold the doughnuts, he apologised, but he stole the doughnuts,he thought that we are going to make a big fuss about it and that was the evidence.My son could end up with food poisoning and really ill!!!Very scary and disappointing.

165329633,5,2013-6,United States,"There are plenty of reviews about the Park in general so I don't need to comment much on that.I wanted to add some thoughts though for parents with kids with disabilities development needs as I have been very pleased with the experience.Every child deserves to be a princess, a space ranger or just feel special at Disneyland, but I am very pleased that the Park goes the extra mile to ensure a great experience for kids with disabilities or certified development needs.We produced a medical certificate to the guest office at the entrance of the park (I asked and I was informed in advance and I think this is reasonable to prevent any abuse). We were handed a special disability pass that allowed my daughter with Down Syndrome and 3 family members to get special access.That pass allowed us to avoid lengthy lines and enter through the disabled entrance and seat in reserved seating for shows and parades. Even the restaurants have a disable line.This is not only to make the park more accessible and limit the wait for fragile kids whose learning disabilities make them less tolerable to wait in lines (which in turns makes the other customer crankier at your kids...), but it is also done with safety in mind. The kids with disabilities were seated in special marked boats so that if the attraction should fail they had a map of where special emergency escape arrangements may need to be made. By the way, this means that in some attractions you may have to wait a bit for the  right  boat to come by and may end up waiting more than a short line in the regular access.My daughter got to take pictures with 9 princesses over 3 days and she felt specially greeted every time, she loved every minute. And big brother felt special that his different little sister granted him possibly a nicer visit.Well done Disney!",Disneyland_Paris
165312797,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"Visited Euro Disney for the first time a few weeks ago. Having been to Disney in Orlando I was a little sceptical as I found that to be very child focused (although with a few decent rides). What a surprise! They seem to have taken the best bits from the 3 Orlando parks (I don't include EPCOT as, quite frankly, nobody should ever go there, ever, ever, ever) and condensed them into two parks next door to each other. Space Mountain is far better than the Orlando version. Rock n' Roller Coaster is excellent (if it does lose some momentum towards the end of the ride). Crush's Coaster is absolutely fantastic and well worth the lengthy queue. If you like your rides more gentle (why?!!) then there is plenty to do, such as Big Thunder Mountain and the infamous Pirates of the Caribbean. All of this is enhanced by Disney   s brilliant fast pass system which allows you to skip most of the queues and, uniquely to Disney, is free.All in all, I would strongly recommend. It is worth two days to ensure you cover everything.",Disneyland_Paris
165230913,4,2013-6,Australia,We had a wonderful time at Disneyland. Favourite kids rides were the dumbo ride and the buzz light year ride. Favourite adults ride was the thunder mountain! Amazing fun even with a 9 year old screaming and crying the whole way. Food all grose bring your own. Come in a princess dress or you may feel out of place. Great rides. Great access from Disneyland hotel. Able to go back and forth at leisure. See the parade it was fabulous! Get some big mickey hands and some ears!!!,Disneyland_Paris

Even though only 1 ride was advertised as being closed while we were there (Magic Mountain), during our 3 days, we experienced closures at all the major attractions  Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean and the Tower of Terror. Many of the restaurants and kiosks were also closed. Staff exuded irritation and seemed uninterested in doing their job. Bathrooms were dirty and flowerbeds and landscaping in shambles. I would not recommend this park to anyone.",Disneyland_Paris

165140789,5,2013-6,Finland,"We spent a day at Disneyland Paris with our 8 year old. Booked tickets in advance which is worth while. Baught the one day, two parks ticket, but never gor to Walt Disney studios... Hence the advice to plan you visit in this attraction. The park is huge and cues are long, you can get fastpasses, but think which rides you want to experience, because you can also have only one fastpass at a time. Food was basic and expensive. Next time around I will bring sandwhiches and drinks along. There are lots of different boutiques and shops that sell everything Disney related. Part of the fun was to choose which items to buy. Again, the prices are high, but we gave our daughter a budget and she was very exited about choosing the things that she the bought.Prepare you visit so that you can stay until the final show. We flied in on the same day as we spent at this attraction and were so tired at 9pm that had to skip the show. A shame.",Disneyland_Paris

165079815,4,2013-5,United Kingdom,"We went for a family trip to Disneyland Paris in May with 3 young kids. We didn't stay in a Disney Hotel, but that didn't seem to hamper us too much as most local hotels seem to have a free shuttle to the park.The park itself was great for the kids who loved the Disney characters. The rides were average, similar to attractions such as Chessington, Gullivers, Thorpe Park etc but with the Disney theme. There are two parks Disneyland Park and Disney Studios. We found Disney Studios to be less busy. Both parks have a parade which is well worth it. This is most unique event of the parks and done very well.Queue's throughout the day were about 40 min to 1 hour for the more popular rides. We used the fast pass on a number of rides which was a great way to be ahead of the queues. Definitely worth going early and collecting fast passes for a number of rides (fast passes tend to finish by about midday). Having the fast passes allowed us to plan the day better as we had specific timeslots for the popular rides. Fast passes are free. Disney Studios also allows for a shorter queue for single riders, so if you don't mind not sitting on the same row on the ride, you can beat the ques. This worked really well when me and my 11 year old daughter went on three key rides within 1 hour.Disneyland park has a specific attraction called Meet Mickey, which we felt was  a must  given we were in Disneyland. This was a huge disappointment, where after queuing for an hour we only got about 1 minute to take some pictures with a Mickey character. Disney Studios park has a much better attraction with much smaller queues where you can meet Mickey, Minnie,. Pluto all at the same time.Food at the parks is pretty basic, i.e burgers and chips is pretty much the range. For Vegetarians, they do offer a pretty good salad though. So if you are a vegetarian or only eat halal kosher meat, then it would be better to bring a packed lunch. We travelled to the park from the UK via Eurostar which was superb. We found that we lived close to Ebsfleet International which was much better than travelling into London for St Pancras International. Ebsfleet has a large car park close to the station, so parking and getting to the station is very easy, even with 3 kids in tow: )",Disneyland_Paris
165078354,5,2013-6,United Kingdom,A fantastic energetic day in the park. Time flew advised to be in the park from opening till close (10 23) advised to do all attractions but realised had to make appointment to see Disney princesses as not many characters are about the park. Set meal are reasonable price in the cafe's although alacart menus are more expensive. Queuing times can take 1.30 hours but can be cut shorter with the fast pass tickets.

165036240,5,2013-6,United Kingdom,"We stayed in Disneyland Paris for 4 nights early June and what an experience, no it's cheap but well worth the money. We stayed in the Newport bay hotel which was superb from the moment we booked in, only 3 4minutes walk from the village and an extra couple of minutes to the park itself, the buffet breakfast was great and the staff had no problems letting us take baguettes, cold meats and cheese away with us to see us through lunch. Two disney characters did photo calls every morning. The mickey cafe in the village is a must for breakfast one and a half hours of American breakfast with mickey, Minnie, goofy, Pluto, chip dale, tigger and more, heaven for the kids. The park itself is disney just what you would expect and more, characters, parades, kiddies rides and shows plus a few white knuckle moments for the adults as well. The closing ceremony at 11.00pm is worth every penny you spent on the holiday itself, magnificent, magnificent.

This year, it is celebrating its 20th year, so we wanted to give the park another chance. This time the park seemed cleaner and in better repair. It was open longer hours this as well. The one BIG suggestion we would like to pass on to the trip advisor community is this: If you are staying in Paris and just going to Disney for one day, then instead of riding the RER or a bus   both of which will take from 40 90 minutes with HOARDS of other people   spend 17 euros a person instead and ride the  bullet train  TGV instead. IT TAKES ONLY EIGHT MINUTES!! That seems impossible, but it's true!! It was quick, quiet, clean and a GODSEND at the end of a very tiring day at the parks. You can book your tickets online and pick them up at the station when you arrive. Now a suggestion for the TGV folks   make the last train of the evening run about 40 minutes later than it currently does so your customers can stay and see the fireworks at the end of the evening.

There were plenty of rides that we could all go on, including the 1 year old, & some 'white knuckle' ones for the adults. The Buzz Lightyear ride was a winner for all ages & resulted in a competition between my husband & brother to see if either of them could get 999,999 points (400,000 was the highest one of them managed!). As we went mid week & in term time the queues were really good, just the Friday where we had to wait longer. The length of time we had there was just right with young children as we didn't have to rush anywhere. Food & drink is expensive but we did half board & upgraded a coup,e of meals whilst there. Whilst grandparents babysat one evening, my husband & I went for a meal at Blue Lagoon & really enjoyed the atmosphere & food there. We stayed at Sequoia Lodge, which was in a very peaceful location & a 15 minute walk to the heart of the Disney Park. The rooms were a good size, comfortable beds & clean. We had four rooms altogether & they put us right next to each other with interlocking doors between 2 rooms. With 2 double beds in the family room it meant we could have the 3 year old in with grandparents & 1year old in cot with us, but easy access with the doors. We were 'shipped' out for breakfast in the mornings but this worked well as it made us go to the park early & most days the children were up early anyway. The continental buffet breakfasts were good & Plaza Gardens Restaurant was a very pleasant place to have it. Both the main park & studio park were great & had a relaxed atmosphere. There are a lot of shops, which can lead to a few tantrums from children as,  you don't buy me everything I see & want! . I really recommend Ezyshuttle for the transfers. We saw them on a forum & easily booked them. They were waiting at arrivals, with a sign, had a comfortable vehicle, car seat for the children were provided & it cost    70 each way for 6 individuals. They were very professional, friendly & flexible.

We are three men going for a fun day out so whatever people say it's NOT just for kids its for everyone had a great laugh I would advise to take a packed lunch we each tuck sandwiches,small drinks, crisp,biscuits ect put them in a separate bag all together so if your bag gets searched at the gate which it will do just say we are taking the bag to guest services. Guest services will look after your bag all day for    3. Once you get past the bag checking stage then it's upto you just go straight through into the park with your lunch bag and just sit in the park on a bench or grassed area and eat your sandwiches we just sat in a little area before we entered the main gates to the park in front of the big Mickey mouse clock to the left there's an under cover bit but yeah you can just take your sandwiches packed lunch in so don't worry. But remember if they say when your getting your bag checked your not allowed these in just say we are keeping them at guest services but you won't have a problem there just looking for big picnic biscuits,alcohol,knifes,guns, ect. Anyway once your in the park pick up yourself a park guide just and plan your day out. Some of the ride queues were a little big but you can get a fast pass but also just wait which doesn't take long little bit of advice best to ride the popular rides first ie big thunder mountain space mountain,Indian Jones ect try and do them when the parade is on cos it goes quite then. Take an empty water bottle with you there is water points around the park to fill up. There should be a few vegetarian options there tho had a look at some of the menus there and all there is is a salad so best taking your own food. Our fav rides are big thunder mountain, tower of terror,Indiana Jones, space mountain, crushes coaster, Armageddon ride. All the rides were good also at night its good to check out the castle light show which is amazing. Second day went to Disney studios park you could do that in a few hours Cos it isn't as big as the Disneyland side. But it's good to stroll around it and chill great parade there to called stars and cars. The staff around the park are friendly and available to answer any questions. Hope my advice helps have a good time",Disneyland_Paris
164466437,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,Been to WDW in Florida many times and never really though of going to DL Paris until now.  Was well impressed with the place. Some of the attractions even surpassed WDW!  Will definitely be returning,Disneyland_Paris

164399887,1,2013-6,United States,"Dirty, peeling paint, people smoking everywhere, expensive and long queues of people. I have visited every Disney park in the world and Disneyland Paris is significantly below the standards that Disney has established at all the other parks. Normally when I leave a Disney park I feel I have paid a lot of money but the value of enjoyment I have received exceeded the amount I paid. That is definitely NOT the situation with Disneyland Paris...high prices and low value.The staff are not friendly nor helpful. We had an issue with transportation arranged through Disney. They did not send the transportation vouchers to me. Although I had a paid receipt, they could not print the vouchers and told me I would need to call the central reservations line (apparently customer service does not include the concierge making the call). Of course this happened on a Sunday and the central reservations office was closed.Regarding the smoking, there are designated smoking areas indicated on the map. The guests just choose to ignore them and the staff do not inforce it.Possibly Disneyland is the only alternative in Europe. But if possible, I would suggest finding something cheaper and where the staff is trained in customer service. Otherwise, you should pay to go to Orlando and have an enjoyable holiday.",Disneyland_Paris
164381904,5,2012-9,South Africa,"The Fagan4 of South Africa are celebrating today (18 June 2013)   today a year ago we paid for our trip to Disneyland Paris and it was the day we started out countdown to the holiday   106 days. I'll never forget it. Even though the holiday was 365 106 days ago : ) we still have lots of fantastic memories and we look forward to going back again. In fact, we had lunch at the nearby Lanseria Airport a while ago and I burst into tears when an airplane took off   how corny is that!!! We stayed at the 2* Santa Fe hotel and it had everything we needed   bed, bath and a big breakfast. The rest of the time we spent in the park. We were there from early and got back to the hotel late. The bus to and from the park and hotel was on time (in SA, anything being on time is a thumbs up). We had coffee at McDonalds every morning (sorry DLP, SA's coffee and wine is soooo much nicer), lunch in the park and supper at the disney village. We have 2 active preteen boys so hubby and I stuffed our faces at breakfast every morning, I made ham and cheese croissants for the boys for their 'snacktime' then during lunch, the boys had the adult meals and hubby and I had the kiddies meal (the kiddies kept the toys that came with most kiddie meals....). Supper was a burger, chicken nuggets or lasanya from the hundreds of restaurants. Ample water fountains in the park was great cos mommies always end up carrying water juice bottles. I miss that place so much. I wouldn't change a thing about it. DLP and Santa Fe will definitely see the Fagans again. Xxx",Disneyland_Paris
164375892,3,2013-6,United Kingdom,"My wife and I went last week and planned to spend a whole day at the park and wait until the fireworks show at 23:00, but it was so quiet that we managed to get on all the rides we wanted, see the entire park and fit in a beer, before we got bored and decided to leave at around 17:00...We don't have children, but I have my wife (like a child when it comes to Walt Disney) so she enjoyed it, but for me it isn't worth the 50 Euros.Tips:1) Take your own lunch2) Go mid week as it seems quieter. We went in June and it was perfect weather3) Happy hour in Arthurs Pub in the village is from 17:00   18:00, making beer a reasonable price4) Obvious, but wear comfy shoes and clothes5) Some French don't believe in politely queueing, so stand your ground",Disneyland_Paris

164193715,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Having been told that Paris is nothing like the US parks for friendliness, I have to say the staff were great and if you research the features of this park, its version of some of the rides are better than the US parks.Naturally be ready for queues. The fastpass can help a bit, but the magic hours   obtained by staying in the Disney hotels provide the best advantage. Disney Dreams (which probably ends soon) is worth going to see but shows half an hour before closing, which can mean a late night (it requires darkness).Top rides with small children   Pirates of the Caribbean, Buzz Lighyear, Peter Pans Ride, Dumbo, Its a Small World, Autopia",Disneyland_Paris
164191752,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We had a fantastic couple of days exploring the park. Fantasy land was definitely my daughters highlight (4years old). That and the buzz ride, which we went on multiple times)! We had fantastic weather which would have helped. Fast pass was a delight but wasn't offered for all rides. Had to wait 20minutes at least for most things. Which can be tiring with a 4 year old. We didn't wait at the princess pavilion (45minute) but opted for dinner with the princesses which was amazing and worth every penny! We got to see 3 princesses without having to hang around waiting. Our only grumble was our wait for lunch  45minutes, plus a lack of tables : (Recommend going to the village for food to avoid this. Great couple of days, clean park, friendly staff and great atmosphere. Love it!",Disneyland_Paris
164141869,5,2013-6,India,"I'm a 32 year old father of one who still gets wildly excited every time a Pixar movie is up for release. I've grown up with the characters of Toy Story and Finding Nemo and have passed on some of that enthusiasm to my six year old son. Having never been to a Disneyland before, both of us were wild eyed and super excited for this one. Unfortunately, we chose a cold, wet day, a day when even the Seine over flowed and disrupted traffic in Paris. So the Disneyland shuttle that we had booked arrived 45 minutes late, eating into our time at the park. We opted for Disneyland's own Shuttle service available on their website. It has stops at four major and convenient locations of Paris.You would have to walk a fair distance from the Bus stop to reach the park gates. Keep this in mind while returning in the evening if you have to be on time to catch the shuttle back. You would be very tired and this long distance seems even longer on weary legs. In the morning, we were through the turnstiles with our e tickets in no time as the crowds seemed thin. On our left was the Walt Disney Studio Park and on our right the Main Disneyland Park. We did the studio park in the first half of the day and then proceeded to Disneyland Park.The park is split in 5 different zones named Adventure Land, Fantasy Land etc. The overall theme is classic Disney and less of Pixar. So lot more rides themed on Snow White, Cinderella etc along with classic rides like the Carousel and Cup & Saucer. Queues seemed shorter here than the Walt Disney Studio Park and this park generally catered to younger kids more than the adults.One great experience was the Character Parade in the evening. Some fine Disney music along with a plethora of Disney characters being paraded made for a magical fifteen minutes. My son couldn't have enough and his expression was priceless when he shook hands with Capt. Jack Sparrow. Overall, Disneyland delivered on all the magic it promises.",Disneyland_Paris

The toilet was slippery and unkept, we ate at one of the all you can eat restaurant I forgot the name, it was generic. Maybe better restaurant? But we had great time overall. We brought our 80 year old granny and it was no problem to rent a wheelchair and pushed it around a all, not many stairs, at least we can find ways without many stairs, so it was fun when everybody can join in.",Disneyland_Paris

164016994,3,2013-6,Bolivia,"What can we say? Euro Disney could also be called Euro Business, because that is what is all about. For every theme attraction there are 5 or 6 shops selling toys and accessories related to the Disney characters. So powerful is Mickey Mouse that he has managed to extend copyright from 50 to 75 years, so business can continue. What you get is exactly what you get in Orlando and the fact that this is Europe doesn   t seem to count at all. Wouldn   t it be nice to have a theme park inspired in so many wonderful characters from children   s stories that have been created in Europe?",Disneyland_Paris
164001604,3,2013-6,United Kingdom,"We have been to Disney three times now and each time it is great watching the kids faces.It is a wonderful place which allows you to be 8 years old all over again! So what are the punches you need to roll with? It is well documented that things are expensive, but year on year the increase has really over shot the mark of reasonable and some rides I am sure have got less in terms of their duration. Our co visitors seem to have become less and less pleasant.I appreciate that we in the UK may possibly be a bit prickly and prim about queuing, and just general good manners, or the  correct  way of doing things; but the visitors over the years have become marauding wildebeest. The shoving, queue jumping and the disregarding of children other than their own, is appalling. It starts off as eye brow raising, but really wears thin after the second day. Just keep this mind, like I said roll with the punches and try to not be too affected and enjoy the fun! Top tip   make sure you see the Disney show at 11pm perhaps a little too late for our younger visitors....it really is fantastic, but be aware they close all toilets an hour before the show starts until it finishes....so if you have somehow managed to keep our younger visitors awake for this extravaganza.......",Disneyland_Paris
163992454,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,This is my third visit to this park and I enjoyed it even better this time as the kids are a good age for it (4 and 16 months) they had a fab time. I was a little disappointed that both the Dumbo ride and Big Thunder Mountain rides were shut and there was no note on the park guides. We found the same with one of the restaurants. If its closed it should be marked as so on the park guides!,Disneyland_Paris
163984259,1,2013-6,United Kingdom,"We travelled by Eurotunnel....brilliant there in 20 minutes, can't fault it! Only good part of the whole experience!!We booked 4 nights at Sequoia Lodge and came home after 3, we had had enough. The hotel itself was OK, a bit tired in need of refurbishment. Two double beds, unable to get a family room or a room with 1 double and 2 singles. Very basic, no coffee tea making facilities. Just two beds, TV, wardrobe and bathroom, very smelly hallways.We booked bed and breakfast, we arrived early for check in 11.45am on day 1, by which time all the breakfast passes for the hotel other than 7.15 had gone so we were forced to trek to Disneyland Park for breakfast at 9.15. First day was at Plaza Gardens, great no probs shown to a table, continental brekky, no long queues, day 2 at Au Chalet de la Marionette, not seated, queue for brekky, then queued for 25 mins for a table then 20 mins for a coffee absolute nightmare. Not ideal that you can't get breakfast in the hotel that you have paid for!The fast pass in DP Parks works on a one at a time basis, e.g. if you get a fast pass for Peter Pans flight with a time of 16.30 and it's only 10.00am you cannot get another fast pass until that one has been used so choose carefully. The queues were on average about 45 minutes for most rides.The Characters are a complete let down, they were down right rude! We had 2 children both with an autograph book both desperate for autographs and photos, they got 1 autograph between them and not a single photo. The character Suzy pushed them out of the way and Wendy from Peter Pan was asked by another parent where the queue started as she was having the same problems with trying to get photos and autographs and was told 'there is no queue, we choose who we want to be photographed with and who's book we want to sign'. Complete and utter waste of time even trying to get an autograph.Food and drinks in the park mega expensive, toffee apple 3.50, candyfloss 4.00, coffee 4.00, burger   hot dog, fries and drink 14.00. Eat at the Disney Village, their is a McDonalds offering the same but go large for 6.90. Also Ludwigs Castle is a bar in the Village and they do a happy hour from 17.00 to 19.30 half price everything. Drinks in hotel Bar 7.00 for a beer, 4.00 for a coke.Overall they have managed to turn Disney magic into just a theme park in France. This wasn't our first trip but will definitely be our last.Advice...save and go to Orlando Florida, it is the complete opposite to Paris where you do feel the magic!",Disneyland_Paris
163956625,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,Would come back again and again.  Even though it was freezing we enjoyed loads.  Did check before we left and the park had 8 rides shut so we were prepared for that.  Check before you go.,Disneyland_Paris
163841590,2,2013-5,United Kingdom,We have been to Disneyland Paris 5 times with our children and usually love it but I have to say that this was definitely the last time! Half the rides were closed and the prices had gone up so much since last year it wasn't even funny. It was roughly   16 for burger and chips a small bottle of water was   4! If you are a family you spend an absolute fortune. We stayed in the Hotel Cheyenne and we had to move rooms 3 times! Firstly the first room they gave us was the wrong one and we couldn't gain entry with the key card and we had unpacked the car and had all the luggage with us. They then moved us to a completely different block which took us ages with all the cases and bags and two children only to find that the second room they put us in already had people in it. We entered the room to find handbags passports and money on the bed it was most uncomfortable so yet again we had to go back to reception only to be moved back to the first block but a different room and they didn't even offer to help with the luggage   we were so annoyed. We were so stressed before we even got to the park with the children. Never again if you have children don't do it but if its a stag or hen weekend its ideal. We are absolutely gutted how bad it was because in the past we have enjoyed it so much.,Disneyland_Paris
163810798,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"We stayed at Disneyland for 4 nights and found we had plenty of time to get round all the park and Walt Disney Studios. We went on all the rides we planned on going on except 2   the train as after waiting 30 minutes there was a technical fault and Big Thunder Mountain as it was closed for repair. The park itself was always very clean and tidy and found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The longest we queued for a ride was 45 minutes which i find very acceptable, although on the Saturday, our last day, it was very busy and queue times were over an hour for everything. If you are staying on the park definitely make use of the magic hours 8 10 as you hardly queue at all.The characters were all great, tried there best to get round everyone for photos and autographs without rushing through which made the children feel special.The Dreams show was absolutely magical and we really enjoyed the parades too.There are plenty of places to eat and drink and we found them all reasonably priced. Can't fault anything and looking forward to going back again.",Disneyland_Paris

163776476,3,2013-6,Canada,"Our disappointment may have come from comparing this park to the one in California, but Disney has a standard that simply was not met here. Things we liked about the park: It is very close to trains and transport.The castle is beautiful and the walkthrough is great.The staff were all very friendly and spoke English.Crush's Coaster, Rockin' Rollercoaster and some of the live shows are worth experiencing.Cons: The park is dirty, with some attractions having several millimetres of visible dust, spiderwebs, gum on the ground and cigarette butts. Leading to...Smoking. Nothing ruins the magic (and my asthma) like people blowing smoke and flicking ash on you, which happens EVERYWHERE in the park. It's obnoxious, rude, selfish and probably the worst park of the park for me.Very few rides. California may be older, but has had to deal with squeezing new rides where old ones were, reusing old parking lots and otherwise making the most of not so much space. Paris had the privilege of all the space they needed, yet so much is missing in comparison to the West Coast resort.Poor navigation   everything leads to a dead end and doesn't loop as it should, especially in the western half of the park.The guests   although I know that European people are less  please & thank you  than many of their New World contemporaries, their smoking, yelling, unruly kids and shoving is quite jarring.Painful rides   Space Mountain, Indiana Jones and a few other rides had harnesses so uncomfortable that the ride was more torture than fun. Not even the fun painful that rides give, the restraints just hurt.If there is a side alley or walkway, you can guarantee it will smell like stale urine. Urine. In a Disney park, that has been there long enough to reek of ammonia. It was so disappointing to see that Disney couldn't recreate the magic of their oldest parks when given the money, space and clean sheet they had. The cast are great, but the park around them is a joke in comparison to the original. Save the money and take a flight to LA instead.",Disneyland_Paris
163771096,2,2013-6,United States,Family members were booked into Hotel Santa Fe at Disneyland Paris 12 16 June. Flights cancelled on day of travel due to air traffic controllers strike. All travel fees refunded in full no issues. HOTEL no assistance whatsoever. Tried to re schedule dates. First told that dates could be rescheduled then quite abruptly told on day due to travel that it would be treated as a cancellation and that I would have to re book another holiday and to claim of insurance. Total lack of understanding compassion or assistance. Be ware of Disneyland hotels in cases of air traffic issues. Make sure you get a full copy of the T&Cs and actually speak directly to the hotel where possible to ensure you understand their policy in cases of strikes etc. Of course great way of generating additional finance getting paid twice for the same accommodation,Disneyland_Paris
163770703,5,2013-6,Australia,"I seriously underestimated the power of Disney. I though I would be bored out of my brain. I love a good amusement park, but can often tire of them really quickly. My friends and I arrived when the gates opened at 10am and we didn't leave until they kicked us out at 11pm. We didn't want to leave!Highlights were the Aerosmith Rock'n'rollercoaster, Space Mountain, Twilight Zone Tower of Terror but, having said that, we had a blast on all of the rides. The longest we waited in line was about 45 minutes, but it didn't feel like it. The light and fireworks show at the end of the night was mind blowing. Definitely worth hanging around for if visiting.Through no fault of the park, the only downside was we couldn't eat where we wanted because we didn't have reservations. It actually says to ensure you make reservations on the ticket, but I only printed mine the day before and it was too late by then. Consequently, there was nowhere in the park free for dinner, but there are heaps of restaurants outside the park   some quite a bit cheaper. Staff everywhere were amazing. I will definitely be returning. Early June during the week was a great time to go because the park wasn't very busy and the weather was good.",Disneyland_Paris

163756367,3,2013-4,Cyprus,"My 8 year old son and I were in one of the souvenir shops while visiting Disney on April 3rd this year, he wanted to spend his saved up 50 euros on a toy, to remember the visit. We joined the queue to the till , in front of us were only 2 Arabic style dressed women waiting for their purchases to be processed. Before they were finished another lady in the same outfit came to them, passed them a huge pile of goods and a five hundred euro bill (to pay for her so she doesn't have to join the queue) and walked off. Before this was sorted, which took about 10 min, another lady came over to the 2 in front of us and did the same. This time i made a comment, that we are in a queue here and they are being rude. Another 5 minutes later ANOTHER lady came over and brought a pile of stuff with a big note in her hands to pass to the women in from on us.. This time i complained louder. And when ANOTHER one came and did the same once again my complaints got really vocal. At this point in the queue behind us was a person on a wheel chair and a few more. As i was complaining loudly a young french employee walked over to me, asked if i spoke English and suggested that my son and i were to move and join another queue in this shop, as  this one might be taking a while ... This was after at least 20 25 minutes of waiting behind the 2 original people who were in front of us.I believe , if you are going to give preferential treatment to customers with fat wallets that walk around flashing 500 euro notes   at least do it properly, without insulting other customers in your shop. My 8 year old stood there with a 50 in his little hand for the best part of half an hour to be rudely walked over by rich customers, which was blatantly and openly supported by the Disney staff.. Disgusting, disturbing, money grabbing attitude.",Disneyland_Paris

Despite this, its Disney, everytime we interacted with the staff they could not be more helpful. The longest we waited was probably 45 mins. Top rides (personal choice) were...Tower of Terror, Rock & Rollercoaster, Space Mountain & Crushes Coaster. You cant help but get carried away in its natural essence, its such a great day out. Plenty of things to do next time i.e. the villiage etc. if you want to fit it all in you probably need 2 days, maybe 3 at a slow pace. Food is relatively expensive although I guess it is to be expected. For those trying to compare to Orlando, Dont! Just accept it for what it is, you will only be dissapointed.

Everytime one walks through the entrance gate, there is always still excitement and anticipation that he or she is going to have a magical time there. Sad to say, this time round, this didnt quite happen to me: (! While queueing up to enter, we were already confronted with several families with young children. The parents were all puffing away on their cigarettes and blowing smoke into their kids' faces. Needless to say, we were not spared from all that secondary ciggie smoke.Unfortunately for us, the day turned out to be quite a cold one with rain the the forecast. Hence, many families sought shelter in covered areas close to the eating areas as well as near the toilets. When they started smoking there as well, those supposed rest areas became filled with cigarette smoke which meant that we could hardly a respite from the rain nor cigarette smoke! Hence, for non smoker parents who are keen to bring their young children to Paris Disneyland, they really do need to prepare themselves for the shocking amount of smoking and smokers there.",Disneyland_Paris

163482202,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"We are now back from our holiday to Disneyland Paris, what an amazing time we had. There were 6 of us in our party 2 grandparents, mum and dad and 2 children, girl of 5 years and boy of 9 years. We stayed at Hotel Cheyenne which is a Disney Hotel, we have stayed here before, it's a lovely hotel but beware breakfast time is crazy at peak time, we found the best time to go was before 8am, after that it's alot of pushing and shoving and crying children. The breakfast buffet is okay, could do with some sausages though!! We had the all you can eat buffet for our tea one of the nights and this was one of the best all you can eat buffets, and a good price for both adults and children. We also ate at Plaza gardens in DisneyLand Park on one of the nights but we went at peak time and it was crazy!! Food was okay but we preferred the Hotel Cheyennes buffet. We ate a Mcdonalds in Disney village too as this was the cheapest alternative by far. We had a birthday Lunch at Cafe Mickey this was very expensive for what you got but the characters more than made up for the extra expense and the kids loved every minute of it. We took lots of our own snacks and drinks from the UK as this is overly expensive anywhere at DLP, We pre booked the Disney shuttle to and from the airport in the UK as this also can prove pricey if you pay for this in the CDG airport. Make sure you get a good spot for any parades and get your position early!! The 20th anniversary firework castle display was out of this world!! at must see, the only drawback is that this did not start untill 11pm and the kids were getting really tired, again for this get your position early as it was jam packed by 10;30pm. Try not to go at weekends as this is the busiest time, we went tues   friday and that was busy but not jam packed as the weekends would be.",Disneyland_Paris
163466036,4,2013-6,Australia,"We were staying in Paris near the Eiffel Tower so quite a trip out   slept in after a late night and didn't arrive at the park until midday, but that seemed perfect! Pre purchased yellow tickets from the hotel which saved us    7 each, paid full price for a 3Yo which seemed a bit rich!! Took the RER, follow all the signs with Disney park in brown   it's quite clear, as long as you see the sign you are on the right track! Packed a bag full of snacks, and drinks so only had to buy dinner   got a combo for    12 which I thought was good value for a burger, drink, chips and an ice cream considering we were in Disney!!We headed straight for fantasyland and wandered a bit   should have hit a queue straight away! Because we went on a Saturday waits were 30mins  Let our little lass sleep in the pram for an hour in the afternoon and used this time to relax on some grass (jump the fence like everyone) Thought it would be easy to get a cab back to Paris after the show   fail   everyone pushes, and we eventually got a cab that cost us    140 back to Paris!! All in all, a fabulous and memorable day TIPS:  if you want to see a princess get your ticket early (before 2pm) to avoid disappointment  dont miss the 7pm parade or 11pm fireworks, and get a spot about 45mins prior so you can see  avoid the weekend if you can  get on all the rides marked with a tick. These are the  do not miss  rides",Disneyland_Paris

163417895,3,2013-6,United States,"I grew up with fantastic memories of Disney in Orlando, I've been waiting for my daughter to be old enough to remember the trip to appreciated it. Paris is a four hour drive from me, got to the park without insident and parked right away, arriving around 1030 on a Saturday, took about 30 minutes to get into the atrium and pass security. Even at that earlier hour, the park was packed and wait times for all rides exceeded 45 minute. Every bathroom we used was absolutely discusting, only met three staff members which displayed that  Happiest place on earth  persona, all were located in the meet and greet with Micky Mouse. The rest of the staff was well spoken but no smiles or any type of enthusiasm what so ever. The biggest surprise was the lack of characters walking around the park, which was a highlight for me as a child collecting autographs, at this park your required to make reservations to meet certain Disney characters, which i didn't even dream of to research, my daughter came prepared with an autograph book, and left the park in tears after only getting one autograph from Mickey after a two hour wait. We tried to have captain jack sign her book, but he just patted her on the head and walked away. He was the only character we saw in the park walking around all day. The biggest disappoint for my husband; he had his heart set on purchasing the trademark Disney Mickey Mouse hats with our names on them, apparently Disney Paris doesn't sell these at all ?!? It could be my family and myself aren't theme park people, or we had too high of expectations from parks in the states. I will say the Swiss family treehouse was fantastic, the parade at the end of the day was fun, but we had to sit in the side of the rode for two hours to make sure we had a descent view. To conclude; if you have the patience to stand in lines all day in the heat go for it, if not, save your money and visit the other thousands of attractions within Europe that are free.",Disneyland_Paris
163333703,5,2013-5,India,"It travelling to Paris with family, Disneyland is a must visit. I have been there twice, once by bus and once by RER.First, the RER is the best way to reach the place. Many hotels are selling bus visits but it is not worth it   Paris traffic is very heavy and the train journey has better scenery and is more confortable. Dont buy metro tickets on the day you visit Disneyland   buy the RER ticket from your first metro station and it will get you through the metro for free. On the RER, take the upper deck for better view of the scenery. Dont plan anything else for the day   it takes a full day to finish Disneyland.Second, buy a single park ticket   you cannot do more than one park in one day. Unless a die hard disneyfan of course. My kids see more of Japanese cartoons dubbed in Hindi, although after the visit to Disneyland, now watching more of Mickey and Donald.Third, the majority of the rides are for small kids and too boring for adults. For the roller coasters there is a 132 cm height limit   so my 8 year old who was slightly shorter than this could not go on what are fairly simple rollercoasters   not scary ones at all. In fact, nothing in Disney is for kids older than about 14 and they might get quite bored with the simplicity of the rides. Get ready for some disappointment because of the height limits.When it rains, head for Fantasy land because only the rides here will work. Adventure and Frontier land wil lclose down most rides in the rain and reopen in the evening.A good way to beat the rain is to go for a photograph with Mickey   you are out of the rain and also watching Mickey shows on screen while waiting. In fact, I wonder why they dont have screens in all the long lines with Mickey cartoons to keep the waiting and frustrated people entertained   surely this is easy to do? In the pgotograph, hand over your own camera as well   each print from their camera costs about 15 Euros or so   and your own photos might come out a bit different or better.You can bring your own food, but the food here is excellent. IF you are a vegetarian, go for a veg Pizza   it was one of the best Pizzas I have ever eaten, extremely tasty   or maybe I was very hungry. If you reach around 11 in the morning, you would have finished everything by about 7PM and some of the rides you would have taken twice. So you dont have to hurry   you can have a leasurely time here. Kids love the small world, the Pirates of the Caribean, the island explorations on their own and a couple of the roller coasters.Some slickers and umbrellas are a must because Paris has a lot of rain in May.",Disneyland_Paris
163288341,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"The theme park   s138 acres are divided into five theme Lands: Main Street USA, Frontierland, Adventureland, Fantasyland and Discoveryland. Disney, however, have ensured that nothing is left to chance. From the smallest detail in planning to the largest construction, everything tells a story.MAIN STREET USA The first place you see, Main street is Walt Disney   s idealised idea of a small town, Victorian America. The Main Street traffic includes horse drawn rail cars, old double decker buses, an antique fire engine, a Keystone cop style paddy wagon and a vintage car which together tell the story of the evolution of transport. These form part of a working transport system which moves visitors between the Town Square and the central hub of the park near Sleeping Beauty   s Castle, beneath which a Dragon lurks. Here is the Central Plaza, the point from which paths radiate to the other four lands. The Castle itself acts as a landmark throughout the park, enabling guests to find where they are when Aunty Edna has just walked off with the only copy of the map. The Park's pathways are an adventure in themselves and offer both dry and open routes between Frontierland, Adventureland and Fantasyland. Some of these are rarely discovered by the guests, so intent are they on getting to the castle bvut they can save a great deal of time. Watch out for the path that runs from the main entrance to Fort Comstock, past the toilets and towards Adventureland. This route offers cover and a fabulous example of the imagineers' best work, where they imperceptibly change from Frontier America construction to Arabian and Cental African thatching.As you enter Main St, you pass beneath Main St Station from where you can ride a nineteenth century    steam    engine around the park. En route, you pass through a Grand Canyon Diorama, a visual depiction of the Canyon from dawn to dusk. The train also stops in each of the other lands from where you can explore. Trains run every ten minutes but boarding in the lands is sometimes prohibited before midday.  FRONTIERLAND From the Central Plaza, this is the first land you encounter, a musical, visual and live action recreation of America   s Wild West. Entry is through Fort Comstock   s imposing wooden gate and fort grounds, in which children can pretend they   re winning the West all over again, mainly by dropping their sticky lollipops on the heads of unsuspecting passers by.Rides:Big Thunder MountainPhantom manorShows:Chaparall theatre   ADVENTURELAND   Inspired by tales of swashbuckling Pirates and Daring Adventurers in Exotic Places, in Adventureland you can experience wild rides and amazing audioanimatronic productions and then explore the mysteries of Adventure island, an experience all of its own. Watch out for the wobbly barrel, the fantastic rope suspension bridge and the maze of dimly lit caves!Rides:Pirates of the CaribbeanIndiana JonesAdventure isle  FANTASYLANDIt   s an unusual person who doesn   t immediately feel a sense of warmth and security in this, the most magical of the lands. With their usual impeccable sense of design, the Imagineers have modelled the buildings (including the castle) on the animated features in the Disney stable.

We took advantage of the Magic Hours, so didn't have a long queue for the rides included (Buzz, Orbitron, Space Mountain, Peter Pan's Flight, It's a Small World and the Carousel).,...which we went on many times! We were lucky enough to arrive on the Sunday, so we were able to have 1 ride on Dumb; which was closed for the remainder of our holiday, as was Big Thunder Mountain...this was closed before we got there, so unfortunately didn't get to go on it at all.Autopia was a big hit with our 4.5 year old, as was Pirates of the Caribbean, Phantom Manor, the Labyrinth, visiting the dragon at Sleeping Beauty's Castle.....well, everything if I'm honest!! :)Now onto the smoking   it really was annoying.....people were smoking all over the park   in the queues, right by the cafes, in front of staff and nothing was said to them. This alone would put me off going back and I can't understand why nothing is done to police this. Someone was even smoking in the toilet   I went to tell security and he said it's not allowed and walked off!!! Big minus to Disney for allowing this.",Disneyland_Paris
163252403,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"We have been to the park a few times previously & we noticed how there were no Disneyland staff jotted around the park as before, which was a shame as we had told our grandchildren if they got separated from us to go up to one of the Disney staff. Fortunately all was ok but there was no one to ask directions etc. The wait time for the rides was 30 minutes upwards & I noticed one ride had a wait time of 80 minutes. I waited with my grandchildren for the Peter Pan ride for 45 minutes & the ride lasted 3 minutes! They enjoyed it though. The Buzz Light Year ride broke down a couple of times which was of great disappointment for my 5 yr. old grandson. The Dreams light show at 11pm is amazing but such a long wait to get a decent view. Same with the parade at 7 pm & it only lasted 10   15 minutes. Food & drink is expensive & again the wait time in line is about 25 minutes.

163220692,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Where to start? We booked four nights for 3 people, 1 adult, one 13 and one 5 years old. We had to pay full price for the 13 year old, but got an offer of buy 2 nights get 2 nights free.The transfer bus was very busy and the drivers do not help with the luggage. There is no way to form an orderly queue and it does become a free for all. Some people who were first at the bus station did not get on the bus. They then had to wait 45 minutes for the next one.We stayed in the Cheyenne, loads of character, with wild west theme throughout. The room was a little dark and yes it could do with a refurb, but was clean, the beds comfortable and made daily, and fresh towels every day. We would definitely return to this hotel.Staff were very helpful and friendly. We paid extra for half board, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I paid   55 per day for the vouchers.The only way to get the value is to eat in the hotel and we didn't rate the food mainly because it wasn't very hot. We tried the Santa Fe one night but that wasn't much better. Such a shame as the food was good otherwise. The eating places in the park that accept the vouchers are not that expensive. I paid on average between 27 and 40 euros for the 3 of us to eat in the park. Breakfast was very good, be prepared as you do have to decide on arrival what time you want breakfast each day. 7am is very quiet, 7.45 onwards can be very busy but we never had to wait to sit down. DO have breakfast with the Disney characters, fantastic for the kids with plenty of opportunities for photos.The parks were great, so much to do and see. The queues weren't as bad as I expected and on the more popular rides you can scan your park tickets for a time slot to return. The longest we waited was 25 minutes.Don't miss the shows, Lilo and Stich was fantastic, very interactive, the kids loved it, also cinemagic. The Wild West Show, Yeeeha! is a definite, great fun for all the family. Get there early for the best seats.Just make sure you check the times of the return transfer bus to the airport. I assumed they were every 45 minutes back to the airport and needed to be on one by 10.30am. Reception was busy when I went the day before we left and I didn't check the times until the next morning as we came out of breakfast. We had just missed the first one at 8.45am and then found there wasn't another til 11.15am. Expensive and stupid mistake on my part as it cost me 90 euros for a taxi. I didn't let this spoil our holiday, Do go to Disney if you can, it was an experience we wouldn't have missed for the world!",Disneyland_Paris

163167818,4,2013-6,United Kingdom,"Just spent two days at Disneyland and Disney Studios, Paris, with my nieces and sisters. The children (aged 6 and 8) absolutely loved it and said it was  the best day of their lives .Once you've accepted that you have to queue for at least 25 minutes for EVERYTHING (rides, meeting characters, food) and that it's all geared around pester power, it is really enjoyable.Cons: the massive queues for everything, pushing and shoving around the characters (mainly the adults, sadly), pester power everywhere you turn, dreadful overpriced junk food served unbeliebably slowly.Pros: clean, relentlessly cheerful, very professional actors playing the characters (they were so lovely, patient and kind with the children), music everywhere, zones with different themes and  feel  to them, rides are great fun when you finally get on (especially the Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast), plenty of toilets, staff generally very pleasant and friendly.We went in school term time to avoid the worst of the crowds and it was still heaving. Suggest going at the most quiet time you can and getting free  fast pass  tickets in advance where possible.The parade (every day at 7.00pm) was brilliant; you get to see most Disney characters so you won't come away disappointed. I honestly take my hat off to the cast members who play the characters, they stay totally in character at all times and make it really quite magical.",Disneyland_Paris

162768661,2,2013-5,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from visiting Disney with my family and disabled granddaughter. What should have been the trip of a lifetime for her   turned out to be a 'nightmare'. ~Unfortunately, it seems if you are disabled at Disney then your options to ride become limited. They appear to have a rule that only 1 disabled person can ride at any one time!!!!!!! Therefore, all the able bodied pile on and the disabled have to sit and wait or in our case 'book an appointment'! (I thought you only did that at the hairdressers doctors etc.,) Unfortunately, my little granddaughter requires a wheelchair and does not understand the concept of having to wait and gets very distressed. On the first day we found a lovely ride (small world) it was perfect because they had an adapted boat and we could wheel her right on   she loved it and we went round twice! There were only three rides in the park that she could tolerate, but small world was her favourite. We went back the following two days and had a great experience until FRIDAY! We arrived at the ride and there was a small group of 3 waiting in the disabled queue. We were met by one of the attendants to be told  you will have to make an appointment . My daughter and I looked flabbergasted and asked why because we hadn't done this on the previous three days   so what had changed. She told us we could come back in approx. 1 hour 20 min and waived papers in front of us of what appeared to be bookings. By this time the people who had been sat in the disabled queue had boarded and set off. My granddaughter was getting really distressed and we were trying to calm and reassure her. Then the boat which is designed to carry the wheelchair arrived and we pointed out that this was free and not being used   so why could she not have a ride. Again the attendant waived papers at us and stipulated we needed an appointment!! The three of us left small world in tears! They could not see or acknowledge that this little girl had been left frustrated, distressed and very confused!! The staff do not appear to use what we call 'COMMON SENSE'!!!!!!!!!! Because that's all that was required and a little girls day would have been made and not ruined. Disney overall for the disabled (depending on level of disability) easy to push round, grounds very nice but if wheelchair bound only a few rides available. They all indicate person must be able to transfer themselves!

The staff at the hotel are so helpful and friendly ,nothing is too much trouble everywhere you go you will have a great time.Make sure you book all your restaurant times in advance as it gets very busy .The queue can be quite annoying if you dont get in the park early but make sure you stay for the midnight laser display its well worth the visit and not to be missed.There is so much to do but ideally 4 days is enough by that time you can see all the park ,no matter how old you are if you have never been its a must !",Disneyland_Paris

Of our three days the first was warmish, second very wet and third very cold, which is never going to add to a good experience. Sadly its also incredibly expensive with most meals (just snack lunchtime stuff) costing around   10.00 per person for very average food. How families cope I don't know.We took advantage of the disney hotel   coach transfer   flight all booked on line and as we both had special birthdays decided to treat ourselves to 3 nights at the Disney Hotel (lovely) which was the perfect location and we got two extra 'magic hours' with entry to the park (just Disneyland) from 8.00am rather than 10.00. This was great as we managed to get on lots of rides before the park got busy. We ticked most things off the list over the three days and enjoyed ourselves. The staff, although friendly, do not have the very happy demeanour of those in Florida (probably the cold weather!)The firework spectacular every evening at 11.00 is worth waiting for with the castle coming alive with lasers, fire, water and projections   great fun.We had a fun time. Will we go back   probably unlikely. Shame.",Disneyland_Paris
162709808,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,My husband and I have been to this attraction twice and both times were fantastic. If you are a wheelchair user your career goes free. Once in you go to customer services who give you a booklet which is extremely helpful. Some of the rides have different entrances for is led people and you just have o let the staff know. When there is a procession the people who have wheel chairs have a designated spot to enable them to see without having to look over people standing in front. The staff were so helpful and if you purchase items from gift shops they can all be kept for you till you are leaving which saves u carrying them about. Th restaurants are good but tend to get booked up early u need to make a reservation. But would definitely go back.,Disneyland_Paris
162708056,2,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Visited for one day   this was our first visit and although daughter aged 4 1 2 loved it   we both thought that it was only worth a one day visit and unless they refurbished it and made it more affordable that we wouldnt ever come back, a number of rides were closed too so that was disappointing including Thunder Mountain which would of been good fun and the Pirate ship. Alot of areas need new rides and a lick of paint, looking very faded now, didnt see Mickey or Minnie either. Dresses cost 60 euros and toys were from 10 euros upwards, food cost 40 euros for 2 adults and one child   a very expensive day out ! In all very disappointing visit.",Disneyland_Paris

Many of the rides were closed, most restaurants were closed, the haunted house, peter pan's flight and pirate ship also closed at times during the day as they had broken down.

162692522,4,2013-5,United Kingdom,"The park is still great and more enjoyable for a second visit with kids than the Studios. Rather than stay in one of the nearby hotels which are expensive, un French and ultimately Travel Lodges with ribbons, we stayed in a nice B B in Bussy Saint George, which proved easy to access. We also ate each evening in the restaurants in Serris, opposite the RER station and good value; again more of a French experience and a pleasant contrast to the awful food at Disney. The only downside is having to pay 15E for parking at Disney if you don't stay at one of the hotels nearby   but worth it. The rear challenge in the park is trying to avoid all the tat. Our Buzz Lightyear lazer gun broke within a week. We sent it back to Disney who kindly replaced it, but that replacement broke within two days   typical. Also, the French get much better deals on tickets, not open to the Brits with our credit cards. Disney say you can access the cheaper tickets by calling their Paris office. We did this and saved a fortune   but it isn't easy   deliberately so of course, as the Brits are seen as a soft touch. I raised this under competition rules with the EU, who were equally as useless. Hope that helps!",Disneyland_Paris
162689437,4,2013-5,Belgium,"We spend one day at the park and had a lot of fun. Even though we don't realy do all the rides the park has amusement for all. Food, drinks and souvenirs are all expensive and of very low quality, but if you can overlook that you'll have a lot of fun.",Disneyland_Paris
162686980,3,2013-5,Canada,"Having been to Disneyland in California and Disneyworld a few times, we couldn't miss the chance to go to Disney Paris. It's OK but not up to their usual standards. It didn't seem to have the Disney  buzz  and excitement that we were used to. Not the same enthusiasm from cast members that we have come to expect. Almost an attitude of indifference Very little music playing throughout the park. Very strange. Having said that, the rides didn't have long lines at all the day we came, so that was a bonus.",Disneyland_Paris
162667859,4,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Disneyland Park is very similar to the Magic Kingdom at Disneyland in Florida   in style, lands, rides and cleanliness but not in organisation, e.g. no queues for characters, just a free for all; very limited Disney photo pass (great idea even if it is expensive); the worlds slowest round park train; lack of good signs; lack of good restaurants. Still a magical place, for kids and adults alike, especially the parade and superb firework and lights show at park closing.One tip: if you have young kids ( 6) take a cheap pushchair for them to rest sleep in even if they no longer use one, it is a god send especially as the ones you can hire look more lie trolleys!",Disneyland_Paris
162662327,3,2013-5,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from our third visit in 5 years to Disneyland, Paris, travelling with our two grandsons (now age 11 & 13) and their parents. We stayed in the New York New York hotel purely for ease of access to the parks but would be hard pushed to call this a four star hotel as there are many areas that look extremely tired and in need of some major refurbishment. One observation which may seem insignificant, but it is important   the music that greets you in the lifts in the hotel is absolutely awful   sound quality, choice of music and too loud   especially first thing in the morning! This was the first time the boys parents had come with us and we were so disappointed to find a more than acceptable amount of attractions and facilities closed. There was a serious lack of information available too and even major attractions (i.e. Big Thunder Mountain) were scheduled to open at some time when we were there, but it just didn't happen! Whilst it is acknowledged and accepted there has to be on going maintenance and upkeep this surely could be concentrated, if possible, to times when the parks weren't quite so busy. Some of these closures were planned for this particular week which has been half term for the majority of school children in the UK and although visitors come from many different countries a vast proportion do come from the UK. We had considered the Newport Bay hotel when booking but were put off by the fact the Swimming Pool was closed for the entire time we would have been there. As well as the planned closures of rides and experiences the refreshment facilities were sadly lacking too   there were very few refreshment carts actually open around the parks which at times, was very frustrating. Some shops didn't open until 4:00p.m. which one can only assume is lack of staffing and whilst I am on the topic of staff   were has all the Disney enthusiasm gone? Whether it was in the hotel, in the attractions,in the shops, in the restaurants (apart from the Rainforest Cafe) we were met by 'cast members' with very little enthusiasm for the job in hand which was disappointing as we know how it not only used to be but actually should be and was all part of the Disney experience and the Disney magic. We have always been real Disney fans, taking our own children to Disney in Florida many times when they were young children and teenagers and I hope they carry on this family tradition with their children but sadly I feel by our latest experience, this just may not happen.",Disneyland_Paris

162632309,3,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Having been to Disney in Florida over 20 years ago I was somewhat disappointed with the Park. It was clean but felt it lacked the energy of the American parks. The rides were ok, but little changed from previous visit. My boys did enjoy themselves and the rides, we used fast pass to help avoid longer queues but did manage to avoid the longer queues anyhow. The Buzz lightyear laser blast which was the favourite. There were too many rides where the time spent actually on the ride was a bit of joke in relation to queuing time   less than a minute on Dumbo it seemed. Dragon under the castle was also a hit. Space Mountain was also fun.The park is very attractive, clean and well maintained. The various parades were good but I was disappointed with the closing 'Disney Dreams' show. We stood on Main Street to watch it. The show was good but didn't leave me going 'wow'.The boys did manage to meet a lot of the characters though, but as other reviewers have said, you need to be prepared to be pushed and shoved as its a bit of a scrum when you do see them.Shops were ok but pricey. Each shop had some variation of goods, but it was mostly the same stuff. Restaurants are really expensive but food is ok but nothing more. We had food vouchers which limited our choice of menu but everywhere was very expensive. We visited both parks and enjoyed the stunt show at Disney Studios and Cinemagic   although we're surprised to see a scene from The Exorcist in a family show! However, queue times here for Toy Story and Cars rides were quite long in relation to length of ride themselves.My two boys (4 & 6) had a great time, and they came back with great memories. It was sad that I just felt Disney was living off its' laurels and not putting any time into developing the park further. But then they have a model which works I guess so why change things?",Disneyland_Paris
162605282,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,All I can say about this park is magical but their advice is 'be at the right place and the right time' this is very true. When you go there make sure you know what's going on and what time everything happens a lot of people didn't know about the 11pm parade at night which is one of the best parades there!! There are information boards everywhere across the park so theres loads of chances to find out. Also instead of waiting for the shuttles buses which are quiet as long as its not peak time (afterparades open closetime) it is a lovely walk along side a river to all Disney hotels which only takes about 10mins to get to Santa fe which is the furthest away.,Disneyland_Paris

This accommodation is the best that we have stayed in and we will use it again. For the benefit of anybody trying to find it, the Ranches are well signposted from sortie 13 of the A4. The park is off sortie 14 so very close, but not walkable.Several of the parks facilities were closed, which was a surprise as it was a UK bank holiday weekend, but MacDonalds is the same everywhere, Annettes was not so good and space was very confined. The Planet restaurant was good if expensive although the photographs that were taken at the table were of good quality and reasonable priced.",Disneyland_Paris

162500014,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Where to begin? I have always wanted to go but with a fear of heights and rides I was never sure it would suit me. Finally, my love of Disney prevailed and booked a trip for myself and my partner.The first thing I would say is that you have to be prepared to wait. Obvious I know but the behaviour of some people was absurd, they made queuing up much harder then it needed to be complaining does not make it move any quicker! In particular the rides for families such as Autopia, Peter Pan and Buzz Lightyear. About half way through the day we found out about Fast Pass which we will use for next time!The second thing is that if you find yourself lining up for food at a snack station, do a 2 minute walk and you will probably find another empty! We queued for 10 mins in fantasy land when we realised it was one man serving and making drinks, we left and found the March Hare snacks and served within a minute! The variety of rides was great, for a first timer on any kind of ride (yes I am 24) we went on Pirates of the Caribbean. It was very dark while waiting to keep hold of your little ones! The ride was fantastic and not too scared and there was only little drops and a bit of splashing. I was probably the most scared out of everyone on my boat!My favourite part was Discoveryland which included Space Mountain, Star tours, Buzz light year laser blast. I don't think there was a ride here that I didn't like. Disappointed that Pizza Planet was closed!The other areas were lovely, although I agree with some of the reviews that the Peter Pan ride was over too quickly. It was annoying as we had waited 30 minutes for something that really didn't make up for it like the others had.I was surprised that we only saw 3 characters, Peter Pan, Jack Sparrow and The Mad Hatter. I imagine this may be frustrating for kiddies trying to collect lots of autographs!We were savvy when it came to the late afternoon and went for dinner at Annette's for 5pm, there was minimum queuing and when we were done we walked back to the park to get a good position for the parade at 7.The parade was wonderful and all of the favourites were there!Overall a lovely day and it was worth the wait to really appreciate it.",Disneyland_Paris
162448232,2,2013-5,United Kingdom,"What a disappointment. Having visited the Californian original twice and loved it, this Paris experience was a real let down. The rides were fun, of course, if you could cope with a long wait for each   in the US these queues were entertained by Disney characters, magicians, conjurors, singers, but not Paris where there was absolutely nothing. Indeed most of the staff were grumpy and bored, a total contrast to the buzz and fun generated at the original Park. Many of the rides closed early, so our children were denied to chance to ride the steamboat or take the train which had packed up by early evening (even though the Park was advertised as being open until 11pm.) As for the food   what a joke. Most of the outlets were shut. Those that were open offered long queues for the privilege of enduring very average junk food at fancy prices. Finally, out of desperation, we booked into the Silver Spur steakhouse, where I had a barely adequate steak, my wife's salmon had to go back as it was scarcely warm, the children's skewer meals were just about OK   and the bill was well over   100. Casting round for some upside   we really enjoyed the motor stunt show in the Studios section. This went some way to offset the 30 minutes wait at the ticket booth while sullen and semi competent staff messed about trying to decide whether to accept our fully paid Brittany Ferries Disneyland tickets   they did so in the end. In short, our verdict was simply this   don't bother, save up to go to the real deal Disneyland in California or just enjoy some of the many far better theme parks nearer to home.",Disneyland_Paris
162441888,5,2013-5,France,"The rides are first class, with plenty for all ages. We took our 3yr old and went on:Pirates of the caribean(our son was a little scared and woried queing up for this but wanted to go again once he'd been on it).Buzz lightyear laser blast which was great.Peter pan ride (ok but too fast to really look at all the scenes in the ride and a very long queue)Dumbo ride (nice but only lasts about 60secs and has really big queues)Phantom manor (left our son with the inlaws for this one, but not really scary for adults, maybe good for older kids)Its a small world (ok but more for small kids and those into 'cute')Nautilus (ok, no queue when we went but very quick walk through attraction, son loved the octopus though)Don't forget to go under the castle and see the Dragon (its easy to miss this)The park is very attractive, clean and well maintained. There are some really picturesque scenes for great photos. When the park lights up in the early evening the atmosphere is great; the parade at 19:00 is brilliant with all the characters parading along main street; and the fireworks and light show at closing time is amazing if a little late for small kids as it didn't start until 10.40pm. We did seem to miss most of the characters though, get a timetable if you want to meet the characters and get autographs, and prepare to be pushed and shoved as its a bit of a scrum when you do see them.Once you find your way around the queues and get over the prices in the shops and restaurants its a really good holiday. We had 2 days in the park and did pretty much 9am till 11pm both days which was exhausting, it is probably better to do it over 3 4 days especially if you have older kids who will want to go on the more popular roller coasters. We didn't really go in the studios much, not much there for our son, but we did go on the tram tours which was a little disappointing, the first display lot is great with fire and water and the tram shaking which we thought meant the ride was going to be great, but that was pretty much it with the rest of the ride basically just looking at props from films. Shops were ok, if a little pricey, each shop had a slight variation of goods, but it was mostly the same stuff. Restaurants are really expensive but food is ok(as long as you don't mind american diner style e.g burgers) rain forest restaurant had a really good atmosphere.Overall a really great place to go and loads too do.",Disneyland_Paris
162441009,4,2013-5,Australia,"Disneyland 'is what it is'. If you don't like it don't go. If you don't like crowds then don't go when it is busy. There is no reason to spend 90% of your time in queues if you do not want too. Do your research, work out what is important and either get 'fastpass' entrances ahead of time (book one hour ahead for each ride) or get there very early, line up, then rush to your own particular 'No. 1' attraction. The TA reviews for this attraction are littered with people complaining who either haven't done their research or don't know what they are doing. Yes the food is expensive   if you don't like it bring food with you! It's not rocket science! Same applies to non alcoholic drinks.So don't go unless you are prepared to research first   Research is not an option, it's a prerequesite!",Disneyland_Paris

Poured with rain one day and we bought the Disney plastic ponchos at Euro 9.99 a go   ouch   buy yours for 2 for   1 from Poundland before you go!! Check park opening times as they vary each day (Disney hotel guests have 2 hours in the parks before the public are allowed in) and head for the popular rides first   we only waited 5 minutes for some! Hotel Cheyenne great   rooms clean and bright, bathroom a bit tired but clean. Breakfast is busy but always moving   we took sandwich bags and made up ham and cheese rolls for lunch (saving     's)   they are onto the fact people do this but as long as you are discreet they leave you to it! FastPass brilliant for rides, no cost and means you can book a time slot (only one ride at a time) and then really only queue for 5 10 minutes (as opposed to an hour!). We did the Buffalo Bill dinner show   seems costly but you get a meal, a show, unlimited beer and coke, plus a free cowboy hat each   good was great for all ages (mild chilli, roast new potatoes, bbq chicken, sausage   ice lollies or apple pie and ice cream). Characters don't wander around the parks, you usually have to queue to meet them (we had two every morning at Hotel Cheyenne for photo opportunities and autograph signing!). We didn't meet the Princesses (Princess Pavilion)   queue was 2 hours long (no Fast Passes for this one) and you couldn't choose your princess so wasn't worth it. Can do the Meet the Characters lunch but did hear the food is very un child friendly and v expensive. 7pm Parade is brilliant (get to the Main Street half an hour earlier and sit where you want to stand on edge of the pavement   best view!) and fireworks at 11pm an absolute must   lots of little ones there watching too and its really brilliant.

Wonder if there is cheaper way.Please noted that there is a direct Eurostar from London to Marne La Vallee Chessy (same price) at 10.14am. But reach Disneyland at 2pm (GMT 1). We took an earlier Eurostar to left our luggage at hotel first. Once you reach Marne La Vallee Chessy, immediately buy a return ticket. Cost about    7  to any station in Paris. It will be extremely crowded at park closing time after Disney Dream show. Buy Disneyland ticket earlier using FNAC website. Use google translate in Chrome. Choose francilien ticket which is    10 cheaper compared to Disneyland website. Everyone can use this. No problem at entrance. Pay by credit card. Print e ticket and directly scan the QR code to enter the park. No queue at all. Please grab TWO maps (Disneyland map and show schedule) at the sides of the entrance!

162349311,4,2013-5,United Kingdom,"I spent 4 days at the resort. At first it was a disappointment   there a some definite negatives:  Queues. These are inevitable, but queuing 40  minutes for a 2 minute ride is madness. You can partially alleviate this by avoiding holidays weekends, staying at a Disney hotel and getting early morning access, or by waiting until after the 19:00 parade.  Food. From what I can tell you can only obtain fast food, no matter what the marketing blurb states. It quickly becomes nauseating, and worse costs a fortune.  Shops. Selling the same tat everywhere you turn. There is no relief. Also, you can buy most things cheaper in a Disney store at home.However, I did enjoy myself; and my daughter had a wonderful time. The rides are first class; the park is very attractive; when the park lights up in the early evening the atmosphere is great; the parade at 19:00 is brilliant; and the display at closing time is amazing.Once you find your way around the queues and get over the constant gouging for you cash, you can start to enjoy yourself",Disneyland_Paris
162336095,4,2013-5,United Kingdom,"We stayed in the newport bay hotel, an enormous edifice attractivley painted white and situated at the end of a concrete edged lake. The hotel was constantly crowded at all times. The rooms were clean and bright apart from the bathroom which needed renewing and had the odour of a possible leaking toilet the beds we found were too hard.! Breakfast was akin to school canteens, preformed ham ,cheap cheese as well as yoghurt and cereals but as there are over 1000 rooms it would have been impossible to cater with any finesse. We took the shuttle bus the first day which again was crowded and to my horror experienced a woman dragging my 5 yr old granddaughter off the bus backwards by her coat hood only to take her place herself. Needless to say we walked to the park for the remaining days. The park itself was a children's paradise geared to extract money from doting parents in the numerous shops. We expected the food to be burger and chips or similar but was pleasantly surprised to have some nice meals particularly at 'walts' .expect to be on your feet for 12hrs to see everything, it was noted there were no seats for tired grandmas waiting by each ride. The parades and firework finale were superb well worth keeping children up to see them. We managed by taking enough pushchairs for our four to nap in.

162331943,1,2013-5,Australia,"This review is about Disneyland Park Paris, not Disneyland Studio Paris which is marginally better.We were very disappointed with our visit. The park had our expectations high yet we have had much better experiences at theme parks that cost 1 6th as much as this did, literally. The entrance alone was 400 Euros. The food is overpriced so much that it is outrageous.The park is outdated, dirty, and old. As one other post wrote, it is past its use by date. The motor car ride had mechanics on duty repairing card constantly, on the fly, and there were traffic jams caused by several broken down cars. For goodness sakes buy new motors after 20 years and fix it. The Buzz Lightyear ride broke down 4 times while we were on it! 4 times, I kid you not! The only new stands are the 4001 souvenir shops that are everywhere. The rides are few and far between. None of them are of the quality we expect after visiting parks such as Legoland (Germany), Warner Bros World (Aust), Wet   N   Wild, Seaworld or even Luna Park in Sydney which must be older than Disneyland. The wait is intolerable, not just for rides but also food and tickets. The staff are on the whole where rude and only there for their own social life with other staff. The exception were the grounds staff who diligently picked up the litter dropped by thoughtless people. Many of the rides were broken. We were there for a full day. We rode for about 10 minutes. We queued for about 6 hours. The toilets were disgusting; old and dirty.Although there is a policy in small writing not to smoke in the main areas this is not followed through and the cigarette smoke is outrageous, especially that the main customers there are very young children.This park should be boycotted by the general public. It is a disgrace and outrageously overpriced.Save your money and go to Surfers Paradise in Queensland.",Disneyland_Paris
162324095,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Ok, so first of I want to say I was not looking forward to this trip as the thought of queuing and lots of children running about filled me with dread!!! I only agreed to go with my daughter and 2 year old granddaughter after lots of goading      oh how glad I am that she persuaded me to go!!!!We flew from Belfast to Charles de Gaulle airport, then transferred to the high speed train (10mins and you are at the entrance to Disney) The free shuttle bus across the road took us to our hotel (Thomas Cook Explorers Hotel) took about 8 mins.We arrived late in the evening so didn   t get to Disney until the following day. Well what can I say, when you walk through the gates of the Disneyland Park it is just amazing, it   s like another world. The Disneyland Hotel is beautiful and oh how I would have loved to be able to afford to stay in it   .someday maybe, funds permitting. The attention to detail of the buildings and cleanliness of the streets is exceptional. Litter never got a chance to lie too long. Straight ahead was the castle and looking up at it made my daughter and I get very emotional (big kids at heart) She wants to go and work there now!!!We proceeded to seek out rides suitable for my granddaughter and thankfully the queues weren   t too long. My daughter also went on some of the bigger rides which she thoroughly enjoyed.We found out the parade began at 7 o   clock so claimed our spot early. I had no idea what to expect but again it was amazing, stunning, magical and the music they play during the parade is so catchy. The floats and characters are so colourful, the attention to detail is breath taking   and we got emotional all over again. We actually stayed to watch the parade every night we were there!!!! One night Minnie mouse, Tinkerbell and Piglet all singled out my wee granddaughter (see was wearing a Minnie Mouse outfit) and she was so cute.One of the nights we stayed for the late show, and what a show it is. If you can, stay and see it at least once   .you will definitely not be disappointed. They lasers, fireworks and show itself left me an emotional wreck again, I cried through most of it!!!! All I seemed to do was cry, but you just get caught up in the magic of it all!!!The hi light for us was when my 2 year old granddaughter got to meet her idol, Minnie mouse. Her wee face was a picture and luckily we captured it all on camera.So if you are like me and reluctant to go, my advice would be, just do it. I defy anyone not to enjoy Disney. We are already pricing it for next year!!!THANKS DISNEYLAND PARIS FOR SOME WONDERFUL MEMORIES THAT WILL LAST FOREVER!!! xx",Disneyland_Paris
162317129,4,2012-6,Denmark,"it's been quite some time since I visited Disneyland! but I can only remember that it was worth it! with rides for all   big and small or young and old, you well get a load of fun here!",Disneyland_Paris
162307694,3,2012-10,United Kingdom,"having booked the tickets for me and my sister to take our two younger cousins as a suprise, i think we were more excited then the children. we decided to drive there on ferry which we will never be doing ever again, but finally getting to disneyland, we unpacked and went for dinner. at 29euros each all you can eat (very expensive) for people who dont eat much and the variety of food was limited. 1st day in park, well it was Halloween and halfterm which definately not the best time to go, ques are upto 120mins for some rides and with kids isnt fun. the Hallowen show was absolutly AMAZING !!! THE LIGHT SHOW WOW. second day we visited the studios next door same length of time for rides so for every ride we spent a minimum of an hour waiting. the Magic Circus hotel was good, very clean and tidy, and with swimming pool, and bus to park frequently. all in all the holiday was great, but next time wil bring more money for food as very expensive, not be driving and definately not be going during school holidays x.",Disneyland_Paris
162277658,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Disney Paris is well worth a visit...or perhaps I should say two or three visits, because there is so much to see and do. We are 2 adults (early 40's) with 3 kids aged 8,10 and 12. We stayed this time at the Santa Fe hotel, in the May bank holiday (Sun evening to Tues evening). If you are staying at Santa Fe, New York hotel or Newport Bay hotel, and you are 'mobile', I urge you to not use the shuttle bus and walk along the river or lake to the parks. Go through Disney Village, as the baggage checking area there is much quicker!If you have hopper tickets, I would advice you to hop from park to park (morning, afternoon) to get the most out of your stay. Don't spend just one day in one park at a time, because you will feel like you have missed out. Use the free fast pass ticket system (you can only use one pass for one ride at a time). We would have used fast pass this time for Big Thunder Mountain, but it has been closed for repairs, and will not open until after the summer.Be prepared for the shock of how expensive everything is. A simple lunch of 1 burger, 2 fries, 2 chicken nugget portions, 2 hotdogs and 2 coffees (no soft drinks) costs 50 Euros. Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared for the weather to change everyday while you are there. I took sandals in our rucksack, as I suffer from hot feet. Take painkillers (strong ones), you are going to need them! If you are staying late for the Disney Dreams show (in May it starts at 11pm) the evening becomes chilly, so bring something warm with you.Best rides in our opinion 'Big thunder Mountain' (when open), 'Pirates of the Caribbean', 'Haunted Mansion'. Younger children would be more suited to Fantasyland. My boys loved the Starwars ride as well in Discoveryland. Cafe Hyperion in Discoveryland has animated short films showing all day, and that keeps the kids entertained while you sit and rest.The parade was very nice, but our kids were too tired to really appreciate it. Don't sit in front of the castle to the left looking towards Main Street! We sat there for almost an hour, and then discovered that the parade didn't go down that way. The parade starts from the back of the park not the front. Disney Dreams is spectacular, but my boys were suffering with their aching feet and legs, and were trying to sit down through most of it. We would have liked to have gone on 'Space Mountain', but our 8 year old boy (average height) was still not tall enough.We only ate at fast food places, and we had our 'main meals' at Disney Village instead. I have to recommend cafe Mickey to give your kids the extra special Disney experience. Book ahead!On sunny days the crowds are large and waiting times for the rides take longer. Cloudy or rainy days, you will get to see more in a day. Try not to go peak season (August).",Disneyland_Paris
162271574,3,2013-5,Ireland,"This is the main park and honestly I'd struggle to recommend it if you have kids under 5 (as we did). There are large queues for even the toddler rides. You can minimise these somewhat by arriving during magic hours (not as much as you'd think though, every hotel guest is queueing for the handful of rides that are open), using the official App to monitor wait times and using FastPass (for the handful of rides that offer it). Kids of this age just will not tolerate queuing for longer that 20 minutes especially when few rides offer any entertainment while queuing. I think it's even crazy for adults to queue in excess of 60 minutes for a ride that lasts 3 minutes! The park is pleasant to walk around however (if it's not raining!) and there's plenty of outdoor seating. I really liked how you can take your own photos with the characters (except for the Meet Mickey attraction). What I really didn't like was the insane amount of shops all mostly selling the same things. Honestly there are far more magical natural experiences out there for your kids.",Disneyland_Paris

162258704,5,2013-1,Australia,"I am a 20 year old guy and had so much fun in Disneyland. It really is a place for everyone, no matter how old you are. Everything was amazing and I can't think of anything bad to say about it. I went in January so there wasn't huge lines and the weather was fine (cold, but not freezing and it only drizzled rain a few times) but this would obviously be variable. In my opinion is was definitely worth braving the slightly poor weather to escape the massive crowds. Prices are high, but you know that is going to be the case, it's Disneyland. There are plenty of ways you can avoid spending, bring prepacked lunches and snacks, all the attractions are free, and if you are bringing kids just don't take them into any of the shops!",Disneyland_Paris
162257651,4,2013-5,United States,"The Park is nice. Like all Disney parks, it's very clean. We were there during an  off season  time, but the hour   lines formed very quickly. One obvious reason was (at the  Startours 3000 ) they simply chose to not provide enough staff to have all of the ride open. So ya gotta wait. But that was only after our 8:00 AM   10:00 AM  early  admission time was done. That was one of their big selling points....be in the park before the crowds and get treated special. Sounds good, but only a few of the good rides and attractions were actually operating before 10:00 AM. DO NOT get sucked into their Davey Crocket place. Unless one pays a big up charge to stay in the few  newer  cabins, your stuck in one of their old (20 years??) beat up cabins. Ours was gross. Shower didn't really work well. Kitchen cabinets are coated thick with many years of greasy fingers. Furniture is crappy. Not really too, too, too clean. Otherwise, it's Disney. The parks are nice.",Disneyland_Paris
162248598,5,2013-4,Singapore,"It was a spontaneous decision to visit Disneyland (unplanned) on the morning of the day itself, we went right after a short shopping spree at La Vallee which was only about 10 minutes away. By the time we got to Disneyland, it was already just past 2pm in the afternoon. Located an information booth (house) and we were offered highly discounted tickets for the park. Not sure why it was so but we were happy with the bargain! Entered Hollywood studios and after a quick lunch, tried to queue for some shows. Only managed to catch one show as we had opted to go over to the Park instead, to enjoy as many rides as we could and also the Disney on Parade. Loved all the rides on the carousel and train and more. The merchandising was superb, they do it well. The food was good too, unlike some theme parks which offered poor dining quality and fare. The closing finale at 10pm was just outstanding, with the 30 minute lights and water plus fireworks extravaganza taking us on a Disney journey that was nothing short of spectacular. Never thought we would enjoy it so much, it was great too that the sun came out all day long and the blue skies provided such a wonderful backdrop to the magic there. Though there was a lot to do and we probably didn't cover half of it given that we only spent less than a full day there, still, it was still probably one of the best spontaneous decisions we ever made this France trip.",Disneyland_Paris
162237353,5,2012-10,United Arab Emirates,"Disneyland is really a visual treat ,both for kids and adults alike.It truly is  the happiest place on earth.  We consider ourselves lucky that we got to visit this place.The rides are all theme based and the best part seems to be the carnival that is so overwhelmingly charming that one loses control over one's emotions and just flows with the music,the dance and the fun.Its like a dream come true..a fantasy land fun filled n pure unadulterated pleasure. It is best not to choose a holiday while visiting to avoid long queues n crowds.The best option is to book your tickets online and there is a special free service that enables you to skip queuing up.At the entrance there is a shop where one can buy foodies and carry inside.Stroller and other equipment are available for rent.It is a not to be missed place.Remember to keep 2 days free for enjoying both the parks which are massive and cannot be seen in a single day.",Disneyland_Paris
162097794,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"I am almost 30 and this was my first visit to a Disney theme park. I had ridiculously high expectations as I have been brought up with the films and surrounded by the characters since a very early age but never had the opportunity to vist until now!I loved every single second of my time in the park, I wish I had bought a two day pass so I could have visited the studios also but just had too much to occupy me in the main park! I loved all the rides and couldn't fault the service and friendliness of the staff at all. Yes you have to queue but I am sorry what do you expect! It's a theme park and this is normal! We really liked the fast pass tickets as it meant you could ensure you had a designated time to return to the most popular rides and jump the queue meanwhile go on and see other things you also don't want to miss out on.The only slight downside to the day was our waiting time for lunch, this was however down to one particularly slow staff member rather than the place itself so all is forgiven and again I expected to have to queue at peak times. I didn't think food was that unreasonably priced to be honest, again remember this is a theme park and all similar places charge the same prices. We had 2 hotdog meals with fries and a drink for about    20 at lunch then ate in the lucky nugget restaurant in the evening, bill was    36 for 2 mains, 2 drinks and 2 desserts all accompanied by a live band! Can't go wrong in my opinion.Best moments of the day for me were the parade and Disney dreams show   I got quite emotional during both and thought the final show was outstanding a true spectacle! We were really lucky with getting good positions for both and didn't have to wait around for an hour like some do. We turned up just outside the castle just 5minutes before the parade and were fine.

162078048,1,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Have just returned from a weekend of hell in Disneyland Paris! Being a BIG Disney fan I'm horrified to say it was the worst holiday we have had. On arrival   We had pre booked tickets and still had to queue for hours with the people who were buying their tickets! What's the point of pre booking? We were then disgusted to be greeted by a rude cashier!Once in the park   Rides and shops shut. Many without explanation, even when you ask staff! we just got told it was closed, you can kind of see that as there is a rope across it! The staff member was rude and clearly did not was to be there. By the end of the weekend I was fed up with the amount of closed signs. Its peak season why so much closed? The rides which were open half the carriages were broke! which was causing long queues. The fast passes were ridiculous either sold out or too late in the day. So we didn't get much done at all, complete waste of money. We was not going to queue for hours for a 2 minute ride! Actually witnessed a staff member being very rude to a women when she asked him about a time on fast pass. The food and drink were over priced and not exactly worth it. 20th Anniversary? well this was a complete disappointment. Castle was closed off during the day to prepare for the show at 11pm (lots of disappointed people in few minutes we were there) only 1 parade which was not until 7pm. Disney Dreams was a complete mess. People pushing each other out of the way I was pushed and shouted at by one women for walking out of the crowd as was so fed up with seeing nothing!!

We went to see santa in Santas Village and we were delighted. the que was very long but when we finally got to santa and away from the annoying elves it was amazing. In santas village there we suprise meet and greets we had Minnie Mouse and Pluto in their christmas outfits.There was the christmas tree lighting ceremony and a few bands playing christmas music around the parks. I would suggest going to the big rides early on and then taking your time walking around. we stopped at a resturaunt near to Indiana Jones and they were playing the Bongos they invited us to learn to play. we would have missed this experience had we of been rushing",Disneyland_Paris
162034712,4,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Stayed at hotel New York in Disneyland Paris. Good points, spotlessly clean all around hotel and bedrooms which for a 4* hotel were adequate but basic. All staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful. Just next to Disney Village so near to main restaurants and I think the nearest hotel to railway station, about 5 mins walk. Not so good were the beds, which to be honest we're the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in. Also hotel food was not good either at breakfast or the evening buffet. The park itself is full of shops and restaurants where all items are very expensive. By 10.30 all rides had long queues, so fast pass is recommended if you have a limited time on site. If you stay on site take a break in the afternoon and go back to park around 7 and most rides only have a 5  15 wait.

162023376,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"We booked this at very short notice, and bought our guide book after we had booked the 5 day break, (via Eurostar). We should have purchased the guide book first because it was really excellent on how to get there, where to stay, what to do, what to eat, and when to do it all. The book is called  Disneyland Paris  by Simon and Susan Veness, (ISBN   978 0 572 03914 1), they appear to be real Disney fanatics, but have been there often enough to have discovered the flaws in the system and point them out to you so you can go forewarned. No doubt you have read that the food is frighteningly expensive and only of moderate quality, the service in the restaurants can be poor and you should check your bills carefully, but the character meals in Caf   Mickey really do more than make up for it, indeed all the characters are excellent, the rides are great, the attention to detail is marvellous, the 7.00pm parade is fabulous, and  Fantillusion  when the park closes is well worth keeping the kids up for.Go, you won't regret it, but buy the book before you book, and take about 3 times more money than you thought you would need!!",Disneyland_Paris

161920084,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from a 5 day visit and went to Disneyland Paris twice. The first day was throwing it down but being a hardened Brit and used to the rain it didn't dampen our spirits and we had a fantastic time. There were 6 in our group, two children aged 2.5yrs and 4yrs who were extremely excited. I was worried about the queue times for the rides but as we travelled outside of school holidays and bank holidays we manged to walk on most rides with a max wait time of 15mins. The park exterior is kept very clean and all the staff were friendly and helpful. The toilets however weren't great and the only advice I can offer to the ladies is the 'squat and hover' approach. We managed to go on most of the rides, the Peter Pan ride broke down twice while we were there so we didn't get to go on that. The Small World ride is lovely and my two loved it. If you get the chance then queue for a ticket to visit the Disney Princesses, my eldest was mesmerised! Its quite a queue for a ticket so get there early as they only give out so many, you are allocated a half hour slot to then go back and meet a Princess. You don't know what Princess it is until you get there. We met Snow White and it was magical. The queue once inside is also pretty lengthy but well worth it as you can spend as long as you like with her and take lots of pictures. The 2nd time we visited the park we had lots of sunshine which made for a very enjoyable time. If you can keep the children going until 7pm then you must see the parade. Its amazing. My little girl was singled out by Merryweather the Fairy from Sleeping Beauty and I actually cried when she came over to her!!!!! My husband and I took advantage of having my parents with us and returned to the park at 10.30 for the evening spectacular and OMG, was it worth going for, utterly magical. A fantastic firework and water display with the castle being used as a projector taking you on a journey through all the Disney films with Peter Pan as your guide. It was heaving with people so if you take young children with you they will need to sit on your shoulders to see. My main tips for a visit to Disney (with families) are as follows:1. The food is extremely expensive wherever you go but Disney do allow food and drinks to be brought in from outside so stock up and take a picnic, drinks and lots of snacks with you.2. Layer up and take waterproofs and a jacket. Wear comfy shoes.3. Don't succumb to the Disney paraphernalia. Its great while youre there in the thick of it all but will you really wear that Buzz Lightyear hoodie when you get home and have paid 80euros for???4. For families...take trolleys with you, you can hire the park trolleys but they don't recline and don't look comfy at all. My 4yr old hasn't been in a trolley no for a long time but we took one anyway for her and she did need it, theres a lot of walking involved and little legs get tired. 5. Take blankets, it was cold when we were there and my two had one each to snuggle under but you can also use them to sit on for a picnic or dry yourself down if its raining. 6. Take waterproofs, even if its just a poncho. Don't worry about looking an idiot...everyone is wearing them and do you care as long as youre dry!!! Brollies are useless, you need your hands free so a poncho is a great idea. Theyre 9euros each to buy in the park. 7. If you see the parade at 7pm you need to get a spot at least 40mins beforehand. Try and stand near the entrance exit as once its over you can then make an easy getaway back to your car bus shuttle. 8. For those with young children like mine, take a few toys in with you, we used them to pacify them while we were queuing. 9. Lots of little girls were walking round wearing Disney Princess dresses. They're mega expensive to buy (around 60euros) so take one with you from the UK. 10. Get a map and plan ahead where you want to visit. 11. Take a change of clothes for the kids, we needed them on a few occasions. 12. Have a brilliant time!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
161916408,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"We went to Euro Disney as part of the Sun promotion. I booked my own hotel and eurostar tickets and it was very easy. We took my just 3 year old son, and he was very overwhelmed with it all, and just wanted to look in all the shops at the disney toys he could take home with him. Food wise we didnt want to spend a fortune and found the food in the Sports bar in the village, very reasonable, quick, polite and no waiting around for a table.We did the Character breakfast in Cafe Mickey even though I knew my son didn't like people dressed up in costumes, just to see if Mickey could change his mind, but he didn't. I managed to get a cuddle with Chip & Dale, Mickey, and goofy. The one thing about this place though, was that we had to wait for clean cutlery, and there were no clean mugs to use the coffee machine so everyone was getting a bit grumpy but after 10 mins the dishwasher had been emptied and mugs came flying out. I'm sure if my son had been into the characters, I would have enjoyed it more. Food was alright though, you're just paying to meet the characters!I can't really fault anything at Disney though. The magical light show in the evening is not to be missed. Absolutely amazing, it reduced me to tears! Everything was clean, we all had a magical time, despite it being bloomin freezing.

The parades were amazing, couldn't see the Stars and Cars Parade due to the rain but instead the 20th Anniversary Parade was put on instead which was good.The closing ceremony was absolutely amazing, only saw it once and that was on my final night and it really did put an amazing end to an amazing holiday.I literally forgot all of my troubles while I was away and got to meet some amazing characters.

Most of the rides I've already known from the USA parks, but they've made some very nice improvements on some rides: the space mountain is the best version (comparing with the versions from California and Orlando), the new turtle coaster (from finding Nemo) is great, and also they've got some of the best attractions from their USA parks.. but the ending show (which they make a lot of special effects on the casttle) is a must!!

Most carried cleaning pans therefore didn't know if we could ask them. Even when we asked their english speaking and understanding was poor.4. Finally, the worst experiance was when we were travelling from Grad de Lyon to Disney land station by RER. There were no machines that accepted coins (as by then all cards had been stolen earlier). There were no info counters in that area too. A stranger helped us by buying the tickets to Disney. Unassuming and thanking the guy we reached station. When we reached there we realized that the tickets given were not valid to get out. This really broke us. Only after a lot of crying that somebody let us out.

It is free, and you can roam around instead of waiting in line. Come prepared if rain is forecasted, otherwise you'll spend 9 euros (each) on ponchos like we did. I had a great time, and Sleeping Beauty's Castle is really pretty. I didn't see as many characters as I'd hoped to, but it was pretty awesome to see Chewbacca roaming around.

Had a WONDERFUL time at Disney, stayed in hotel Santa Fe, in a 'Cars' themed room, a double bed each, en suite which was more than adequate. The park itself is fabulous, and was more of interest to our group than the studios.We travelled by coach with Newmarket Holidays, as there was a Boston pick up. However, it transpired there would not be a Boston pick up and they would put a taxi on. We requested a people carrier or mini bus as we were four adults, with luggage... a regular car arrived so we were packed in like sardines for an hour and a half to the bus at Nottingham. We felt let down by Newmarket travel as there was no itinerary, we weren't even told if we were going by tunnel or ferry!! The Newmarket rep the other end wasn't too helpful, we managed to lock ourselves out on the first night and were told to sort it our ourselves at reception. Despite paying for half board, we arrived so late no restaurants that took our vouchers were open.Whilst the actual Disney experience was amazing, I wouldn't recommend Newmarket holidays. And, take plenty of drinks with you, as everything is expensive there, which you'd expect so go prepared! Half board option well worth it, as choice of restaurants & quality of food good. We were supporting two ladies with a disability and collected disabled persons passes which means no queuing, a bonus.",Disneyland_Paris
161592197,2,2013-2,United States,"I grew up going pretty regularly to Disneyland in Anaheim, California (my family lived about 40 minutes from there). I now am pretty ambivalent about Disney and Disneyland in general. As a child, I loved Disneyland and Disney movies and characters, but in adolescence the  fakeness  of Disneyland started bothering me, and now as an adult I realize how important it is to find a variety of options to entertain children (and for them to entertain themselves), and am much more aware that spending a lot of money isn't necessary for children to have fun. The  Disney experience  is so expensive, and many people cannot afford it. We bought a three day pass for the Disneyland outside of Paris and were there in late February 2013. We stayed at a very nice but inexpensive hotel one metro stop away from the parks. It had a kitchenette (including small refrigerator, stove, microwave, tableware, and a mini dishwasher) so we purchased groceries at the nearby E. Leclerc in the mall. Preparing simple meals in our room helped us to keep expenses down. Disneyland was a big disappointment. It was unusually cold and it even snowed; we are from a very cold area in the US and so have plenty of experience dealing with inclement weather, but Disney doesn't. Many rides closed. Lines were long (waits ranged from 45 to 90 minutes); Fast Passes ran out early; adults smoked cigarettes in lines but weren't asked to stop by employees; bathrooms weren't well attended to; and overall for us adults, it wasn't much fun. I don't think that the weather was only the cause of all this. Our daughter thoroughly enjoyed herself  this was her first trip to a Disneyland and she was happy to go on the rides for younger children. She also loved meeting Mickey, and we appreciated the one on one time in the room with  him,  and the photo opportunities. So all that said: If going to Disneyland is your and or your child's dream, go for it. Be prepared for the expense. If you are on the fence about going, or are considering other options, I'd say spend the money and the time on a different excursion.",Disneyland_Paris
161590615,4,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Obviously the park is fantastic, clean, well spaced out, not too far to walk between 'lands'. The gardens are beautiful, the castle is fantastic. On our visit the thunder mountain ride was closed, the toad hall restaurant was also closed and there was a technical problem with the Peter Pan ride. The fireworks were brilliant however I think a little late starting, when you have small children who are half asleep before they start. The parade is wonderful with all the usual characters involved. Small world is lovely for very small children (and parents) Pirates of the Carribbean ride is a little very dark and might be a little frightening for little ones. Peter Pan ride is very good, but a long wait, I recommend you fast track this one, and the Buzz Lightyear ride. Food is quite basic in the park for the most part. Lots of places to stop and grab a coffee or icecream, quite pricey though. Lots of shops for buying all manner of Disney items, from the cuddly toys to kitchen wear and ornaments and jewellery. Would recommend it for children of 3 years and older.Be prepared to buy outfits (princess dresses Buzz lightyear) as this is the norm for children to walk around in.",Disneyland_Paris
161576031,2,2012-12,United Kingdom,"Very disappointed visited Disney, Paris just after Christmas. Stayed in the Sequoia Lodge which was a lovely hotel although the bedrooms are quite basic for the price.The park itself was very chaotic.. there is no queue order people just pushed in all the time. The staff were very miserable and not very helpful at all.After waiting for nearly an hour to get a picture with one of the very few characters available my child was left disappointed when they just left no explanation couldn't even be bothered to see the last of the children waiting! So much for a magical experience..Also, other times you have to push your way in to get a picture for your child because everyone surrounds the characters and pushes in.On one occasion being one of very few English families there we found it very offensive when one staff member shouted to the audience at the beginning of one a rides he asked  is there any English here?  when we answered they then proceeded to say something in French and had the audience laughing! which I can only presume was at our expense!Food and drink was way too pricey for what you get. Double over new year!I believe it is unfair how locals have very cheap yearly passes and it not available to anyone else not worth the money if travelling from uk! Will save up and go to the real Disney next and not its poor relative!",Disneyland_Paris
161574151,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,We really liked this park for small kids who aren't big enough to ride some of the more exciting rides.  It's easy to get around and has all the classics you expect.,Disneyland_Paris
161572517,3,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Having been to Disney in Florida, I was looking forward to Disneyland Paris. We travelled from central Paris and just jumped on the Red RER4 line which had about 14 stops before we got there     taking about 45 minutes or so and was pleasant enough and only cost 9 euro.The station is almost in the park itself, it   s just a short walk though security and then you can choose to go to the amusement parks or World of Disney shopping area.Although busy, there is a large landscaped area leading up to the entrance that allows a lot of people in without it appearing to be too crowded. There were large queues for tickets, but most people had bought before arriving and you just walk though the turnstile and you enter the park proper.You arrive in a large open square with a rail station just to the side of you that allows you to jump on to the more distant parts of the park. This area also has facilities such as storage lockers, push chair hire and so on. Each side of the street is lined with shops, basically selling either food and drink or Disney merchandise. Although the effect it good, it seems somewhat cynical and designed to extract the maximum amount of money from you     taking small children could end up very expensive if only buying a fraction of what is on offer. You have no choice in walking past all these shops as it   s a funnel to the central plaza.Once in the plaza, you can pass through Sleeping Beauty   s castle (this dominates the park) into Fantasy land which is for younger children featuring rides such as Peter Pan   s flight, Dumbo the flying elephant, mad hatters tea cups and so on. Moving into Adventure land, and this is more family oriented with play areas and the Pirates of the Caribbean ride and the Indiana Jones ride (this was closed due to a technical fault while we were there    ) In this area is also Aladdin   s enchanted passage and Arabian night themed buildingsMoving into Frontier land, and you have a wild west theme. The Molly Brown boat ride takes you around for a good look at the area with the Big Thunder Mountain as the central point. Thunder Mountain is a good ride, taking about 10 minutes to get on and then whizzing around the track in about 2 minutes     great fun!Phantom manor is on the way back to the central plaza and offers some mild scares.Finally, discovery land is the final area which is a sci fi theme. The Buzz Lightyear ride had huge queues with a waiting time of over an hour. The Space Mountain 2 ride was also in this area and this was beyond a doubt the best ride on there     totally dark inside with a huge rollercoaster that tosses you around. Sit well back in the seat! Waiting time for this was only short     10 minutes which was surprising for such a huge attractive. Finishing off was Star Tours which is based around Star Wars and included a huge X Wing outside.For any of the attractions, the Fast Track system is a must, and allows you to get a ticket and gives you a time to return (usually a 30 minute window). This allows you to make the queues manageable, but having said that the average waiting time was around 15 minutes or under for us and this was in a very busy park on a sunny day.A recommended tip would be to fetch your own food before you get to the park, as inside everything is very, very expensive. A hotdog was 8 euro, and a coke 3 euro. The cost soon mounts up after a few hours. The staff were all friendly enough and spoke good English. Some of the rides were good, and we spent about 4 or 5 hours in the park. There is a lot of walking involved so wear comfy footwear (and plasters!) The food was poor to mediocre and very expensive but you don   t    really have much choice other than to buy onsite if you have not brought your own. It also felt very commercial, which I have no problem with, but the prices are unreasonable, which I do have a problem with.Overall, it   s not a patch on Florida and expensive for what it is. It   s worth it just for the experience and there are a few decent rides but won   t be somewhere we go back too. Sure it would be a far better experience with young children and maybe would have got an higher score but this review is based on the visit as two adults.",Disneyland_Paris
161521022,5,2013-5,United States,"we arrived on the 15th may,we stayed for 5 days. me and my partner have visited disney 3 times befor and have always enjoyed it,hence why we return again and again. this was our first visit since starting a family and we wanted to introduce our 2 boys age 3 and 4 to the magic of disney!! ques were long as expected for the time of year but bearable,just,as a 3 and 4 year old find it hard and distracting queing for that long,but staff and cast members did really well to turn over the rides as quick as possible. however by the saturday,its the busiest ive ever seen disney,ques were 90 mins long on most rides. not do able with 2 small boys,so we decided to watch the shows where show capacity was high,so no queing involved,phew!! animaique show was fab,the boys loved it!! DISNEY DREAMS SHOW,IS A MUST. proberley the best thing ive ever seen,i cried,lol. do find a good spot a good hour befor the show as people start sitting for the show1 2 hours befor. also dont take no crap from families who think its ok to push to the front,after arriving 5 minutes befor the show,stand your ground or you will lose your spot. meals and suvoneirs are expensive,but when you look at the bigger picture and see for yourself the minor details that disney spend alot of money on to get that perfect magical look,it cannot be cheap to perform that disney dreams show everynight 365 days a year!! so dont moan about the price of things,it is worth it!!! we did meet a few characters although i did find the studios a better option for meet and greets with the characters. again,expect to be pushed out be impaitient familes who dont like waiting. no litter to be seen,and if someone did drop something,i noticed on more than 1 occasion,a cast member with a pan and brush cleaning the mess befor you even had time to notice it on the floor!! i did however notice that some attractions have lost the excitedment that i felt when i rode them 10 years ago,ie tram tours... why doesnt the lorry fall down the cliff,also the stunt show doesnt have as many stunts as i remember,still fantastic rides with these minor details missing. i did notice alot of work and restoration within the park so cannot wait to return to see what new ride or attraction they have built,i hear a new ride for the studios is underway.?? cast members always looked happy and smart,helpful and polite. cannot wait to return thankyou disney for a fab stay. x",Disneyland_Paris
161510394,3,2013-3,United Kingdom,Park is Magical for kids and adults unfortunately toddlers don't understand you have to queue for each ride for minimum 30min so it's hard.worse even when in the middle of the queue your toddler wants to go toilet...would definitely wait that kids are like 8 or 10 to go back.i can't imagine how long are the queues during school holidays or summer time...,Disneyland_Paris

161463621,1,2012-10,United States,"We are an American family living in Europe. We drove into Paris for 9 days and one day decided to do Disneyland for the kids. We decided to go on a Tuesday in Late October thinking that there would be less crowds. WRONG! Disneyland and Disney Studios is much smaller than other Disney parks. However, the lack of order and management are the real concern, but perhaps this is just a French thing? The French patrons of the park DO NOT like to wait in lines for things so people jumping the line and cutting in front of others is rampant. The park management does nothing about this, so it makes the experience unpleasant for those of us trying to follow the rules.Fast Pass. We thought that at least we could use the fast pass system to ride some things. NOPE. The park opened at 0800 and we got through the gates at 0830. At 0830 ALL FAST PASSES WERE SOLD OUT. Isn't that impossible? Can't you only hold one fast pass at a time? I guess not. I think that you can go around to all the fast pass machines and collect as many as you want right at the beginning. All the fast pass machines were being covered up and roped off when we went looking for them at 0830 0900. Ridiculous!Don't visit this park, it's just not worth it.",Disneyland_Paris
161441609,3,2013-5,United Kingdom,I visited with my 3.5year old son. The park in general was ok but so crowded and a number of the rides were not working or had 'technical difficulties' which is not fun after queuing for 40 minutes with a 3 year old. However my biggest gripe is the absolute extortionate prices being charged for food and drinks. I appreciate you are going to pay a bit over the odds for things at these types of attractions but   20 for a small fish fillet and cold chips.... every meal for 2 adults and one 3 year old cost at least   75 and the food was atrocious. At the breakfast buffet in the hotel you looked around and families were running production lines making covert pack lunches to save their pennies. We were there for 4 days. Thursday and Friday were ok but it was hardly worth going in Saturday and Sunday as invariably by the time we got near to the front of the queue either the ride broke or my son needed a wee! No plans to ever visit again.,Disneyland_Paris
161434368,1,2013-5,Switzerland,"We couldn't believe that what was ahead of us after the hassle of arranging flights, hotel stay and buy expensive entrance tickets, was two days of queuing!Every  net  minute of  attraction  (in total 6 minutes in 2 days!) cost 500 Euro and 60 minutes of queuingWhen bored of queuing we decided to eat we found out that the  queuing attraction  had been carefully planned, by very attenting Eurodisney management, also in this area.Of course we hoped that the bad weather would have reserved us a better outcome the following day at the Studios. Unfortunately we were wrong. Congratulation to the management for managing so well the consistency. We know know what to expect.We do not want a refund as it would be too costly to pay for the frustration we had to go through, What We hope is to help people not to make the decision to go through the same awful experience",Disneyland_Paris
161430997,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,Everything you'd expect from Disney. Magical from the time you walk through the gates! The parades are fantastic and a must see and the night time light show really is amazing.A note for all Disney princess fans is that you have to get a ticket for the Princess castle and come back at the specified time (we waited an hour an a half) Only to be told we could only see one princess but there were three in the castle and you do not get to choose which one you see!!!! This for us was the only thing that let the whole trip down.Other than the above you won't be disappointed with a holiday in Disney,Disneyland_Paris
161397178,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,Fantastic time had by all ages. The rides are so varied that there is lots for all ages and abilities. The food in the park is ultra expensive and unless you are travelling in from outside the park there is really no way to avoid this. We took our time and went round almost every ride in the park and could have done with another day ( we had 3 days) One of our favourite family holidays. It was pure magic!,Disneyland_Paris
161378111,2,2013-5,United States,"We have earnt a degree in queuing with even the small rides taking half an hour before you got on. We were allowed to enter 2 hours early which helped but there were still large queues. The waiting time could be reduced if staff were more efficient in getting people on and off and if the equipment was working properly. We waited an hour for a 2 minute ride on a train with one going around empty and the remaining one had 2 carriages not operating. We ate lunch twice there and the food was awful and expensive   it cost 30 euros for sandwhiches, crisps and a drink for 2 adults and 1 child.The only good experience was the show that takes place just before the park closes.I would recommend that if you go and want to go on the Peter Pan ride use the fast pass option as the average waiting time is 1hr 30 mins and it is not that great. We went years ago and it is still the same.",Disneyland_Paris
161340657,2,2013-4,Australia,"We visited this smaller version of Disneyland during a visit to Paris for our granddaughter's sake. May husband and I have visited the US based Disneyland on two occasions and had a great time, so we had high expectations. We came away disappointed for a number of reasons. It was a lot smaller although designed and based on the same as the US. It was extremely crowded. There were not enough food outlets and those they had were not well run and it took almost an hour to get served. There are not enough public toilets and the ones they have are not that well cared for. There was not enough shade (it was an extremely hot day) and when my 10 month old grandson became ill and my daughter asked if she could sit in a fenced off area to care for him in the shade, the staff were very rude and refused. We only got to go on one ride as the queues were far too long. I have never experienced any of these problems with the US Disneylands. They are run much better. It was very expensive and not worth the money. Only go to this one if you dont have anything else better to do.",Disneyland_Paris
161320035,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"went weds evening and hardly any ques for anything. Thursday was good too. Really busy Sat & Sun, glad we had been on most of what we wanted to. Lots of characters out and about esp Alice in Wonderland ones and 7 dwarves.Merchandise all over priced but still it flies off the shelves. We took our own food in, not a problem thou we saw one small sign that said picnic food not allowed, also no smoking allowed yeah right! (thou it didn't spoil the days)Parade is fun and light show is great. Now start saving for Florida!",Disneyland_Paris
161260842,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"My Boyfriend and I (in our 20s) visited Disneyland Paris to celebrate a special occasion. Even though we are not children anymore, we absolutely loved every second of our Disney experience, which suffices to say that Disneyland is perfect for any age. There is so much to see and do, and we were amazed at how much detail goes in to the park, there was always an amazing photo opportunity close by. We visited Disneyland between 12 16th of May and the first two days were relatively quiet (to our surprise) but the remaining three days were noticeably busier. The Sunday and The Monday, we managed to get on most rides near enough straight away with only a 5 or so minute wait. Although busier  the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday weren't too bad, the longest we waited for a ride was 25 minutes, which we were very happy with. To take full advantage of the attractions in this park, I highly recommend using fast passes where available, they will cut your waiting time in half, and will save you a lot of energy. Also, use your easy pass to gain entry to the Magic Kingdom from 8am. Those who stay in Disney Hotels are entitled to two 'extra magic hours' in the park before it officially opens at 10am. Doing this will allow you to experience the park in a quieter and more relaxed environment   and will also enable you to ride more of the attractions without the queuing. We rode Space Mountain during the 'Extra Magic Hours' and didn't have to queue at all, fantastic!The Park itself is well laid out and divided in to lands. There was something to enjoy for all ages in each of the lands and each contain notable attractions things to do. MAIN STREETCatch the parades here! The main parade is at 7pm every evening and I would advise you to arrive there early in order to maintain a good view. The 20th Celebration Train also resides there every hour from 1 4 daily. You'll be able to catch a glimpse of some characters such as Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and others. There are lots of shops in Main Street and also a few cake shops and cafes. This part of the park is also home to CITY HALL and here, you can book reservations for lunch and Dinner if you haven't already done so at your hotel. We found the staff in here to be very helpful and friendly.FANTASYLANDThis area of the park is mainly themed around fairy tales. The main attraction is Sleeping Beauty's castle   which we thoroughly enjoyed. It is so beautiful inside and out and should not be missed, don't forget to catch the sleeping Dragon beneath the castle! Other attractions we really enjoyed was Alice's Curious Labyrinth and It's a Small World. There's lots of things to do for little ones too, such as Dumbo's flight and the Tea Cups. Also, don't forget there is a chance to meet Disney Princesses and Mickey at specific places in the park (meet and greets)DISCOVERYLANDWe loved this area of the park as it is home to Space Mountain   one of our favourite rides. The land is mainly space themed and includes some great attractions. Buzz Lightyear's Lazer blast and Star Tours are not to be missed!ADVENTURELAND We really enjoyed this land. there are lots of things to see and do and lots of photo opportunities such as The Pirate ship and Tarzan's tree house. The Indiana Jones' Temple of Peril ride resides here, and if you are a thrill seeker you will certainly enjoy it! The Pirates of the Caribbean ride should also not be missed, it was lots of fun! The Blue Lagoon restaurant is also situated next door to the Pirates of the Caribbean and I would definitely recommend a meal here, it was gorgeous, one of our favourite places to eat in Disneyland!FRONTIERLANDWe loved the atmosphere in this land! It had a wild west Cowboy and Indian style theme running throughout and every detail from the buildings to the attractions was fantastic! We loved Big Thunder Mountain and the Phantom Manor and we enjoyed a short cruise around the land aboard the Mesa Riverboat! We also ate in a restaurant called The Lucky Nugget Saloon and we are very glad we did! It was a good meal, and the cheapest of our stay! Don't forget to stay in the Park until closing time to catch the amazing 'Disney Dreams' show! I recommend getting to the castle a little earlier in order to secure a good spot. The show itself was spectacular and we couldn't believe what they did with the castle, it really was breath taking! Lights, water projection, music, fireworks, it was just beautiful. Characters wander around the park at various times of the day but whether you get a picture with them, or their autograph really is hit and miss! They are bombarded with crowds and getting to the front is a mission and a half. We managed to meet a few of the characters but only did so by luck! Be aware, lots of people push their way to the front and will happily push anyone out of their way to meet a character   especially the most popular ones such as Donald, Daisy, Pluto etc!Food and drink in the Disneyland Parks are very expensive and we were aware of this before we visited, so we ensured we took plenty of money and we were happy to pay the prices because it is not everyday we get to visit Disneyland Paris and because we were celebrating a special occasion, we decided to treat ourselves!We had such an amazing time, and we will definitely return, hopefully around Halloween or Christmas when they decorate the parks! We're already looking forward to it! :)",Disneyland_Paris
161246916,2,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Overall this is not the same magical experience as the Disney Parks in the US. We had an OK time, but would not spend the money to go back.Positives: We really enjoyed the parades Nice to get into the parks 2 hours early, if you stay in a Disney hotel (note not all the rides will be open) During the early hours can get on some rides, like the teacups, without queuing  Has classic Disney rides like teacups, flying dumbo and magic mountainNegatives: Outrageously expensive Very pushy people in the park, especially at character appearances Lots of smoking   everywhere Dirty and run down Long queues and lots of broken or temporarily out of service ridesTips for a good trip with small kids: Bring water bottles in the bottom of you push chair or in your diaper bag (they looked at the bottles and did not say a word) Easy to bring in snacks for the kids (adults too) fruit cups, crackers, crisps, chocolate buttons etc.    kept the food cost down (at the gate they just asked if these were for the kids and said OK or said nothing at all) There are only a few baby changing facilities, so locate them ahead of time on the map Lots of walking, most kids under 5 will need to spend some time in push chair The train station has a little shop where you can find essentials from cough drops to light snacks and wine (at much cheaper prices) (if you get wine just take the shuttle back to the hotel)",Disneyland_Paris

If you are tired of all the scooters running over your toes at the US parks, you wont have that problem here. If you want great service and excellent hospitality, Disney offers that in abundance.

161157333,2,2012-6,United States,"We were in Paris for 8 days with our children. Most of our time was spent exploring nooks and crannies of the city or visiting the big sites like the Orsay, Sacre Coeur, and others. But on a lark we decided to try out the Paris Disneyland. Our family is from Southern California, and we've enjoyed numerous trips to Disneyland in Anaheim. We thought it would be a fun addition to an already spectacular stay. We did find ways to enjoy ourselves at the park, but it really took a lot of work. The place simply isn't up to the standard of the US parks, and our time and money would have been much better spent enjoying even more of Paris or the French countryside. I will concede that there are a few bright spots in this park: The design is a nice European update to the standard look of the US parks. The layout is very similar to the US parks, which makes navigation easy. The Space Mountain in Paris is a much better roller coaster than either of the US versions, too. My kids wanted to ride that one all day. But there were several things that just didn't sit well with us:1) Disney parks in the US are obsessive about cleanliness, order, and friendliness to families. Not so in the Paris park. First, there was cigarette smoke everywhere. I get it. We're in Europe. People still smoke a lot. But in a Disney park? Second, there was graffiti everywhere. Third, just like in the old, broken down amusement parks I used to sneak into as a kid, stairways and hallways smelled of urine. Needless to say, the smoke graffiti urine combo made waiting in lines less than pleasant.2) There simply aren't as many rides as in the US parks. The usual suspects are there  Pirates, Space Mountain, Autopia, Peter Pan. But after exhausting those, we went looking for other rides to enjoy, and there just weren't many options. The slim pickings also meant longer queues, with more folks waiting for fewer rides.3) It's suprising to say this about any establishment in France, but the food in the park just wasn't good. The candy apples and other foodstand options were mediocre, and the sit down meals were not much better. The one exception was the cotton candy stand right around the backside of the castle. It was the best cotton candy we have ever eaten anywhere. It's as if they took all the Disney magic out of the rest of the park and poured it into that cotton candy machine. Since our trip, I've spoken to a few friends who have visited the Paris Disneyland, and they all reached the same verdict: A few fun Disney bits, but a pale imitation of the real Disneyland. All of them agreed that they wished they had spent their time doing something else.",Disneyland_Paris

161124416,4,2013-5,Ireland,Brought my 3 and a half year old here recently. We both loved  its a small world  and went on it a few times to take it all in. Another big hit was the  Mad hatter tea cups  and also Casey Jr.   le Petit Train du Cirque( all of these were in Disneyland park at the fantasyland side of it and suitable for my daughters age group. The queues for the food in a nearby restaurant were ridiculous!I would advise bringing a stroller( they are also available for hire here) as i had no idea how much walking around we would be doing and ended up lifting my little girl everywhere which was quite tiring. My little girl spotted another child with a Minnie mouse balloon and just had to have one. I reluctantly paid the 7.50 for a balloon which i felt was quite steep after paying 180euros for 2 adults and a child to come. Overall it was a wonderful experience if not a little expensive but i justified it to myself that this was a once in a lifetime experience.,Disneyland_Paris

What I like most though is that eventhough it rained every thing continued smoothly and the parc seemed to carry on quietly. STRONGLY recommend you stay for the 19:00 parade... and the closing ceremony at 22:00 its unbelievably marvelous. This year they are celebrating their 20th anniversary a lot of surprises during the day.. Enjoy :)",Disneyland_Paris

It will take one whole day of entertainment for the kids . you have to get up early to go there . most of the times its busy . You have to queue for half an hour or longer to be able to play one of the games . Lots of restaurants in the park . buy your tickets from the hotel , its much cheaper .",Disneyland_Paris
161091651,3,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Our trip was May 9th   13th family of 5 (Wife, 4yr old daughter, myself and my parents)Arriving just after 2pm we checked into the hotel and returned back to the park just to have a look around before getting a full day in on the Friday. First impressions were good, the park is a good copy of the US parks (I've been to the one in California well over 20 times so I know it very well) After spending a couple of hours we returned to the hotel (Santa Fe) as my mum has trouble walking (uses a walker) we waited for the shuttle bus. This was our first taste of just how RUDE the Europeans can be (I don't want to point fingers but it's mainly the French) after the 15 minutes wait the amount of people wanting to get the bus was pretty big but we were at the front waiting in the disabled area so didn't think this would be a problem, how wrong can you be, we were pushed out of the way (me holding my 4yr old) my mum struggling to step into the bus, I just couldn't believe the people around us showing no respect for the less abled people. This was like it eveytime we used the shuttle, my mum dreaded using it if it was busy.Friday was our first full day in the park and the rudeness continued, what was worse it was coming from the Disney staff members. My mum decided to hire a wheelchair (50 euros a day, 150 euros deposit) she was told to go to city hall to get a pass which would allow her and one other member of the family to go on the rides at the exit. So went to city hall only to be told that she must provide proof that she is disabled, she's not officially disabled so she doesn't have a badge or letter from her doctor, so they refused to give her the pass. So if you   re thinking of hiring a wheelchair then make sure you have a letter from your doctor to get the pass.The rides are great although the Q times they advertise at the entrance you might as well double, 25 mins for peter pans flight turned into an hour. There was one thing that really made me mad and that was constant people smoking in the lines, the park operates a no smoking policy allowing 11 smoking areas around the park, the amount of times i had smoke blown in my direction, and it was clear the staff didn't care either.We left the park during the afternoon, when returning I was helping my daughter through the barriers, when me and my daughter were pushed aside by a member of staff so she could put through the tickets of a couple because their child was in a pushchair, there was no need to rush them through, they could have waited like everyone else, to say I was angry was an understatement, this is supposed to be a magical place yet so far I   ve been pushed around, treated like rubbish and being turned into a passive smoker. I was staring to realised if you can't beat them join them, so apart from taking up smoking i started treating people the same way as I was being treated, this seemed to work and the day got better. We wanted to watch the Disney Dreams show that started at 22:30 so found a good spot at 8pm and waited, by 21:30 people were trying to push their way in front of us even looking at me and shaking their heads because i wasn't letting them in front, you just have to be strong and stand your ground, the place is big enough so everyone can see the show. It was a great show on the castle and is a MUST see.Saturday we went into Disney studios (see other review) coming back into the park for dinner. Sunday was so much better, being a weekend I thought the park was going to be really busy but is wasn't if anything it seemed empty, we got to go on loads of rides and had a great day, my mum decided not to hire a wheelchair with all the hassle from last time and just used her walker, when we tried to go on some rides staff stopped her and asked for her pass, when we said city hall refused to give her one they called down to the operator on the ride who always gave her the ok for her to proceed, we got to do things as a family which we couldn't do on the Friday. The parades were great, 20 year anniversary every hour from midday (this is a little train that stops in front of the castle and all the characters get off and meet all the kids for 20 mins before getting back on and heading down main street USA) The other parade is at 7pm.To sum up, would I go back, only if I had to, I'm now looking at going to Disney in Florida, Paris is good but to have every ride in French, if you can't understand the language you   re just wondering what is going on. Yes sometimes you get the odd bit of English but it's not enough. Every now and then i thought this is just like the US Disney, but the French just killed it for me.I will go back one day, my daughter absolutely loved it and we did see a lot of characters, I would have rated it better if it wasn't for the rude staff and the people smoking everywhere, the park should police this more.TIPSBuy the meal vouchers when booking your holiday, food is expensive, the buffet meals cost 26 euros for adults and 13 for kids. If you do get the vouchers pick your restaurants and book a table as they will fill up fast, we booked our tables at the reception desk of our hotel. I got a great tip from trip advisor, I took an empty water bottle and just filled in up at any of the water fountains that can be found at the entrances to the toilets. Saved buying water or soft drinks and saved money.Take lots of spending money, the shops are fantastic, between the wife and daughter we nearly had to buy a new suitcase.",Disneyland_Paris

Pirates of the Carribean a must and the restaurant inside it a must please book this as the food, service and atmosphere is amazing with a special thank you to Alexandro who made it extra special. Down side to the park is food and merchandise is extortionate so be prepared with plenty of sending money. The parade, fireworks show is unbelievable so magical. Lovely thing is all the Disney characters walk around the park so you can get photos with them and autographs. A must place to visit.",Disneyland_Paris
161053710,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"The park is amazing, the small details are all there, the flower beds are perfect, the place is clean & its just a wonderful place to go.The only bad thing is the smokers, seriously an annoying thing where people don't care about blowing smoke at young children. The characters pop up here & there without any lines so on a few occasions we waited for our turn while others pushed in & then we missed out because they had to go. The princesses are locked away so you have to get a ticket to see one but you don't know which one so sadly the princess my daughter loves the most wasn't seen.",Disneyland_Paris
161048511,5,2012-7,Germany,"I love all movies and fairytale heroes of Disney and to be in this park was the most wonderful experience for me. I traveled with my boyfriend last summer   July 2012, to visit Paris and I insisted to go to Disneyland. We bought online tickets for two parks   Disneyland and Disney Studios, but we didn't have enough time to visit both. The park was very beautiful and everything were on the right place to make you feel like you are in some fairytale. There were many people with their family and that's why the queue for the attractions was very long. We waited min 30 min. for P  ter Pan attraction, which lasted about 5 min. But although this little inconvinience the atmosphere were great and there we felt like we were in some magical place where live the fairytale heroes.

160972387,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Disneyland Park offers a wonderful time for those with families and also for those that do not yet have children. I would definitely recommend taking a pushchair if you have small children as there is a lot of walking and generally being on your feet. Our children enjoyed meeting various Disney characters, who were both wandering round the park and also at specified meeting places. They are a wide variety of rides for people of different ages, which we all enjoyed very much.The parade was a lot of fun and the children had a great time waving at the characters. The Disney Dreams show at 10pm, featuring projections onto Sleeping Beauty's castle was spectacular and something not to be missed.There are a good variety of restaurants around the park and also with the many shop located on Main Street USA, which is just inside the entrance.We will definitely be back!",Disneyland_Paris
160957477,3,2013-5,Australia,"First time at a Disney Land and what better day to go than on my birthday. The weather was a bit drizzly but the rain held off and didnt really effect our day. Only thing that got annoying was that the lines were still 60 min waits and it was off season, we realised that this was because quite a few of the rides where temporarily shut due to mechanical problems and opened later on, i wish there were a bit more thrilling rides in the main park. The guy in the ticket booth was lovely to us, we had a great chat! Food was good, i like the idea of the set menus. The world of Disney was really brought to life and i also liked the second park as well! The parade was great but a few more floats would be nice. Overall a great birthday topped off with planet hollywood for dinner.",Disneyland_Paris
160922293,1,2013-5,United Kingdom,"Is this really Disney ? The parks look very run down and Poorly run. Nasty rude staff ( on the whole ) unwilling to help, poorly managed queue lines, poorly run attractions, many breakdowns while here, at one point I was evacuated from phantom manor without any explanation or apology. I was made to move on another ride to make way for a family of four again no explanation just told to change WHY ? There is absolutely none of the Disney magic that I love. In my opinion it is a very poor relative of the USA parks. I strongly suggest that people save their money and visit the us",Disneyland_Paris

I still get just as excited about our trips and have terrific memories which will last a lifetime, as do friends we have visited with for years. The parks are such fun and we have stayed at several of the Disney hotels and partner hotels which really top the whole experience off. Im taking my husband for the first time this year and I am so excited   no matter what age you are Disney is amazing. The only downside is that food in the resorts is expensive as is alcohol, but it is not somewhere you need to drink, after a long day in the parks and a meal at Planet Hollywood or Rainforest Cafe bed is most welcoming without a nightcap!",Disneyland_Paris

160766971,5,2013-5,India,"The kid in me always wanted to go to some or the other Disney park for years. The mere sight of the Snow White castle gave me goosebumps and I am sure that would be true for all first time visitors to Disneyland. We visited the both Disneyland and the Disnet studios next door, which surprisingly many people miss out. All the rides in the park were good, but the ones that stood out were the Frontierland train ride, the space rocket roller coaster and the Indiana Jones ride, which our friends enjoyed and we missed because the Fast Passes for the day for these rides were over. The Pirates of the Caribbean and Peter Pan were easy going but wonderful rides that should not be missed. There was a lot of ultra expensive merchandise up for grabs. The food was expensive, but that was expected. The small but sweet Disney parade at 7 pm and the fireworks show around closing time also should not be missed. We missed the latter unfortunately as the show was late into the night. The parade was surreal as we could see all the characters we have grown up with, dancing and celebrating right in front of our eyes. There was a lot of waiting involved, more so as we did not get any Fast Passes for any of the rides as mentioned earlier. The best way to enjoy this place is to book a hotel inside the park and enjoy the park over 2 days so that one can walk around light and also enjoy the place fully at one's own leisure. The train station is a few paces from the Park, but the frequency is not that good, so the train can get really crowded on the way back. Nevertheless, one has to visit Disneyland at least once in his or her lifetime.",Disneyland_Paris
160700893,4,2013-5,Netherlands,"Visited over 4 days with a 5 year old and a toddler. It was much busier on the public holidays then at the weekends. Staying at the hotels gives you access from 8am to the park, although not all sections or all rides are open. It also means you get to the Fast Pass machines long before the park opens to the general public, so you can save yourself time later on too. Fantasyland was by far the busiest area, but probably not the best experience for our family. We enjoyed the quieter sections of Adventureland and Frontierland   especially the playgrounds which didn't require any queuing (!). The food is expensive and the queues are long. We took a picnic and it was fine, but you are not technically supposed to bring picnics in.",Disneyland_Paris

160569739,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,"With a little bit of planning and research on the rides you wish to enjoy, you could cover maximum rides by avoiding queues. We took advantage of the fast passes available on the rides with long queues and covered the big & major ones in the first half of the day. The Big Thrills are a must!! (Indiana Jones & the Space Mountain).In the second half we could enjoy meeting the toons (they also have specific times for the visits..so ensure that you remember the time & place to catch them!!) & visit the sleeping beauty castle and take ample photographs.It is impossible to cover all the rides, but we covered 3 4th of it in a single and were satisfied. Obviously it was impossible to cover the Disney Studio's in the same day.Disney brought back the memories of the all the toons we watched & loved as a child and brought joy and smile to our faces at the end of the day!!If we could enjoy so much I am sure every child will Love it!",Disneyland_Paris

160263507,4,2013-3,India,"We visited Disneyland Paris in Mar this year. From Paris its a 45mins train ride to Disneyland. As soon as you board the train you realize that all your co passengers are Disneylanders. :) Gives you that mood of fun & frolic then and there.If you haven't pre booked your tickets you have to buy them. We had not pre booked them. But it did not take us much time. I think about 20mins in the queue and we got our tickets. Suggestion:  Try to leave a little early from your hotel and reach Disneyland by 9am 9.30am. Its a huge place and you would most def need time. Also, do not try to cover both disneyland park & the studio the same day. You would have to rush with one. We just visited the park and took the entire day to cover it. Also, as soon as you get the tickets and enter the park, remember to take a map. Without a map you are lost! Half the things wont get covered as you would be hinting for places. So Maps!You enter the park & you are like Where were you all these yrs. As a girl I was over excited like a 5yr old. My husband too was. You enter and get to see the Sleeping Beauty's castle. :) Alice is waiting for you. So are Snow White, Aladdin, 7 dwarfs, rapunzel, Cindrella and many many others.Rides:  The rides are super duper crazy. If you are not scared you would have major fun! Some of the scary rides were:  Mission Space Mountain: Mission 2, Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones et le Temple du P  ril & Pirates of the Caribbean. Dont miss these. The queues for the most popular rides are really long so save time by getting your fast track passes for these rides in time.You would get food inside but you can also carry our own sandwich. :) All in all major fun!

160150443,3,2012-12,United Kingdom,"This review relates to a visit to Disneyland Paris between Christmas and New Year. Overall, I was disappointed that my expectations were not met and I felt the experience was sadly lacking in a number of areas which I feel must be rectified if the Disney brand is to maintain its reputation and indeed, it's integrity.This was my third visit to the Paris resort (I have also been to the Florida resort twice). Visiting between Christmas and New Year I had high expectations from the Disney magic I have become used to. I have to say that many aspects did live up these   the huge Christmas tree and decorations were stunning and the snowstorm was enchanting. However, I found the crowds to be unbelievable   surely there comes a point when the Disney experience takes precedence over corporate greed? The problems of so many people crowding into a finite space and all jostling for a relatively small number of attractions was exacerbated by the lack of control by Disney staff. In general, there were not enough staff available, particularly at night and in many cases, staff didn't seem interested or bothered about the visitors   one example of this was when we boarded the Disney Railroad train at the Discoveryland Station. When the train pulled into Main Street, many people got off, and my party of three people had a carriage to ourselves. No staff bothered to check numbers of empty seats, so the train pulled out of the station leaving an enormous queue, which my experience suggests would have included people who have already been waiting for more than an hour. Unfortunately, this laissez faire attitude prevails amongst the staff   we went to watch the EO show, which turned into a farcical waste of time. Having queued to get in and been forced to stand up through a 10 minute advert and boring  making of...  documentary (not welcome having been standing up in the queue outside for some time), we were eventually herded through to the auditorium. After several minutes a staff member appeared on stage to tell us rather rudely that the film would not be going ahead and that we were required to leave. No apologies or explanation were offered at all.We had planned to use our Fast Pass on the Big Thunder Mountain train   until we saw that it had broken down halfway up the mountain and that those people on board had to get out and walk back. Other substandard rides included the Phantom Manor, where the cars stop unexpectedly;  was also the case for the Snow White ride. The Buzz Lightyear ride was good, but the experience somewhat spoilt by the shabbiness of the areas leading into the ride itself, with litter and mud across the floor. We also stood in a queue for the Toy Soldiers Parachute drop, watching people carefully sidestep a pool of vomit for around forty minutes, which staff evidently could not be bothered to clear or cover up. I would very much have liked to have been able to comment on the Crush's coaster   unfortunately the two hour queues every time I attempted it prevented me from experiencing it   again, far too many people.There was a high volume of litter throughout the resort, which is not something I would expect of Disneyland. The regular  parade  was a bit pathetic with only one float and a few dancers and information relating to the daily shows and other events was simply not widely available   and again, there were no staff around to ask especially in the evening. Even if there had been, I probably wouldn't have been able to see them as there were so many missing   broken street lights around the main square.Finally, I found the excessive pricing throughout the resort to be shocking in the current economic climate. As stated, I have visited this resort twice before, so knew what to expect, but feel that prices have soared, while in the case of the Blue Lagoon restaurant, quality has declined and my top priced set menu main course was inedible and returned to the kitchen. Some other examples of rip off prices are 12 euros for a cocktail, 30 euros for a child's nightdress and 3.50 euros for a small carton of popcorn   these prices have got to be amongst the highest anywhere in the world!",Disneyland_Paris

Most rides are also manned by very inefficient staff, who could really do a much better job in filling the rides and thus reducing the queues in a big way. The kids had a fabulous time, so that helped. But one cannot help wondering why this park is loosing money. The path to profitability should be via price rationalisation (versus     5 for a small beer), friendliness (train the staff), and efficientcy (train the staff).Still think it was a huge mistake to put this Disney resort in France...",Disneyland_Paris

159966207,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,"This was our 4th visit to Disneyland Resort in Paris, however, it has been 9 years since our last. DLP is the best of the Disney parks in my opinion, have been to all worldwide except the ones in Tokyo, which I have heard are excellent. The theming and rides are top notch! The downside was the food service, which had minimal selections with many venues closed and the information provided in the map was incorrect. This was a bit maddening, as we walked a lot only to find closed restaurants. Overall I would have given a 5, but the restaurants closures, and a few rough edges in the parks, including some employees caused me to give a 4. I would highly recommend a visit though, a whole lot of fun for the family. Some of the attractions are the best examples at any Disney park. The classic rides are top notch, like Phantom Manor, Pirates of the Caribbean, Big Thunder Mountain, much of Fantasyland and Space Mountain!

Ludicrous queues for everything, including the ghastly food (80 Euros for a foul buffet for three with three soft drinks, all of which we had to choose and pay for before being allowed to sit  and I gave up another lunch in Paris for this?) on what was allegedly a quiet ish day. Epitomises everything that is wrong with Western consumer society (and from a card carrying red in tooth and claw libertarian free marketeer, that really is saying something).You really want to do something for your kids?

159908090,3,2013-4,United States,"So, I grew up in SoCal with Disneyland as my backyard playground and have always loved it. I have many Disneyland obsessed friends and while I was in Paris in April, I decided to take one for the team (plus I got in free)! While it is part of Disneyland themed parks, it is distinctly French. I absolutely loved their Pirates of Caribbean and the Indiana Jones (my fave at Disneyland) ride in France is so different being a loop d loop roller coaster but I liked it. We went on a weekday and it rained off and on throughout the day so the lines were super short  5 10 minutes. The food that I had was the worst 12euro burger I've ever had (the equivalent of $1 Burger King or McDonalds burger) but they don't have lockers or allow food so you're stuck unless you leave and come back.

159896340,4,2013-4,Czechia,"Was there and in the nearby Disney Studios Park with our 8 years old son. The queues at the most attractive attractions were sometimes very long (60 80 minutes), hence try to do a thorough upfront planning and use the fastpass as frequently as you can.Some of the rollercoasters appeared almost insane to me, but our son loved them all. Hence, I paid the price of teasing my stomach for his pleasure : ).We spent 1 entire day in the Studios and 1 entire day in the main Park, and it's fairly enough, in my opinon. Forget you manage to visit all attractions, though, unless you spend 4 days there and fall down from a pure exhaustion after that.We booked the tickets directly via Disney website and used to 20 years anniversary ticket that was cheaper than the regular price and contained both parks entry on the same day which is good also due to the fact that the Studios close much earlier than the Park, so that we walked over from one to another after the Studios closed.",Disneyland_Paris

159766075,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"A magical place, where fantasy becomes reality! I decided to take my  little princess  there so she could meet all her favorites caracters (who she thinks are real ) but this park is more than that, it  s a world that by the end of the day although you  re tired you dont want to leave.. it  s totally worth it to wait 1h in lines .. i would love to go back again!",Disneyland_Paris
159731830,3,2013-5,United Kingdom,"What a let down! The worst visit to this park since it opened and there have been plenty. I have been to all existing Disney parks   California, Florida, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Paris. Having been and enjoyed a birthday tea party four years ago it would have been nice to do the same again but they have stopped doing the tea party and only have on offer more expensive options which are too expensive when travelling as a family of 8. Let's hope the new park in China will be better when it opens in a couple of years.",Disneyland_Paris
159687857,1,2013-5,Croatia,"Too expensive, too ordinary, too booring, dirty and not well designed. Very hard to navigate around. Eating places very mediocre, as you would expect well overpriced.

Don't go there!!!",Disneyland_Paris

159634691,5,2012-6,Norway,"I've been to California and Florida, Florida is the all time favorite! Still, I love Disneyland Paris! I've been there three times, and will go backFirst time we stayed at Explorers Hotel, which is outside the park. Nice hotel, but to long with shuttle bus.So the next time we stayed at Disney's Hotel Santa Fe, a simple hotel inside the park area. Just a short walk to the park. Simple, but nice.All three times I've been traveling with my sister and her three kids. And me and my sister are like most female. We LOVE to shop! :) So at our last stay, we booked a apartment hotel at Val d'Europe. Here you find La Vall  e Village, outlet and a huge shopping Mall. It's a 5 minute train ride from the park.We stayed at Residhome Val D'Europe, and I will not recommend it, dirty and bad service. But we'll stay at Val d'Europe next time as well, just at a different hotel apartment :)The train line ends at the park, and Val d'Europe is the stop before the park. Paris is about 50 minutes from the park. Red line, easy to access :)",Disneyland_Paris
159629032,4,2013-5,Greece,"I am not a theme park guru, and waiting about an hour for every attraction might be considered normal by most people or that paying 280 euros for entrance for a 4 person family might be the usual case, but I am not sure it is normal. Then park, of course it great, perfectly taken care for with no signs of wear (I mean after 20 years). Probably, it is the best theme park in Europe. Tip: immediately be one aware of what fastpass is. It will get you into more attractions. Also, during e end of the day the ques are diminished. Expect to stay until very late to do more attractions.",Disneyland_Paris
159450327,5,2013-5,United Kingdom,We went there by car. There is car park in the building which is not that expensive (considering it is more safe). Then we need to walk about 5 minutes to the main theme park. The theme park cost me 50pound per person. we really enjoyed ourself in there. a great destination for ur lil ones!,Disneyland_Paris
159446030,3,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Before we went, I must admit that I was not a theme park fan, over expensive and queues till the cows come home. Our trip to DLP did run very smooth from flights to hotel to shuttle bus, and yes the park is a bit saccharine sweet and very artificial. But on the positive side, the queues are managed well, and you can take advantage of the fast pass option. The down side is the food. The food is expensive and lot's of the eateries use heat lamps to keep the food warm, I mean we gave our order and two minutes later there it is, freshly cooked no, piping hot no, expensive yes. Be warned, everything comes with chips. Want fruit, take a train to Val D'Europe five minutes away. The shops are what you would expect, lots of them and again expensive, but nobody twists your arm to buy the products, but you have to eat.I would go again, but I would be armed with a better knowledge of the do's and don'ts.",Disneyland_Paris

We were there 28, 29 and 30 April, it was very busy in the park. We were staying in the empire State Club in hotel New York, were we got a VIP fastpass, a big advantage when the parks is full. For example: waiting time for Peter Pan was 60 minutes, whit our passes only 10 minutes, the same goes for Buzz, Star tours, Big Thunder Mountain etc. We love the parks, we have been there around Christmas, Carnaval, in April May and Halloween and all those times are great. The parade was very nice and Dreams at the end of the day was fabulous.

159320947,4,2013-4,India,"Dos1. Min. 3 days are necessary to cover Disneyland... more time should be calculated if there are younger children : )2. A hotel within Disneyland district is better option   than hotels outside (even though most provide shuttle services). It gives you much more flexibility and comfort3. If you have an infant   say less than a year   better postpone your visit to Disneyland until he can walk : )4. For this year, buy online tickets with 20% discount (20th anniversary ticket)   this option is available only online5.

Preferably don't mix up Paris city trip with Disneyland   it makes things a lot complicated",Disneyland_Paris
159278052,5,2013-3,United States,"As a (now) International Disney geek, I can say with an informed opinion that the park by far exceeded my expectations. This was the first time I'd ever been to Paris (or Europe, for that matter), and this was a highlight of the trip. Again, I'm a huge Disney nerd, though, so if you're not into Walt Disney World or Disneyland in the states, I'd skip this one as well.Disney owns 40% of this park (I believe, as of this writing) and as a result, you won't quite get the same level of  Disney  experience you get in Walt Disney World. You'll do a lot better than going to your local Six Flags, though  You can expect about an 80% of a WDW experience.Crowds: I went on Easter Saturday with a  20th anniversary 1 day 2 parks  ticket. (Buy your tickets online in advance to save you some time.) It was busy, but the park seemed to handle the crowds like a champ. The only line I actually waited 60 minutes for was Crush's Coaster  but that's Walt Disney Studios, and deserves it's own review. Let me put it this way  I'd attend the Disneyland Paris parks on a holiday far quicker than I would any of the WDW parks.Weather: The weather when I went (in late March) was just above freezing. Literally. They still had a lot of folks there, though. As for Europe in general, pack lightly and dress in layers.Smoking in the Park: Unlike other Disney parks, people here light up anywhere. That's a European thing I suppose, and frankly, it seemed to be better here than in most places we visited in Paris the week before. Dealing with secondhand smoke here was FAR BETTER than I anticipated. You'll have it, but it's REALLY NOT THAT BAD.Fastpasses: In the states, they give one hour time windows and have recently stopped accepting late arrivals. Here, it's half an hour, and I wouldn't be more than 5 minutes late.The Architecture of the Park: This is phenomenal, and I'd say far better than the United States. Unlike it's US fiberglass counterparts, the castle here is actually made out of real stone, wood, etc., and features an amazing walkthrough with beautiful stained glass windows and tapestries. Despite taking flak for the expense and subsequent profitability of DIsneyland Paris, Eisner didn't gimp on materials here. And it shows  everything from the aforementioned castle to the stained glass roofs of the gift shops on main street. It's all super impressive.Rides: Surprisingly, the rides here are quite different than their states' counterparts.Big Thunder Mountain: Do this first, and consider getting a Fastpass. This is probably my favorite ride in either park, and it's far better than the American counterparts. The ride is similar in some ways, but adds a lot. It's also built on an island, so there's a dark tunnel leading to and from the island. Smile for the camera  they take your picture.Pirates of the Caribbean: Better than WDW, and as good as or better than Disneyland. The lighting of this ride is brighter, and there's additional  scenes  that aren't in the US. My only complaint here is that the first  scene  of the ride should be at the end of the ride, due to the presence of fire. (Linear storytelling isn't really preserved.) The chase scenes here are better, and there's sword fighting in one of them! There's no Jack Sparrow here either (and you don't miss him). Also, they take your picture on this one as well.Phantom Manor: The facade is a clear rip off of  Psycho  and while similar to the Haunted Mansions stateside, it provides a far creepier experience that I'd argue is inferior to its US counterparts. The stretching room is probably cooler, and so is the loading area (you can actually see where you're walking), but the ballroom isn't as good, and most of the other scenes leave you wanting for more. They managed to get an old west scene into Phantom Manor which looks like it's out of Six Flags book. It's worth doing, but the rides in the US are way better.Space Mountain Mission 2: It's way better themed than the US, and it's an induction launch with an outdoor loading area. The head restraints are inadequate  if you're wearing a coat, raise your collar and try to pad the left and right sides of your head. Otherwise, you'll have a headache and your neck's gonna hurt.Indiana Jones Coaster: Actually, pretty disappointing. I can't believe Disney built this. This is not themed enough to be Disney worthy. Do it once, just to say you did it. (Surprisingly, it loops. Secure your loose Euros...It's a Small World: Totally different from the US, and you'll get a laugh at the American scene. The Parisians must think we're all either cowboys, Indians, from Hollywood, or New Yorkers.If you're a fan of Disney, and you're on the fence, go for one day. Take the RER train out there  it's super easy. You'll be glad you did.",Disneyland_Paris
159259343,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"I had the time of my life, every single attraction has a special twist to it so it's like nothing you'll ever see anywhere else. Some are very relaxing, some magical (Peter Pan's flying gondolas!), some a rush of adrenaline (Indiana Jones!) and some just simply impossible to describe   so awesome (The Finding Nemo ride was my absolute favourite!)I went the a bit off season so the waiting times weren't bad and the weather was ok, even sunny.I will definitely come back but this time I'll bring my own food, the overpriced and very limited options for meals very the only downside but to be honest we had so much fun we almost forgot about food and drink alltogether :)",Disneyland_Paris
159230920,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We had 5 days in the park this year and I enjoyed almost every minute of it. The only annoying thing were people pushing in (although they did have family already in the line). The only ride not working was Autopia and the park was busy as we had gone during zone a and b school holidays. The longest queue time that I saw was one hour but it did go quite quickly and that was with a 4 year old. The parade was amazing and Dreams was spectacular. The park really does look different when the sun is shining. Yes, the food is expensive but it is at any theme park. I found the park to be clean and well sign posted. There were lots more characters around this year and we kept bumping into them at the least expected time. A truly amazing trip!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
159174503,3,2013-4,United Kingdom,Before I review some aspects of the park which were disappointing I must stress that the four of us that went had a fab time and my 4yr old niece had a great time meeting all the characters. My review is slightly prejudiced as I have been to Disneyland Florida and the two don't really compare. Firstly I purchased tickets online through the official Disney site and was sent a letter of confirmation which I was told to present at the gates and they would give me the tickets. On arrival I queued for about 10 minutes at the ticket office to be told I had to go to guest relations to get the tickets. At guest relations there was a queue of about 14 people and I soon realised this is where people come who have problems with their tickets and as a result each person was taking a long time to get sorted out. I waited in line for over an hour before I got my tickets something I had to do on the second day as well. I saved about 12 euros booking on line but it was not worth the aggravation I had to go through at the park. My suggestion is buy the tickets at the park. In the park it was enjoyable but there didn't seem to be the variety of rides that I remember from Florida. Not many had the facility to get fast pass tickets and some of the ones that did weren't working when we were there! Food was of a good standard but very expensive! I would thoroughly recommend visiting Cafe Mickey in the Disney village. A lot of the characters come around the tables and make a lot of fuss of the children. Food is very good albeit slightly expensive. All in all an enjoyable weekend but could have been better organised.,Disneyland_Paris
159129579,4,2013-4,United States,"We spent nearly three days here. It is a fantastic experience, but very much a  you get what you pay for  type of place. Thus, a nicer meal is more expensive than a poorer quality one. You can get a pizza, salad, fruit and drink for about $15, but the quality isn't great. Conversely, you can get some fantastic food in Blue Lagoon (review elsewhere), but comes at a much higher price.We only had to queue for longer than 20 minutes once in our whole weekend there, and that was to meet the Disney princesses. Obligatory for 6 year old girls. Two hours wait was absolutely worth it though, to see my little one's face SHINING with joy.Over the weekend a number of the rides (like Snow White and Pirates of the Carribean) were closed with technical difficulties, often only right at the very last minute after we'd been queueing for 20 minutes. This was annoying   why is there no comms between the people running the rides and the general info guys in the park?You expect to pay a lot of money there, you expect to stand in queues and if you're not expecting that, you've not done your reading up. If you expect that, it's a fantastic place.",Disneyland_Paris
159115402,5,2012-12,Ireland,"We travelled to Disneyland Paris in early December 2012 especially for the Christmas celebrations. We travelled with a 3 year old and a 12month old and had a truly fantastic time. We stayed in the New York Hotel(4star)  very convenient, great food (especially breakfast), lovely festive atmosphere and plenty of opportunities to meet with the characters. The room was large and spacious and spotlessly clean but a little dated but I believe they are in the process of redecorating floor by floor. No complaints about the hotel 5 minute walk to parks! We stayed for 4 nights and had a 5 day pass with magic hours which were so handy  our 3 year old loved Buzz Lightyear and Peter Pan and with our magic hours we never had to queue for these rides and went on them repeatedly each morning until the park opened to the public. We were a little wary of bringing our 12 month old little girl but she loved it and was able to go on every single attraction except for the thrill rides  Space Mountain, Thunder Mountain etc. We had our twin buggy with us which is a must with young children, the weather was freezing but we came dressed in our ski gear so it didn't affect us at all. The 20th Anniversary fireworks show on the castle every night is unbelievable  amazing. Food, shops, etc are all extremely expensive but that's to be expected. We met Santa and had our photos taken with so many characters. We had been a number of times before without children and loved it but this was by far our best trip. We will be going back again in two years, at Christmas again. We have been at different times of the year before but the Christmas celebrations are so special, there is even fake snow falling from the sky! Tip for young children   we stocked up on yogurts, fruit, bread rolls etc at breakfast to bring with us for lunch and snacks during the day. Some excellent apps available with itineraries for different age groups which we found very useful. Disneyland is far more suitable for young children than the studios and we spent most of our time in the park rather than the studios. Great buzz in the village at night also with gorgeous mulled wine!",Disneyland_Paris
159113737,2,2012-7,Indonesia,"I went here twice.Once I went at late August, the weather was perfect. I don't mind trying all the rides and queuing for them.Then I went in March, the weather was biting cold. Walking to and from attractions is a painful chore.In any weather, I can say that there's only 6 attractions that is worthwhile for adults. And in 8 hour streak, the lines can be so bad that I get only one ride in each of those attractions.I've dine inside and can say that I regret that decision. With the same money I've paid per person, I could've added another 5 star restaurant in the city to enjoy.",Disneyland_Paris
159058744,5,2012-8,Serbia,"Disneyland is with no doubt a place where people of all ages can have fun, so it's wrong assuming it's 'just for kids' (I had people in their early 20s saying it's just for kids tho). The bad side are ofc long lines, I ended up waiting for 2hrs for some rides, and then again wasted time on some other things (for example I consider Alice's labyrinth a waste of time and I missed Indiana Jones ride which I'm still not over even if years passed). Because of these lines, you can't really do much for one day here, so pick wise if you're visiting it just for one day, as I did.",Disneyland_Paris
159008038,3,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We were really loooking forward to this daytrip, getting here was easy and we arrived early. After that all downhill. Yes it is very pretty but skillfully places you on arrival in Main Street   full of disney merchandise. Then the individual parks   long queues, not many rides for 10year olds, seh basically did a carousel   nothing special, a dumbo ride   45 mins of queuing for that, nothing else really. Stunning to look at, but nothing to ride on worth mentioning. Alot of the attractions you see on the map are ones you walk around   pretty but   well not really worth the money we paid to get in.And food   wow 45 euros for chicken nuggets, fries and a coke for three   I feel very ripped off.No disney characters walk around the park, you see them at the end of the day on the parade   and they shut fantasy land as all the fantasy land staff then become the disney characters   so not that magical at all really.

I found that between 10 and 11 was not quite so busy and also after the parade.Food and drink is expensive but take your water in and fill it up from the fountains each day. Also, take your food into the park . Fireworks and parade a must see.",Disneyland_Paris
158972674,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"I'd been to DLP before without kids and it was wonderful. It really became magical with small kids. It's beautifully sculpted and full of fun and interesting things to do. There is quality and attention to detail in everything. The staff were consistently freindly and helpful.We arranged our travel separately and planned to take the TGV from CDG airport but, not having booked in advance, we couldn't get tickets and had to take the bus. Having successfully taken the train back I wouldn't bother next time. The Disney shuttle was an excellent service, at least as easy to use and not really any more time consuming. If you make the most of the Extra Magic Hours (if staying in a Disney hotel) to get a lot of quieter time in the park it can be a long day. Don't be tempted to miss the closing fireworks and lights show: Disney Dreams. It is truly spectacular. The lights, the fountains, the music, the fireworks... just amazing. It's definitely worth an afternoon siesta (avoiding some of the busiest times anyway) to let little ones get back to see it. The evening is much quieter in the park as well.The parades were also well worth seeing and again, the music adds to the atmosphere to make it really fun. My 3 year old happily danced away the time until the cars were close enough to see properly and then waved manically at every character who passed us. Both were captured with jaws dropped at the sights.Meeting the characters was wonderful though you do sometimes have to be careful of pushy parents trying to get their kids in first. The 'minders' are good at keeping order though. We did queue to see Micky and visit the Princess Pavilion (go early or WAIT) but the others we just came across, which is great. I wish we had found more. It was hard to get smiles for the camera for the first few but after that the awe passed a little quicker.We stayed at Santa Fe Hotel, definitely the poor cousin of the pack but I couldn't fault the room, food or service in any way. We could book our meals or shows from the information desk in the hotel and the shuttle was very efficient.here is loads more I could say but I'll end with this: Plan in advance.

Managed to stay on for the fireworks show and made our way back via train as well. Try to leave as soon as possible after the fireworks show so you can get a seat on the train. It will be pack!

158748271,5,2013-4,Australia,"My wife and nearly 4 year old daughter just finished our month holiday through the UK and paris with 4 days at Paris Disneyland. Initial research on the park led me to this site and i must say i had some reservations about the park, from what i had read from some of the reviews on here.Well all i can say is they must have been very unlucky with what ever they were sooking about, because Paris Disney and the Disneyland Resort hotel where we stayed, was fantastic. I recommend staying at the hotel right next to the park. Ok, you might pay a lot, lot more than the others, but you dont have to worry about lining up at the bus stops at the various 5 or 6 other hotels that are further away from Disneyland. This saves stress and more importantly...time and energy. Remember you can go back to your room at any stage you like in the day if you are right next door and also after the night and light show at disney castle, its a short stroll home.When you stay at the park hotel, you are also given access to the park from 8am, to 10am. Its a classic watching all the other patrons roll in at 1010am, and you have already hammered Peter Pan ride 4 times, Pinocchio ride 3 times, dumbo, etc you get the idea. Have an early breakfast and get out there. Bear in mind they rotate the kids rides that are opened, for example one morning the carousel was closed, next 8am start it was the pinocchio ride.Use your ice bucket provided in your room wisely. On your floor there will be an ice dispenser somewhere to store any milk, or drinks you have initially brought with you. The reason i say this is because the mini bar items have a sensor and once removed from the mini bar a charge could occour. To rectify this though a simple phone call to reception with an explanation will set you in the right direction. But ring them first!!You get one complimentary fast pass per person ,per day, when staying at the park hotel. On top of this, your admission ticket also gets you a fast pass, but this one will issue you a time that you need to go back to the ride. For example between 1405 and 1435, when you have swiped your entrance ticket the fast pass station near the ride at lets say 1100 am. Time depends on crowds. fast passes cant be used between 1pm and 4pm, so use your hotel ticket early in morning and then before 1pm use your entrance ticket for your other one. TIP...Later in the evening you can ride your faves without anyone. We rode big thunder mountain 3 times in 30 mins one evening...and space mountain god knows how many times.Rides to get to early.....Big mountain adventure coaster. My young girl loved it. Its fast but not too fast to not include younger family members. Consider fast pass if busy. Buzz lightyear consider fasat pass. Space mountain was quiet when we were there (apr 16 to 20) so no need, but you will get a gauge on how it works if staying multiple days.on the food side of things, book your dinners on the morning of. Also the wild bills show is a great show. set out indoors around an arena, holds about 600 people, has horse riding, story of the American Indians, crowd interaction, etc. Fantastic show. We went to the california grill for tea one night. IT WILL NOT DISSAPOINT, have deep pockets....but hey its your holiday and you dont take your money to heaven with you, so treat yourself.Anyways happy holidaysJustin from Melbourne Australia",Disneyland_Paris

It does help a lot especially when there is a huge crowd   which is very normal everyday. We try to eat our meals during queue so to avoid waiting time. Also, restaurants are very expensive! We only eat in restaurant for dining with Mickey and Princesses opportunity! Staff are very friendly and value safety very highly! Superb!",Disneyland_Paris

158579137,5,2012-5,United States,"Okay, I grew up on Disneyland Anaheim, and as such, it is my home field and  1 Disney park. We have also been to WDW a few times as well. We had heard 'stories' about Disneyland Paris, and France in general, but you can forget all of that! This park is AWESOME. Larger and more spread out than Disneyland, but not a marathon like WDW. And the castle is incredible    BIG surprise in the basement dungeon kids!. And there were almost no crowds at all when we went. The lands are separated very well, and the landscaping, gardens, streams, and exteriors are great. The rides are mostly the same, although their Indiana Jones ride has a loop de loop, and Space Mountain has loops and corkscrews and is A LOT faster, most are very much the same    except the haunted mansion is very odd (French fascination with the Old West I think) the way the mansion is all on its own on top of a creepy hill with the landscaping was well done. You won't be disappointed if you go (Main street even has a real working barber shop) and if you like Disney parks, you really must go and be amazed yourself.",Disneyland_Paris
158546721,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,visited easter time with hubby and 2 kids aged 9 and 6.  had brilliant time kids loved it but food and drink very expensive.  shop prices not too bad. would definitely recommend for families,Disneyland_Paris
158544196,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We visited Disney at Easter and expected it to be really crowded, but we were pleasantly surprised. Yes, of course there were queues, but the longest we saw was 45 minutes. We did not think that was excessive for a holiday period. The characters are patient and attentive, as are all the staff. We had no complaints in that area. Yes the food can be expensive, and Disney played a blinder at Easter by mainly offering meal deals. The small carts dotted around the park selling hot dogs etc were closed, our only complaint really. If you wanted a just a hot dog or just chips you had to go to Main Street. We have decided that next time we go we shall go half board, it will be cheaper.King Ludwig's Castle is good value for a beer, they had a happy hour, buy one get one free, 1730 1900, a nice thirst quencher after walking around all day.Both parks are excellent, magical and both thoroughly enjoyable no matter what your age. It is not all about the rides. It's all about having a good time, enjoying the atmosphere and just a little bit of pixie dust!",Disneyland_Paris
158476658,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"Fantastic from the moment you arrive, a little expensive but if you only do it once then its worth it. My teenage daughter and i arrived via eurostar for her 16th birthday and we had disney express so we were able to go straight into the parks. we went in late february and it snowed while we were there making it even more dream like. If we were to go again i would leave it till around april or may so it was a little warmer but on the whole it was well worth the trip.",Disneyland_Paris
158473615,3,2012-11,United Kingdom,"I have been to Florida on many occasions before going to Paris, I think it's over priced and a lot of the staff are rude. I tried to look at Disneyland Paris as if I have never been before instead of comparing it.It's a shame they sell crappy food, there's only so much junk you can eat. I have been here twice now, Oct 2010 and Nov 2012 and I do not think I would return here. I would rather spend a little bit more to go to USA. I do think if you have never been to America you'll think it's amazing. But if you have been to America you'll think it's a little bit rubbish. It is odd to hear the characters speaking French, only because growing up your used to the English American accent. Not many parades, there's not really any characters around to have pictures taken with. It is pretty and is ok.",Disneyland_Paris
158438010,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"... that said, we thoroughly enjoyed our days here. The wait times were all approx 15 mins. The longest time we waited was for the Crush Coaster which was about half an hour. We were disappointed to find a number of rides closed though. The food is VERY expensive here so please do bring your own otherwise you'll go back broke!All in all, a lovely park.",Disneyland_Paris
158402166,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We spent seven days here and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. There are rides for all ages. If you have preschool children then Fantasyland is the place to begin. Most of the rides in this area are suitable for younger children such as Dumbo, the carousel, Peter Pan and of course It's a Small World, I defy you not to be humming the tune for the rest of the day! For older children, head to Frontierland for Big Thunder Mountain and Phantom Manor. Pirates of the Caribbean is a firm favourite, Jack Sparrow himself has a meet and greet location near by for photos and autographs. For the best character interaction without the pushing and shoving that is often to be found in the parks, it is advisable to book a character meal, pricey but well worth it. Cafe Mickey for breakfast, lunch or dinner with the more classic characters. Auberge de Cendrillon, for dinner with the princesses. It's fine dining though so the menu isn't to all kids tastes (my daughter barely touched the food here yet it was worth every penny for the characters she got to meet). Inventions Restaurant, which is located within the Disneyland Hotel, (check what time the characters are there before you turn up) is a wonderful buffet restaurant. On Sundays they have a character brunch which has a different theme each week, for our visit we had Alice in Wonderland theme. It's very expensive but, again, worth it. The thought and imagineering that has gone into these parks is quite breathtaking, the rides and attractions are well thought out and the general atmosphere in the parks really is magical.  The park does have its negative aspects, the smoking from other guests, the mobs that can form at characters and of course the prices of food and merchandise, but there are many ways you can save money and prepare for your trip, details of which can be found on the Trip Advisor travel forum for Disneyland Paris. All in all this was our second visit in just under twelve months and we (2 adults and 2 children) can't wait to go back. Oh, and don't forget to watch Dreams if you're visiting before the end of September, it's a spectacular show of lasers, light, water and fireworks centred around Sleeping Beauty's castle.",Disneyland_Paris
158367418,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Amazing place for especially for families and children. Way too big to cover in one day. But you should not miss some of the rides if you just have a day. 'Little big world', 'Meet Micky Mouse' are not to be missed. And DON'T miss the Parade twice a day I think but starts one at 5PM for sure.",Disneyland_Paris
158344313,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,"The park is in good order but it can be busy. It was clean and tidy on our visit and there were plenty of character meet and greets.As with anything in France the food etc can be very expensive.....order the child meal for all.This park is very different from US. It has a number of small touches that make it different. Find the huge Dragon under the castle? Captain Nemo' whole submarine in Tomorrowland and the caves and skeletons in Adventurland.Some of the rides are different if not better than US, eg Pirates and Thunder Mountain. Almost all were open the other day. Some toilets need cleaned.It's different you just cant make the staff act like US staff but it's a good trip and if you are careful with cost can be great fun.Change your Tesco Clubcard points to Avios and change the Avios to entry tickets, good value if you do this.",Disneyland_Paris
158262091,2,2013-4,Hong Kong,"Many rides and eateries were closed, place had a run down, neglected feel. Walk ways were like ash trays, littered with cigarette butts. Very few character appearances. Sad copy of the real thing.",Disneyland_Paris
158249216,4,2012-5,Netherlands,"We went to the Disneyland as a family with two kids (3 and 7 y.o) and our grandmother. Overall kids loved all the attractions they got a chance to visit, we were lucky with the weather in the middle of April. But we realized that for an elderly person there were not enough sitting places. In addition all the cafes were more of fast food type. And a good quality restaurant doesn't exist. However the major problem is the queues to the attraction. People spend more time queuing than having fun. We also realized that there were only few attractions for small kids, so for more than half of them one of the adults had to stay with our youngest daughter. The site was partly under the reconstruction, so this might be one of the reasons too.",Disneyland_Paris
158238151,1,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Park was dirty and not well designed. Very hard to navigate around. Eating places very mediocre, as you would expect well overpriced. dissapointed not to see Disney characters walking around. Very long lines for all attractions.",Disneyland_Paris
158210430,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We are annual pass holders and visit 2 or 3 times a year. We now also stay off site as its cheaper, but if its your first only visit a on site hotel is fabulous.,I always feel excited as I enter the park and look down main street towards the castle. Our families must do rides are: Buzz Lightyears Laser Blast (great for all ages), Star Tours, Pirates of the Caribbean, Peter Pans Flight and Big Thunder Mountain, to name but a few.Food and drinks can be expensive, so its a good idea to take some things in with you. Get there early to beat the queues and use fastpasses. While you are waiting for your fastpass time you can ride another ride and then ride with little wait using your fastpass. You can also get another fastpass as soon as the time begins on the one you already hold. So you can be in your new fastpass waiting time while riding the ride you already had one for (hope this makes sense!) All helps cut wait times down. The parades are always very good and shouldnt be missed by first tiimers. They always bring a tear to my eye. Scheduled character meet and greets are always worth the wait, you get more time for photos and no others kids in your photos. There is a Princess Pavillion and one for Mickey. These are great, you can get professional pictures or take your own and get some time on your own with the characters. The impromptu character times in the parks get very manic and everyone crowds around. Its hard to get photos and people push in. There are soooo many souvenirs available to buy. I dont think they are more expensive than the Disney store at home. Its always great to take something back with you, so in my opinion well worth it. Overall, a great day out. Highly recommended.",Disneyland_Paris
158208583,2,2013-4,Switzerland,"I worked in Eurodisney 20 years ago when I was a Student. I decided to come back this year with was my children aged 6 and 8. What a disappointment!!!!! We arrived on a very warm and sunny Sunday, probably the first one of the year. We stayed in the hotel NewYork where the check in, despite being very busy, was done in an efficient manner. All was well until we entered the park which was crowded (beyond capacity in my view). Every attraction showed between 50 and 60 minutes wait. A  fast pass  system was on offer which consisted in reserving a time slot and booking a ticket for the attraction in advance. when I went to book the tickets for the attractions, I soon found out that the earlier slot available was 2 hours later. This meant that we were not able to go on any attraction for the first 2 hours, so we decided to have a bite to eat instead but we soon found out that every restaurant (mostly fastfood that we don't particularly like) were totally packed and required a good 30 mns of queueing) we gave up that as well and looked around for somethingelse to do which did not require more than 10  15 minutes of queueing. We found a few things here and there without much interest, such as the visit of a crowded pirate ship and a dusty treehouse. It was finally time to go to to Star tour attraction. I was totally amazed to see that the film showed ( with a few effects) was exactly the same as 20 years ago. Same for the pirateship. It soon became apparent that most attractions were exactly as they were 20 years ago, nothing has been modernized and as a result the overall impression is of a dusty dated place with decors and automats that are outdated. The only available places to go without queueing are the Disney shops present all over the parc and village. I would have preferred to see more attractions and amenities and less shops. The Disney culture seems to be  milk people as much as possible with the least investment possible. ur concierge at the hotel recommended a restaurant for dinner called the Blue lagoon, apparently one of the most decorated one in the parc, it turned out to be one of those tacky places yet again totally outdated where one eat in the dark surrounded by fake coconuts and boats that are passing by and waving whilst we are eating. The food (mostly fish) was not fresh, and clearly reheated frozen food. terrible, except for the nice waiter who did make an effort and was lovely. i could go on and on with the bad experiences we had, such as queueing 20 minutes for an attraction and finally reaching the front of the line, to be told by microphone that  the attraction due to technical problems is now closed  ... There were a few good things worth mentioning though, the newest part of the parc called the Studios, were much less crowded and rather nice. the attraction in the hotel tower is absolutely great and so is the show at 11h30 which shows how to film an action movie with cars and motorbikes chases involving water fire and all sort of special effects. One last thing to mention which was also very difficult to swallow, is that despite charging 79 euro for an adult day ticket in the parc ( price for guests not staying in the hotels) There are still a lot of places where people have to pay extra, hot air balloons, giant balls on the ice ring etc...one thing is sure we will never come again, instead we will return time and again in Europa parc which in my view, despite being more expensive, offers a much much better value for money",Disneyland_Paris
158191931,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Magical. So much to see and do its hard to know where to start. We travelled with 2 children (6 & 4) and they loved every second. From the moment you walk in, you are swept up in the whole Disney experience. The old fashioned main street leads up to the castle and from there you can head off into any of the differently themed lands.Staying in one of the Disney hotels gives you access to the park for 2 hours before they open to the public every morning. It is well worth making the effort to go for these magic hours, even though only a limited number of rides are open it does mean you can get to do these out of the way with very little queuing. Whilst the queues to meet a princess or Mickey can seem long they were the highlight of the visit for my daughter. Showing cartoons on the a big screen whilst waiting to meet Mickey is a nice touch and eases the boredom of waiting.The parade shouldn   t be missed nor the hourly train journey of Disney   s main characters up Main Street. The park isn   t all about the rides. Just take time to walk round without rushing from ride to ride. Take time to take in the atmosphere and you never know who you might bump into around the corner. We stumbled on some of the characters who were out and about by accident and if you   re in one of the parks quieter areas there   ll be plenty of time for a photograph and a chat.We visited in the second week of April and the park was certainly not at its busiest. The queues were reasonable with the longest wait being around 30 minutes for Thunder Mountain whilst many others (Buzz Lightyear, Pirates of the Carribean amongst others) having virtually no queue at all.",Disneyland_Paris
158177498,4,2012-12,Indonesia,"The park is actually full of interesting attractions, however, the park was overcrowded and it took like 1   1.5 hour just to get into 1 ride.

158175344,2,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We have been to Paris Disneyland before, our last being a few years ago. We have enjoyed each visit, would not hesitate to return and we were looking forward to our first visit with grandchildren.We were there for 4 nights from 10th 14th April and experienced same disappointments each day, rides continously breaking down, long queues for everything with people pushing in and not enough staff (especially weekends), many have no interest and bad attitude.The children loved the characters when you could find them but there was no organisation for photos and signatures with everyone pushing their children to get in first and then they would leave with no warning.If you plan to go with small children then 2 nights is enough and keep them to weekdays, keep patient and keep smiling although this will be a challenge at times. If you can spend some time beforehand to be familiar with the parks with what you would like to do then this will help save some time but unless you want to pay for all day fastpass then you can only have one fastpass at time and depending on demand the time between getting the pass and using it could be up to 3 to 4 hours. We planned our last ride on Thunder Mountain with fastpass before returning home and when we got there it had broken down!! The brochures and adverts make it to be a magical place but this Disneyland has lost it's magic. I have written to Disneyland customer care (?) but not holding my breath for a reply.",Disneyland_Paris
158028906,2,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We pre booked our ticket online (cheaper and less queuing time) which granted us access to both parks. Easy enough to find your way round, however be prepared for long queues. And don't forget that you will spend A LOT. We went to Aladdin's Moroccan buffet for lunch and paid nigh on 30 Euros EACH for the buffet and a drink which FYI tasted awful. If you are wishing to purchase any merchandise, then don't expect to pay less than 20 Euros. I travelled with my boyfriend and we are both 24 and 26, the fantasy land is more kid orientated   we preferred the Universal Studio park which had bigger and better rides. Disney Princess outfits are going for 70 Euros! I read that Euro Disney loses millions each year, which I think explains the ridiculously inflated prices.

158008645,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"My friend and I visited Disney for 2 days, (Sunday 14th and Tuesday 16th April 2013) on the Sunday we stuck to the Park, it was very busy. The weather was absolutely glorious which clearly bought more people out.Although it was busy the ques for the rides weren't any longer than 40 minutes, this was for the big thrills, we didn't go on the smaller child friendly ones so can't comment. Every now and again, by the castle a train would pass with Mickey, Minnie and other Disney characters on it. To get a picture with a character was beyond impossible, we didn't even try! The kids ands parents swamped the characters so we just left them too it. We qued in Fantasy Land to meet Mickey which was worth the wait!! The parade was brilliant, there was a lot of the older films that I remembered from my childhood like, Alice in wonderland, jungle book, lion king and of course the princesses and princes! On the Tuesday we started off in the studios, the Tower of Terror was fantastic!! I was 110% recommend this. I found the studio was much more child friendly so once we did what we wanted we jumped back over to the Park and went on more rides again and had a wonder around the shops.Of course the souvenirs are pricey and so is food but its a tourist attraction, they can get away with high prices! The park does allow you to take your own food and drinks though.We ate in the Disney village, planet Hollywood was great with all the memorabilia around. We also ate at earls sandwiches which was yummy!! We did want to go in the balloon in the village but it wasn't running on the Tuesday :(Overall it was a fantastic experience, Disney truly is a magical place and is suitable for children from 2 years old to 102 years old!",Disneyland_Paris
157972480,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Firstly don't buy tickets through UK websites, use the French websites ticketnet or FNAC as two thirds of the price   quite a saving! Use the fast passes to save yourself time. Try to avoid the main rides at peak times when they are most busy, and try to get on these rides first thing or later in the afternoon evening when crowds thin out. There are rides for all ages. The parade which was at 5 pm is worth a look   simply magical for younger children. It can be considered quite an expensive day, but with planning, you will get value for money.",Disneyland_Paris

Wonderful escapism.Favourite rides are Thunder Mountain, Haunted House, Space Mountain, Pirates of the Carribean, Indiana Jones, Peter Pan and so on....! Don't miss the Blue Lagoon restaurant.

We had a great time and really felt that we covered all the attractions. 4 days in the off season is enough time and we could go on many rides atleast 2 times.Highlight was the sound and light show.The queues were manageable and it is important that you reach by 10.30 am to get the ride and use fast pass where needed.",Disneyland_Paris

157627645,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,"My wife and I visited the park 3 times along with my daughter, son in law and two granddaughters. The park was crowded even on cool wet days and mid week, with the result that queues for the major rides and attractions were often long. One tip, go early or late or during the parade (at 5.00pm) when fewer are around. Park at the TGV station, no more than the official car park, but right by the main gates. Our 5 year old  princess  loved it all and it struck me that little girls probably get more out of it than boys. They get very excited about meeting Disney characters and getting their autographs. Tips   take your own book, much cheaper than those you can buy there and if you can afford it go to one of the meals at the Disneyland hotel where many of the characters mingle with the guests. If you rely on meeting them in the park you may be disappointed as they are thin on the ground and then mobbed by children. We enjoyed the pirates ride, the train round the site, the parade, It's a small world and the shows in the Disney Studios. The tram ride was disappointing, not much to see and several of the rides struck this 64 year old as rather tame and short, especially if you queued for 45 minutes. The character actors are all very enthusiastic, but some of the staff looked disinterested and jobsworth. One refused to sell my granddaughter an ice cream at 4.45pm because she was due to close, the nearest alternative being miles away. Talking of which food is inevitably pricey and the cafes on site can have long queues just to get a coffee. Those just off site seemed better and more efficient. If you choose McDonalds (or the children do) you can order at a terminal by the entrance door and save a lot of time. It's a good day out, but not as exciting as leaders in the field and more pricey than many better planned theme parks.",Disneyland_Paris
157626604,4,2013-2,United Kingdom,"We visited Disneyland Paris in Feb 2013 for our grandsons 4th birthday .We manged to access web site before we left and got yearly passes This saved money as we got pass for grandson free.With the yearly pass this also got us 10% of all food, drink and anything bought at park. . Didn't have to queue long for any rides, and although it was cold had a great time. Only downside I would say was that some areas were not open and a couple of the rides did break down. Grandson loved meeting Buzz Lightyear and Mickey and was on Cars Ride about 10 times . This was our first trip and felt it did cater for kids of all ages (Including the adults) . We plan to go back later this year when weather not as cold and get to some of the rides that were closed Would recommend Disneyland to anyone with kids or without . We stayed just outside Park at Adagio Marne La Vallee   Val De Europe ,they give you free pass for bus that takes you direct to Park and there is large shopping centre and plenty of places to eat just yards away. Web site for this is www.ce multiavantages.com There is joining fee and you do not buy basic yearly pass but one above .These can be sent to via E Mail and you do get pass at park were they take your photo You can also purchase day passes on same site for half the price you pay at gate",Disneyland_Paris

157590617,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,"With me being a thrill seeker I always like to aim at theme parks with the larger rides. With this when we had the chance to go to disneyland I was looking forwards to the atmosphere and to try out the rides which I couldn't on our last as they were receiving maintenance, these were the Aerosmith rollercoaster and the Indiana jones rollercoaster. Once we had arrived I went on the rides that were available to us, the first I tried was Aerosmith rollercoaster as I had very high hopes for this ride and after riding it the bar was increased for launch coasters. In this ride you experience a 0 60mph (0 100kph) launch in an apparent 1.8 seconds as we were told, right after this launch you are thrown straight into a very high g force loop then straight into a half loop, after this you hit a brake run to take off some of that massive amount of speed after this there are a few camel back hills and a large corkscrew before the large brake run, overall this is possibly the best rollercoaster I have ever been on and easily the best ride at disneyland Paris. After this we went over to take on the other rides which I've already rode at this theme park. The following is how I would rate the rollercoasters at the park. Rock n rolla with Aerosmith   5 5Space mountain mission 2   4 5Indiana jones coaster   4.5 5Big thunder mountain   5 5Studio tram tour   2.5 5Rc racer   3.5 5Tower of terror   4 5Haunted mansion   3.5 5",Disneyland_Paris
157548737,3,2013-4,Greece,We visited Disneyland Park Paris on a Monday off season and still found the ques very long. Make sure you bring something to eat as everything is incredibly expensive. I found the paid parking a total rip off as we all paid 69 Euro per head for the park entrance. I had visited the park 12 years ago and found no changes whatsoever. Generally this park is only worth it if you arrive really early with your young kid and take advantage of all the rides. Definitely do not visit this park if you are in Pris for anything less than a week. Try to visit off season and only if you have young children that don't have access to any big amusement parks closer to home.,Disneyland_Paris
157536052,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,All the great Disney rides are here and it makes for a magical experience but there is a big BUT ...I cannot believe I am saying this about Disney but it is looking a lot older than 21 years! This park just isn't given the love and attention that the American parks have received and it really shows. The fact that the 20th celebration was  extended  and not rebranded to 21st celebration just about says it all. Time to get the wallet out at the Disney Corporation.The Spectacular Light Show and Fireworks are a welcome addition to round of the day so I hope they keep this as a permanent feature and the parades are always great fun to watch. However some of the staff have not been versed on the Disney Meet and Greet policy and I really miss that Florida cheer from the cast members because that is what sets Disney apart from everywhere else!Water fountains weren't working which meant we spent a fortune buying water. The food is awful and over priced so take your own packed lunch and snacks. This is France   the home of gastronomy   but if you want a decent meal leave the park and buy a sandwich from the newsagents in the train station or take the RER to Val d'Europe and eat there!Most of the restaurants in the park were closed and this was during the Easter holidays   my kids wanted to eat at Pizza Planet but sadly it wasn't open and we waited almost an hour for service one day because not all the counters were open only to find the burgers and fries were stone cold!Star Tours is in a terrible state   it needs to be closed down and upgraded   it is so sad to see our favourite ride looking so broken and unloved. We still had a great time and the kids love it but I think we should have gone to Harry Potter at Warner Brothers Studio instead!,Disneyland_Paris
157521662,4,2013-4,Ireland,We went in April. Apart from one ride   where we followed the advice of Figgy Girl (destination expert on Trip Advisor) and had to q for over an hour   the longest we waited for any ride was 15 minutes. Use Fastpass for more popular rides. We arrived at 10am and left at 10 pm having visited and gone on every ride in both the Park and Studios except Fantasyland for smaller kids.Good value and brought packed lunch so no terrible and overpriced grub.,Disneyland_Paris
157503511,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"This was a brilliant family break. The park was kept immaculate by an army of staff who were always polite and pleasant. The rides were imaginative and well maintained. My granddaughters thoroughly enjoyed every minute of our week. There was, however, a huge amount of walking involved   just getting to the park from the car park must have been close to a mile! By the time you had spent the day there everyone was exhausted. There was also the issue of the cost of food which always comes up.",Disneyland_Paris
157493716,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,The Star Tours flight simulator (based in Star Trek) was by far the best ride. Incredible. But there were long waits at all the rides. One important thing to be aware of   if you stay in an on site hotel they claim you can start using the parks from 8am rather than the usual 10am opening   this is true but most of the rides don't start until 10 so it's very misleading. We wasted a morning trying to get on things early   best we got was being first in the queue at 10.,Disneyland_Paris
157486569,5,2012-11,United Kingdom,"great hotel, good food, clean .... good parks.. 1 2 hour wait for breakfast.....great room on 4th floor overlooking the lake.....all the staff at the hotel were great and helpful.....beware though very expensive hotdogs at the theme park....",Disneyland_Paris
157481959,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,Fantasy land best for younger ones. Some queuing but if you head for the rides after the parade queue much shorter. Parade & fireworks not to be missed ! Budget food outlets limited choice found better in Disney village on last day,Disneyland_Paris
157481379,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Yes, we too enjoyed it very much. I have 3 boys of 9, 7 & 5 years old and I am sure that they will remember this day for a long long time. Before planning this trip I read all the Tripadvisor Reviews and they were so helpful and I advise you the same. We stayed at a friend   s in Paris and we visited the Disneyland Park for one day. Some Important tips;Do not go there during holiday time or weekends (Sounds stupid but). If you do, the same thing will happen to you as the most reviewers had experienced here. I went on a Tuesday and there were no long queues or people pushing around. Go there at 10 am sharp, because most people arrive a little late and you can use that time effectively.Take enough snacks & drinks with you because they are so very expensive inside. Outside food is officially prohibited but they only check our bags for alcohol.Prepare to walk a lot and be exhausted at the end. So even if your child is over the age of a push chair, I recommend you to bring one. I also took a bicycle lock with me because for each and every ride we got to leave it outside.Keep your camera ready for a long day.You can use your ticket to have 6 fast passes in the park. What this means is once you enter the park (eg. 10 am) go to the ride you want to get a fast pass and swipe your ticket into the machine and get a fixed time for the ride (eg. 11 am). Do the other rides till 11am and come back to the booked ride at 11 am sharp to avoid the queue. Like wise, you can do this for 5 more rides, so get the fast passes for the most popular rides (where the queues are expected to be long). I did not have to do this, remember I went on a weekday.I agree with other reviewers, the Disney characters are hard to find here!! So when you see them make sure you take enough pictures with them.What ever you do, DO NOT miss the parade at 5 pm. It   s magical.Fortunately, out of all the rides Utopia was the only ride which was out of order that day.All in all, it   s expensive but well worth the money.For my friends who are living around countries near Singapore, Please do not bother visiting Disney land in France, because it feels so old and outdated when compared to The Universal Studios there (I was there in 2012). There were nothing here compared to the Transformers Ride in Singapore. The only 3 or 4 D films here were Star World and Captain EO and they were so so out of date.",Disneyland_Paris
157446871,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We never get bored here, five holidays here now and we always discover something new. Great for kids and adults. Even toddlers (despite what some stick in the mud people say about young children not being able to remember it when older Scrooge ones to min!)  they will love it!",Disneyland_Paris
157444688,2,2013-4,United Kingdom,"It will always be the case, a European Disney is just there to take your money, the majority of staff just do not care, the minority would get a job in the US. The ice cream store on Maine Street staff were worse than sullen with an attitude that stank, no patience, little manners and no complaints procedure.",Disneyland_Paris
157399313,3,2013-4,United States,"It's their 20th anniversary and it felt as if the fantasy and space sections had more than 20 years wear and tear. I love France, and don't need everything to be as clean as the US or German levels, but I'd have enjoyed a fresher visual experience. My 8 and 10 year old nieces liked everything, though.All three adults in our party liked the frontierland and adventure land parts of the park better. It was still not superclean but somehow that fitted the more naturalistic scenes. We really felt a wild west town feel.....my Roman brother in law now wants to go to wild west towns in US! Especially good were the riverboat ride and the Swiss Family Robinson treehouse.Only about ten rides are part of the fast pass system, definitely worth using to avoid the queues. I read that Disney in the US may be abolishing queues altogether soon, but if they do I hope it does not involve the aspect of the fast pass system where you are only allowed one at a time, because it meant a LOT more walking, sometimes with deadlines, and I had plantar fasciitis.The pressure to spend more than the entrance fee wasn't too bad. I didn't try any of the food because my sister's family had brought massive amounts, to avoid the expense. We also didn't try any shows.",Disneyland_Paris
157388228,5,2013-4,Switzerland,"What a magic world!!! You feel like a child again. Tips : do go early and start checking your ticket to the fast pass machines (applicable for the most popular games   advice the map) that will allow you to go later through the fast pass line witout or with less waiting time. Unfortunatelly, if you go for the first time it takes some time to understand the system information on line is poor and our cashier could not explain it very crearly. If you have children aged 6 7 and more do not miss the BIG THUNDER MOUNTAIN : nice, fast, exciting, long coaster that you will feel great. INDIANA JONES is very fast (no time to think what's happening) and quite short, still worth to try it. DO NOT MISS THE 17:00 PARADE.Studios have their own ambience and you may find less people queuing if you are lucky.",Disneyland_Paris
157382519,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,this park is magic for children and so is the parade Queues are long but move quickly Food is expensive but you expect this Park is clean and tidy Toilets were ok Staff helpfull Have been twice now once when it first opened with sons and now with grandson its was magic first time for us but once youve been its not so much but for kids they love it Shows are dear to see,Disneyland_Paris

Concrete walkways cracking and missing an accident waiting to happen, then there were the public toilets , I was disgusted with the smell of urine in everyone I went to , one in particular when you go through main ent it's on the right I had to hold my breath.i filled in a complaint on line to Disney hope they listened as this was not the Disney I first knew",Disneyland_Paris
157328087,3,2013-4,Ireland,"As group leader this was my second visit to Disneyland Paris in the last four months and my 10th visit overall. On this occasion our group comprised 21 children and 20 adults (parents and chaperones). For most it was their first visit and they all enjoyed it thoroughly.However, standards are slipping noticeably. Perhaps there are fewer staff at this time of year or due to the recession. That does not excuse the bad manners I experienced from Disney staff at the start of my visit.1. We mistakenly thought our tour organizer had left us short a ticket so I purchased an additional single ticket at the group desk in the coach park. On arriving at the entrance we discovered that our tour organizer had given sufficient tickets and we now had an extra one. The ticket office refused to refund the extra ticket just bought even though I still had ticket and receipt. The sales girl referred over her shoulder to her supervisor who dismissed her with a shrug saying we would need to return to the coach park desk to discuss any refund. Rather than allow Disney to gain, I passed the ticket free of charge to the next stranger waiting in the queue!!!2. Despite the fact that the park was not busy all the queues (including toilets) were excessively long with people pushing in and climbing over barriers. There appeared to be no Disney supervision. 3. The queues to obtain photographs after the bigger rides were almost as long as the queue to get on the ride in the first place.4. A number of the rides were not operating. 5. A number of our party were stuck on the Space Mountain ride and had to be evacuated when it broke down. (Makes one wonder if there are safety concerns here!)6. A number of the restaurants were closed.7. The service in the open restaurants was appallingly slow. The food was cold, poor quality (even for  fast food ), and very expensive. Eating areas were dirty with excessive delays in cleaning off tables.8. Souvenir shops were expensive, slow and crowded as expected.It is a shame to see standards slipping like this and I hope somebody in Disney Management will sit up and take notice!!!",Disneyland_Paris
157319907,3,2013-4,Russia,"Your child may be keen to go, but it's really not very good value for money when you have to spend do much of your day trapped standing in line. And this was on a very cold April day, when the park was probably operating well below capacity.I visited the park with my seven year old daughter. Tickets bought on line at   50.00 and   40.00 respectively. The ticket covered two parks, but there really wasn't time to visit both in twelve hours.We waited for about one hour to meet micky mouse, after which my daughter said  It was just a man in a costume! .We waited more than an hour for Peter Pan: a ride that lasts less than five minutes. Here the fast pass queue meant the standard queue hardly moved.We waited about threequarters of an hour for Thunder Mountain, which is worth the wait.We waited about threequarters of an hour for Space Mountain, which is scared us both!We didn't meet the Princess, as the wait was advertised as an hour and a half, and then closed early.Elsewhere the waits were half an hour or less, when the rides were working. At one point we were trapsing from one ride with a  technical problem  to another, and then to a third!The only ride that seemed able to cope with the volume of users was the Pirates of the Caribbean, where for the later part of the day there was little or no queue. It was my daughter's favourite, even after six rides.Food on site is expensive, poor, and yet again long queues!There are better experiences for children than Disneyland (although of course my daughter wants to go back...).",Disneyland_Paris
157308179,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"had a lovely stay and really enjoyed it, if uve got young kids this is the best park to stay in out of the two! The park opens at 8am if u stay at a disney hotel, however theres only one adult ride open which is space mountain (best adult ride there in my opinion anyway) the rest are all kids rides open. Went in easter hols so was packed, didnt need fast track, if u get there early enough its not a problem queueing up majority of rides open at 10am, once it gets to lunch time ie 1pmish it gets really packed, didnt have too much of a problem with queues some peoples start pushing and poking u just be firm and tell em and your fine. The 2nd day we were there it just constantly rained not much u can do when it rains once uve done the inside rides shows apart from shop but most stuff is the same in all the shops anyway! Must see the parade at 5pm and disney dreams at 9pm, food is cheaper outside the resort in the disney village!",Disneyland_Paris
157307584,4,2012-7,Mexico,"Well this is Mickey Mouse with a difference. The French version of Michelle Mouse (as they call it) offers you alcoholic drinks with your standard Disney food fare, and it works. Since the addition the French fans from Paris are visiting in large numbers which greatly assists the revenue of the park. Euro disney has had many changes since it opened in 1991, but with a French director running the park, and new investors buying into Euro Disney things have improved considerably. The Wild West show is one of my favourites in French and English, 5 shows a day, so plenty of choice. Its a 45 minute show with plenty of action. Other attractions of this park are the charming villages nearby, like Crecy la Chapelle, totally delightful.",Disneyland_Paris
157288835,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Second visit to Disneyland Paris and just as good as first time around. Clean park, friendly staff (esp. if you make the effort to smile and to at least say Bonjour!), good rides and great hotel. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel. Yes it is expensive and probably not 5 stars as other reviewers say     but it is the best at Disney and you can't beat the magic of the characters around the fireplace at breakfast, plus the breakfast itself   excellent! If you are going for the character experience (autographs and photos) then this is the best place to see them. Quiet and orderly queues without the manic crowds on the park. In the main park avoid the food areas in the centre, near Fantasyland and head down the side malls. Much quieter, little queuing. Our best evening meal was at Planet Hollywood, followed by Rainforest Caf  . The set menu work out not too bad at all.With very young children (under 7) head to far right hand corner of fantasyland... 5min queues for some lovely rides (train and boat). Pirates of Carribean and Buzzlight year rides a must for all ages. Don't miss the 5pm float show and the firework water show at closing time. Amazing!!If you are willing to enter into the magic... and make a fool of yourself... dancing around the park and engaging with the characters then your whole group will have a fantastic time. With us were grandparents aged 72, 11year old, 7 year old and 3 adults in 40's. We will go back in a few years time.",Disneyland_Paris

I found out that this is a lovely park, with nice buildings and a truly Disney atmosphere, but there were not great attractions! Just one very old simulador, a good roller coaster (Space Mountain), fairly good Pirates of Caribbeqn and thatt's all. The rest: childish attractions (as a flying carpet) or a Slinky Dog that spins for 30 seconds.

157166138,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"I was a reluctant visitor to Disneyland, mainly going 'for the kids'. However, after a 4 day trip I have to admit not only the kids loved it, but me too.Yes, it is expensive and can get crowded; and whilst if you took off the Disney branding it would be like any other theme park. However, the fact is it does have the Disney branding and that adds a whole lot to the experience and is worth paying for. Places like Alton Towers or Legoland just can't compare. Basically, just drive in a enjoy it. The best part was just the Disney experience. There were rides for children (and Adults) of all ages. My kids favourites were: Buzz lightlight laser quest and Big Thunder Mountain. The staff were mainly friendly and helpful. The park and facilities are kept very clean and well maintained. Places like Alton Towers or Legoland just can't compare. The only downside is that the queues were long, especillay to meet the characters, but I can see why they aren't walking round the park as there would be a near riot to get an autograph. To keep the waits to a minimum I would recommend going on the popular rides early or late, and using the free FastPass where it is available. For example, the wait at Big Thunder Mountain was 70 minutes at peak around 12.00, but there was no queue at 19.00.As for food and drink, we were on a half board option, so filled up at breakfast and dinner, and just snacked at lunchtime.",Disneyland_Paris
157161164,3,2013-4,United States,"We stayed at Cheyanne Hotel, on the Disney complex 3rd April to 7th April 2013. If I am being generous I would say the rooms are in character; however, if I had turned up at a hotel in Spain on a costas holiday and they had attempted to shoehorn us into that room I would have complained. Breakfast is buns, cheese and ham. The evening meals are buffet style (  24 head) but are excellent quality   the cod in butter sauce is to die for. There are two parks, Disney Studios (more technical in nature) and Disneyland Parcs which is the cartoon fest. Great fun, plenty of walking so bring your best walking shoes and loads of queing (oodles of patience required). Very expensive to buy food, drink and goods. Couple of big tips, buy your Disney Princess dresses in the UK from Asda and take them with you, it will cost you   50 per dress to buy them on site. Similarly, go to the shops and vending machines in the train station beside the parks for your food and drink and take it in with you   it will save you a fortune. 5 days are too long, we had to break up our visit by taking the train into Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
157151515,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,"A good range of rides to cover all ages (and preferences   hubbie preferred the toddler's rides!). My son (5) loved Thunder Mountain (train roller coaster) the most, as did I. The Disney Dream nighttime light display was very well done, and would have been more enjoyable if it hadn't been so bitterly cold. Wrap up warm, layers people! However warm it is near the hotels, it is colder in the park! Take food and drinks if possible, as it does add to the cost. If you buy a professional photo (ie with Mickey) they cost 15    for one, but the unit cost comes down the more you buy. There are opportunities to take your own pictures with the characters but not at 'meet Mickey' and I'm guessing not at 'meet the princess'. The easiest way to meet characters is at cafe Mickey, in Disney Village 16    for a pizza and the characters come around to each table so no queue! The map doesn't give much info about the rides, sometimes it's not until you're in the queue before you see a description of the ride. There signpstng could be better too, but it's not that big so after a day you can get to grips with the layout ok. We went Friday to Sunday, Friday queues were upto 30mins for the popular rides, at the weekend it was 60! so use Fastpass carefully and plan well. Not sure how much the VIP passes are, but the people using them only had to wait the time of one ride before getting on the ride, so at a weekend would greatly Increase the number of rides undertaken   at least double if not triple! We were there for two days in total and didn't get everything done. But we did do Thunder Mountain twice! :)",Disneyland_Paris
157145449,4,2013-4,United States,"We have been multiple times to Disneyland Paris as well as both parks back in the US and this is by far the best show! The show starts at closing time which is when they get the ideal lighting. (Same as stateside shows). Best Seating: Main Street USA or ideally in the circle at the end of Main St between the castle and the circle. Secondary best seating: in the cafe seating areas on either side of Main Street (Casey's corner and Walts I believe). Get there early and stake out your space. You need to be about to see the front of the castle and 45 degrees to either side. The show consists of movies shots projected onto the castle, water show (line World of Color in California), fire, and fireworks. The show lasts about 30 minutes. It is truly a must see show.",Disneyland_Paris
157109667,3,2013-3,United States,"My daughters and I visited Disneyland Paris while in France for a week. Being avid Disneyland annual passholders, we thought a visit to Disneyland Paris would be a great thing to do. If you have spent any time at Disneyland in Anaheim, this park is a bit of a disappointment. We could sum it up our thoughts in this: Disneyland Paris is a small taste of what the real thing is for those who can't get to Disneyland in California. It is pretty much the same park but on a much smaller scale. The food is undesirable, but most of the rides were pretty cool. It was neat to see the differences in Pirates of the Caribbean and Haunted Mansion (Phantom Manor in Paris). Big Thunder Mountain was worlds better in Paris, but that was about the only ride I would say that about. Space Mountain was very cool going upside down. Indiana Jones was absolutely no comparison to the one in Anaheim, even though it went upside down. Don't waste your time on the other park there, the Walt Disney Studios Park. Just get the one park ticket and enjoy the actual park. We found a Cast Member who had just been to Disneyland Anaheim last fall so he enjoyed talking to us about the differences similarities between the two parks. I was impressed how everyone spoke English and French and that they would answer a question in French then turn around and answer ours in English without skipping a beat. If you are a Disneyland freak like we are, then you will enjoy going here. I wouldn't make a special trip just to go to this park. The light show on the castle at the end of the day is worth staying for. Get a spot up close for best viewing. Don't miss the dragon in the cave under the castle. Look for it and go in. Very cool animatronic dragon.",Disneyland_Paris
157088004,5,2012-5,United Kingdom,"Disney do it as if by Magic ! Collect a map as you enter the park...check it's in English. Also get a park guide to the shows, parades and meet n' greet characters. This will tell you where & when. There's so much to see and do that a three day visit will be needed the first time. They have made a world that brings out the child in you. The rides and attractions are well thought out by their 'Imagineers' Clever and visually amazing. Some thrilling and scary...others are visually stunning designed for all ages. The pathways are clean and all flower & fauna well kept. It's a pleasure to walk around even if you don't intend to ride. The food outlets are all well staffed to minimize the wait times. Expensive ...so look for meal deals.. The shows and parades are fabulous. They offer 'fast pass' for the more popular attractions giving you a time slot to return to save a mega queue. It is a very big place and comfortable shoes are a must. Depending on what time of year you go suitable, comfortable, casual clothing is necessary. including a waterproof of some type in case of rain. Layers is probably the best way so that you can adapt to the time of day. You will be chilly by evening if you're staying for the night time illuminated parade which is fantastic. French is obviously the first language then it's repeated in English and other languages too.",Disneyland_Paris
157069115,5,2013-4,Ireland,"Firstly the cost. Is it dear? Expensive? Let's just say it costs a lot of money.... but delivers for every euro you spend. The rides are terrific. We travelled with a 7 year old and she was just as delighted to see the Disney Parade as she was to stay up late and watch the Disney Dreams light and firework show. She loved meeting Pooh bear and loved meeting the Disney Princesses. There are lots of staff (sorry Cast) and so you're never far from advice or help. They are all geared to make your stay as happy as it can be. The rides are terrific and sure there a queues for some but we knew that before we left. You don't have to go on everything and each family will decide how long they'll wait for a ride. We quickly decided that 30 minutes was our limit unless it was a ride we really wanted to go on. I'd say we could visit Disneyland again in five years and have a totally different holiday as we'd go on different rides and be more interested in different parts of the park. We spent most time in Fantasy land and only touched on Frontierland, Adventure land or Discoverland. In a few years time I'd say we'd reverse that. All in all it's a great holiday. and worth every penny!",Disneyland_Paris
157059086,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Well what can you say about the largest and most visited theme park in Europe that has not already been written.With two theme parks, and on site themed hotels its an ideal short break holiday destination for young and old alike..The Disneyland Park covers 140 acres and has 49 attractions spread among its five lands with Le Ch  teau de la Belle au Bois Dormant at its centre.With over 60 restaurants and bars finding somewhere to relax and emjoy a meal is never a problem. But I would recommend you book popular restaurants in advance or when you arrive at either your hotel or at City Hall.There are plenty of counter service fast food restaurants if you like that kind of thing, but there are also some quite elaborate table service resturants where you can enjoy a three course meal with a glass of wine or beer.If your staying at one if the on site Disney Hotels take full advantage of the Extra Magic Hours in the morning when part of the park is open two hours earlier for hotel guest.To fully explore the two parks without having to rush around I recommend a minimum of a three night four day holiday. Anything less and you will be running around like a mad man trying to get all the rides done.Finally don't forget to stay in the parks until it closes to see the breath taking Disney Dreams! spectacular.",Disneyland_Paris

Queues were as advised so no complaints there. The parade was fantastic and my two really loved seeing their favourite characters. The evening show started at 9.30 which ultimately was just too late for us all. We got tickets via Internet from an independent site and saved money, plus the 1 day ticket allowed us access to both parks for less than the price of one!,Merchandising is in full effect here so do expect your children to be  wanting  a lot of the time. Prices are very steep too but it's hard to say no to the, all the time. We had a few moments of disappointment. A number of rides were not working or under construction. No obvious notice though nor, god forbid a rebate. We tried 3 main restaurants to get a warm drink but all were closed so we had to come back to the Main Street area for an indoor sit down. We all walked half a mile to a railroad station only to be told it was shut. People were getting off, and when I challenged, we were given the reason of  because . Nice one Walt de Gaul!! This latter episode summed up the shocking standard of service. Rudeness was frequent and only once did a cast member (their words not mine) offer any sense of fun to my children who were bedecked in the mechandise that keeps the brand alive. Perhaps we were unlucky and we did have a great day. Kids are oblivious to the cr@p the parents do to make the day work so they loved it. The faults of this place were not evident next door in the Studios which was odd so it can't be a cultural thing, just an absence of flair and management.",Disneyland_Paris
157032997,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Excellent experience for the whole family. It was cold, it was long walks, it even tried snowing, but if you are a fun of Disney, rides and pure magical time that's the place to be. We came with 2 young boys, which both are above the 82cm limit which let us do everything apart of few rollercoasters (min 1.32m).Tips:   get your schedule to the FastPass attraction and do the others around it so you don't waste time.  stand along the parade route at least 20min in advance for a good spot.  must see the Disney dreams night show. Spectacular!",Disneyland_Paris
157016781,5,2012-5,United Kingdom,"Took our six years old grand daughter for the twentieth anniversary celebrations and were not disappointed. The attractions were great, especially Frontierland where we all went on the Thunder Mountain Railway and were thrilled with its twisting and turning. Then on to Pirates of the Carribean which was wonderfully realistic and somewhat scary for a six year old. We went to the Disney Fairytale Castle where we met The Sleeping Beauty for photo's. My grand daughter and all the other children there were spell bound.The icing on the cake was the Disney para 1700 and the wonderful singing and dancing.Truly a remarkable experience for all age groups which it caters for.",Disneyland_Paris

The 20th Anniversary train also travels through the park throughout the day and has all the most popular characters on it (mickey, minnie, donald,daisy,pluto etc)We had a fabulous day and got the chance to feel like a child again :)Now we are saving to go again!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris

156991313,2,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We went as a family of 7 for twins 5th birthday, most of us were very disappointed with Disney hotel and park, which turned out to be a money making rip off, inferior buffet meal in hotel at 29.99 euros   approx.   29. 90, each, was substandard, we expected better for French cuisine. Bar prices were extortionate   6 for a glass of lagerThe park was no better than any of our theme parks and everything was incredibly expensive in the park   5.90 for a tub of popcorn and queues for rides incredibly long most rides were exceptionally short and lasted less than a minute.I have visited Disney in America, and this is definitely the poor relation.

156979773,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"To say I was fairly anxious and worried about how our visit to Disneyland, Paris was going to pan out for my daughter's 10th Birthday, with our accompanying 'Autistic' 6 year old son, who does not do 'waiting' and finds crowds a struggle, was an understatement. I have to say we did find a ways of making our experience a reasonably successful one. I approached the helpful staff at 'City Hall' and they subsequently granted us with a 'Disabled Access' Pass. Which was a total godsend. We were able to enter rides at the exit gate as a whole family and we never had more than a 5  10 min wait usually. If i had not persisted and asked about this again (as the first staff member misunderstood what I was asking and I felt that her answer was not correct and so asked around) we would not have got any enjoyment from our time at the Disney Parks. My son did really struggle for a big part of his day with the crowds and size of place in general but we do feel that this pass made all the difference for him and us. At the end of the day, having a child with this particular type of difficulty is extremely tough and it was a big big decision to take him in the first place, it is a huge gamble, but really glad we took him, it would not have been fair to let him miss out on this adventure. Ofcourse, as parents, we know a bit of what makes our son tick and know how to manage him in other ways to minimise his stress and anxiety levels and I'm not saying it was the Disability Pass that was solely responsible for the success of our time at Disney, but it sure went a long way to helping. We could not have waited for 55 mins to get on a ride, this would not have been an option for us. So, anyone thinking about going with a family member with a disability such as this, please look into this at City Hall at the entrance of Disneyland Parks (not the warner studio) Just remember to take evidence of the persons Disability when you vist City Hall.With regards to our accommodation, we stayed at one of the Disney Hotels (Hotel Cheyenne). We were given an extra 2 hours in the park before normal entrance time, opens at 10am, we were allowed in at 8am (Please note, this is only for part of the park) Shuttles are regular from the Cheyenne, although, you can walk it in probably 5 10 mins. Again, we were concerned about the size of the dining room and how busy it was. End result, he just could not cope and did not want to even go in to the noisy dining area for breakfast but it was a nice hotel, lots of open space for him to run about in and so that worked well for us. He loved the hotel shop with all of the Toy Story toys, it is like everywhere else quite expensive. 3 euros for a small bottle of water or bottle   can of juice, but then everywhere is the same. The restaurant really is the only option late in evening when you have been delayed by weather and are all really tired and hungry, but again, very expensive. Around 12 Euros just for my daughter to eat a bowl of rice and or pasta as that is about all she eats, so they've kinda got you over a barrell. Not alot of other options and there is not really alot of healty snack options in the hotel shop either. It could do to be better equipped with provisions for families with young children. It was a nightmare trying to find something for my two to drink as they are so fussy and you just could not get an apple and blackcurrant juice anywhere (MacDonalds had apple in tiny teeny cartons but it was always so busy) and they wont drink water. I felt my son would have gone into a state of dehydration, so glad we brought our own tea and sugar and thankfully the shop did have milk, although in tiny teeny cartons.Apart from these few problems (but stuff that we did not find out about til we arrived) The Disney Village had some further options of places to eat,ie crepes, pizza etc. All in all, we did have a lovely experience and maybe will return one day,but maybe when we can save enough and stay in the Disney Park Hotel right at the entrance to the Park. Wow its what dreams are made of! We found the best deals were booking early enough to get deals ie hotel and park tickets and children under 7 and 12 going free etc, and going earlier in the year certainly keeps cost down.Here's to the next visit.",Disneyland_Paris

156973671,3,2013-4,United Kingdom,"Recently took our 8 and 3 year olds, and I have to say the whole experience was pretty underwhelming. Eventhough the park didn't seem that busy the queues for most rides was 30 minutes plus which can be testing with a 3 year old that likes to run around a lot!We also weren't prepared for the food prices. Whilst I expected it not to be cheap, I think    42 for 4 hotdogs 2 chips and drinks was a total rip off. I suggest if you're staying in a hotel that offers a buffet breakfast to make up baguettes and take them with you.We will come again i'm sure but not until the kids are a lot older.",Disneyland_Paris
156962741,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We recently spent 3 whole days in the Disneyland park. One of our group has an issue with her leg and is therefore in a wheelchair. The way that the Disney staff treat people in wheelchairs is absoloutly disgusting. It would be a lot better if the staff just spoke to each other because every single person seems to have different rules regarding the disabled. To clarify with anybody else who might be wondering about disability in Disneyland, you can hire a wheelchair from the main entrance of Disneyland. This requires a 150 Euro deposit (which is returned when you take back the chair at the end of your visit), and also costs 12 euros a day in rental. You then need to go over to the Disney City hall who will give you a card that registers you as disabled. This card will let you on the rides as a disabled person with one carer. Without this card, the people will not let you on the rides, whether you are in a wheelchair or not. It was the awful treatment of our wheelchair user that knocked down points on my enjoyment of this experience.That aside   the rest of our time spent here was very enjoyable. The disneyland park is split up into different areas.Fantasy land   has rides for younger children, slow themed rides, carousels, teacups, things like that. This is the most family orientated area of the park. Peter Pan's flight is a particular highlight here.Adventureland   is based on the lion king, and pirates of the carribean. Thoroughly enjoyed the pirates of the carribean water ride. Frontier land   is based on the Wild west. Indiana Jones ride is here which goes upside down. Big Thunder Mountain was well worth the ride. (doesn't go upside down). Get yourself a fast pass for these rides so you don't spend an hour queing.Discoveryland   is based heavily on space, buzz lightyear, that sort of thing. Space mountain is here (goes upside down).Every night when the park closes (usually around 9.30pm) there is a firework spectacular called 'Disney dreams'. I can't stress enough how much you need to see this show, it's absoloutly phenomenal. This takes place in front of the Disney Castle.Take as much packed lunch as you possibly can as the price of food and drink is so expensive it's ridiculous. The gift shops are also expensive, but some things are good. Most shops seem to sell the same things though to be fair. Well worth the trip, and you need a few days to see it all properly.",Disneyland_Paris
156940926,3,2012-7,Australia,Well it's the French but for Pluto to discriminate against English speaking children and push them out of the way only to have a picture taken with the French kids is taking it too far.

156931430,3,2013-4,United Kingdom,"My teenage daughter and I visited for five days last week.This visit was very very cold, although sunny and dry. Of course it's just luck what the weather decides to do. We have been before in early March and it has been hot and sunny.We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel which makes life much easier as it is next to the park and we had extra magic hours.I booked a private taxi beforehand, which didn't work out much more expensive than booking a shuttle, as on our last visit we were made to wait outside CDG terminal building for three hours in the freezing cold for our shuttle bus and my daughter was ill during our whole stay as a result.This was our fifth visit. Previously we have stayed in the New York Hotel as a family with three children (two in their teens), and were given two adjoining rooms with an excellent view. The other visits have been with our youngest daughter and we have been fortunate to stay in the Disneyland Hotel, where there are more opportunities to see the Disney characters. I will stay that it's twice the price of the New York, but of course it depends on your budget. This visit we had a room on the fourth floor with views of the gardens at the entrance to the park and the Studios in the distance, which was nice although we weren't in the room very much.Do as much research about your transfers, accommodation (check out maps of the hotel and room sizes and don't be afraid to ask for your preference), the parks and meal plans before you go.Our breakfast was included at the Disneyland Hotel and there were characters meet and greets in the morning. it is advisable to eat breakfast early, before 9am, or later, after 10.30 as there are long queues to be seated and it gets hectic. The breakfast was pretty good but it was hard to get coffee as the staff are so busy. We had Premium Meal Vouchers, which meant we could eat at any restaurant and we used them in the evening. We ate at both the restaurants in the Disneyland Hotel, California Grill and Inventions where we were able to meet the characters in a calm civilised environment. We also ate ate Cafe Mickey on two evenings which sadly on this visit was an awful experience, (See my review). It is essential to book your meals before your visit to avoid long queues and disappointment. The price of drinks and snacks in the park is extortionate. A coffee, soft drink and a coffee was about nine euro's and we were only catering for two of us!I have recently had a knee operation and my Daughter has Aspergers Autism and other difficulties, so I knew from previous visits it was essential to bring supporting documentation (a signed letter within three months of your visit), of Diagnosis etc to enable us to be given a Disabled Priority Card. I didn't ask for a card for myself, although I now have difficulty walking and use a stick, as the Disabled guest has to be with an able bodied adult and I knew that if I had it would restrict the rides we could go on. On previous visits we have been given an Easy Access Card for my Daughter and I'm still not sure what the difference is between that and an Disabled Priority Card. I would suggest if you have difficulties of any nature that can be supported with documentation, you go to City Hall when you arrive at the park and explain clearly the problems and discuss how they can support you and how the card they issue you with can help, I have heard varying reports about how many members in your group can be accommodated. On one occasion we had the Disabled Guest, two adults and two children, but I have heard of larger parties being accommodated and sometimes not, it seems to vary. Be polite and persistent. It is wise to check how many can go in the Disabled are to watch the parades, as again I have heard that that can vary too. Overall the card helped us enormously and we were able to go on many rides during the day. It is faster to get on the smaller rides, but on the bigger rides it can take between 10 and 20 minutes, which worked well for us as we waited in a quiet area with other Disabled guests. However, if you have a child or adult with severe learning disabilities, I don't think it would work as they would not understand a long wait and the concept of queueing and would have a meltdown. There doesn't seem to be any leeway on this. As I said it worked well for us, but I think as there are so many guests needing assistance there has to be a system in place. I noted that as I had read before our visit, certain disabilities were prioritised, we didn't find this to be the case. Our experience of support this time was excellent, the staff were so kind and caring towards me and my limitations and were surprised that the card was for my Daughter and not for me. One thing it is wise to remember is that this card doesn't give you a right to VIP treatment, just to support and assistance.The majority of cast members were pleasant and accommodating. There was one occasion in the Studios where one cast member was extremely rude, but generally our experience was good.We found the park to be very clean and regularly saw cast members sweeping outside and cleaning tables.The downside was the European visitors were mostly rude and do not understand the concept of queuing or respect for others, disabled guests and children. I have read previously that when waiting to see characters, small children were pushed out of the way and I saw this firsthand on this visit. As I was leaving the park on one day, a foreign woman in her thirties with a child of about seven, came hurtling into me dragging a child behind her and nearly knocked me over. I looked back surprised, didn't say anything only to receive abuse. She shouted at me that she was carrying a child, which obviously meant that it was okay to knock someone over who used a walking stick. This wasn't the only occasion we encountered this mentality unfortunately. We went in the exit for the Peter Pan ride and the Cast Members acknowledged us, and asked us to wait, as we were waiting a guy on crutches in a large group came at me and literally pushed me out of the way nearly knocking me over. My Daughter was getting used to the mentality as she jumped in front of them, a bit sad and unnecessary really. I think the Cast Members are amazed at the behaviour of some of the guests.There were less characters to meet in the park this time. We were able to use of Disabled Priority Card and met the characters at the exits within a few minutes. I felt so sorry for the families with young children who had to wait for up to an hour, surely this is something Disneyland Paris could address, having a lot more characters in the park with more frequency. The Disney Train was lovely and ran every hour with all the characters on. We stood patiently waiting for it to come past, only to have about fifty people push and jump in front of us. The mentality is staggering!The show at the end of the day was fantastic. On the down side it was packed, even in the Disabled area and the mentality of the other guests is not friendly. On one evening, we made the mistake of coming back from the village as the guests were leaving the park after the late show and it was like Moses and the parting of the waves, there were thousands and thousands of people leaving. We were amazed. The second time we watched the late show, we stood at the end of Main Street, by the Railroad Station. Even then we only stayed for a few minutes as the volume of people is overwhelming.Disney is a huge machine making money for it's shareholders and even staying in the best hotel and having a Disabled Priority Card, my Daughter and I both felt overwhelmed. It would be good to see some of the profits invested in updating the Disneyland hotels and parks, as although it is still enjoyable, nothing has changed or been updated since our first visit nine years ago. I think Disney really need to re evaluate.Although we had arranged assistance with the airline, our experience at CDG was scary. We were an hour or so early to check in. There were no available seats and even in the disabled area there were able bodied adults and children using the seats. The staff had a record of the assistance we needed, (my Daughter needs support going through security and pre boarding and now I can't walk long distances, so needed a wheelchair), but it was not forthcoming. We waited for over an hour for someone to arrive. We asked four times and were getting really worried that as they were leaving it so late, we were getting close to missing our flight. By the time the guy came and took us to the gate to board, we only had ten minutes to spare, it was that close and after having to stand near the check in desks for two hours I could barely walk and am still having extreme difficulties and am in pain after three days. The stewardesses on the flight home said this seems to be the norm at CDG but they wanted to report it again.We spent a lot less in the Disney shops this time as the merchandise hasn't changed at all. Even in the more exclusive shops there was nothing too enticing, just overpriced goods.We are avid pin traders, but again found there were no new or interesting pins and less trading posts this time. Very disappointing, as that was our main interest and we were prepared to spend some money on pins as we have done in the past.I should have know better but forgot, we arrived on Easter Monday, so the park was even busier than usual. A tip to remember is to go during the week and if you can go out of school holidays.Should we return, which I'm not sure we will, again it will need meticulous planning.",Disneyland_Paris

156903412,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,"We went for four days during October half term. Was busy, but not as bad as I'd expected. If you're a hotel guest, make use of the early opening hours. We did this a couple of times, although we stopped because there aren't enough rides open first thing to warrant doing it every day.Do use fastpass and if possible, tackle areas   rides either early or late. We used to take a rest after lunch and went back to the hotel for a couple of hours. The bus service is frequent and efficient and you shouldn't wait more than ten minutes for one.Food is ridiculously expensive and if you fancy a long lunch   rest, it might be worth hopping on the train and going out the park for something more reasonable and authentic.There's a good mixture amongst the lands for young and old kids. Staple favourites are all present i.e. Runaway Train, Phantom Manor, Space Mountain etc...Star Wars always seemed a bit out of place (although it turned out to be quite prophetic!). There's plenty of rides based on Germanic fairy tales as well as the latest Pixar favourites e.g, Buzz Lightyear. All in all lots to keep the family involved. We found four days were about right and you should forget doing it all in a day. Our only complaint was that there should have been more characters walking around as it was very difficult to get a photo   autograph. Do see the firework display at the end of the evening at least once as it's spectacular! Both at night and in the day, experiencing the castle in front of you is awesome.Enjoy and I bet you can't get  It's a small world after all...  out of your head long after you've returned!",Disneyland_Paris

That said she had a wonderful time, and particularly loved seeing all the characters of which we saw many.We did queue for nearly 2 hours to she a Disney Princess which l do not think necessary as they must have more than 2 princesses!Everything is very expensive which is a shame really as they don't need to charge 6euros for 1 hotdog,or 60euros for a character dress that costs about   25here!

156873588,5,2013-4,United Kingdom,"What an amazing holiday. Stayed in Cheyenne and was great value and lovely and quiet. Took bag into breakfast for taking rolls, cheese and salami for lunch too which saved loads of euros! (Was subtle about it but all catering staff had no raised eyebrows about 12 rolls on my tray....!) best tip for meeting characters is to check early morning in hotel foyer who will be there that morning. Much smaller queues than in park. Annette's diner good experience as was planet Hollywood. Our best value meal though was at val d'europe which cost 5 euros each way for family of 4 on rer train and only took 3 mins to get to. Had lovely pizza pasta meal for half price of restaurants in Disney (including lots of vino!)Fab family break. We then went to Paris for night and 2 days. With 5 and 7 year old was not relaxing! Very expensive, metro was horrendous! Would wait til kids are older in hindsight and should have spent additional night in Disney!",Disneyland_Paris
156872757,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,"There is definitely a knack to getting around the parks avoiding the worst of the queues   unfortunately we didn't suss it out until day 4 of our 5 day break!On day 3, we had been to the studios and done ALL the shows, except the backlot tour which had an hour's queue. It's easy to get into all the shows, as the audience capacities are massive so there is no need to arrive particularly early   eveyone gets in anyway.S0   with that all done on day 3, on day 4 we got down to the studios about 9.40 and it was all open at that time. We started on the parachutes (which has massive queues in the middle of the day) and got on straight away. With being on the first ride of the day though, I was surprised to find the ride operators had no means of drying off the seats from the rain that had fallen during the night. Luckily I was armed with a few tissues.Next   RC racer, again straight on. SO good! Straight on a second time with no queue.Then slinky dog, again no queue.By this time it was about 10.20 and already a queue had formed at Crush's Coaster. Our 5 year old isnt tall enough for this ride, so we skipped it and were straight onto magic carpets with no queue again.So   that was that section of the park done and dusted with no queuing at all!Backlot tour. It said '20 mins' queue but it was more like 40! was good though (5 year old a bit scared but there is a warning up about this)Nobody wanted to come on aerosmith coaster with me so again we skipped that.So   we joined the queue for Tower of Terror   in retrospect we should have dashed here first and got a fast pass as there was a big queue   however the scenery is so good inside that we actually enjoyed queuing!! Even our 5 year old went on this and LOVED it   it is a must do ride, SO GOOD and the height restriction is only 1.02 metres. Brilliant   would have loved to have gone on again but one queue is enough.Then   we left the park and went to have lunch at the Earl of Sandwich in Disneyland village   this is a brilliant place if you want to save money on food as it's not too dear and very nice (Mcdonalds prices but nicer food)Then   we went back to our hotel, had a swim and rest and came back to the magic kingdom park about 6 pm. Genius!!The queues were right down   we picked up a fast pass for Big Thunder Mountain and whilst we waited for our time slot, we managed Phantom Manor (didnt take 5 yr old in there as it's too scary for little ones but brilliant maybe from 7 plus   check it out to see if your little ones would like)We did star tours (no queue)The rocket ship things near space invader 2   no queue.small world, straight on.What a brilliant day!Days 1   3   we did spend a fair bit of time queueing but we covered all the rides we wanted to.Biggest queue was probably Big Thunder Mountain   I would definitely advise fast pass here. Our 5 year old loved it so much that we queued about 3 times!! (not all on the same day   she went on every day)Queuing etiquette is very different in France   the personal space seems smaller and commonly people like to press right into your back when queueing   also watch out for people brazenly pushing right by on the pretext of knowing someone further ahead in the queue   they don't! We found we really had to stand our ground in queues.The parade and firework were both fabulous. We have been to Florida too and I would make the comment that this is a very different experience. We didn't queue to meet a princess, or any other character (apart from Minnie in the hotel) and didnt see many characters at all except on the parade. In Florida, the characters have more presence   they are wandering about much more often and it's very easy to see them   also Florida does have more 'magic' about it, with every 'cast member' ready to attend to your every need   if you so much as hesitate to look at your map in Florida   someone springs right out and offers to help. Professional photographers are popping out, very friendly to take photos all the time (no obligation to buy) We didn't see any photographers in Paris, nor did the ride operators seem to offer the same kind of 'disney magic' to every little prince and princess that boarded the rides. The rides are much the same and some are even updated versions here   Space Invader 2 is one example but I found that a very 'head shaking' experience in Paris!To sum up then   our kids are 14, 10 and 5   we ALL had a ball and would highly recommend. However it IS expensive and you need to plan to get best value (we took a lot of food with us and just alternated Earl of Sandwich with McDonald's   we filled up on breakfast at the hotel)A character meal is a super idea if your budget will allow. Ours wouldnt this time   we had done this in Florida, it was the highlight of our holiday so that would be a good thing to do if possible.",Disneyland_Paris
156846800,3,2012-5,United Kingdom,"We went to Euro Disney about 5 years ago and we had sent some money on accommodation in Santa Fe hotel which was the cheapest and furthest away. The park and ride bus we took was extremely crowded that you can smell other passengers' breath.When he came out of the bus, the park was so much bigger than I thought it would be (I don't like very wide open spaces). The queues were so big we had to wait for 2 HOURS before reaching the entrance as there were lots of screaming babies and toddlers.Walking around the park felt like it seemed fake and made out of wood for film sets. The food was not that bad though I must say, we tried croque monsieur, which is a fried sandwich with cheese and ham. We also bumped into a few Disney characters which made me skip a heartbeat and I also fainted because they were twice my height.In my opinion, I would never ever go back there unless my young cousins want to.",Disneyland_Paris
156826472,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Had 4 days in the park which was enough for me and my husband but kids loved it and its a kids holiday for godsake! I agree with the other eviews staff where lovely the attention they gave the kids brilliant especially the characters. Parades and shows were brilliant.Yes two rides did break down while we were there but they quickly got them back up and running and the park very clean staff constantly collecting litter, and toliets all very clean I couldnt fault. I cant compare with florida as I couldnt think of anything worst but at the end of the day we are all different. Dislany Paris was perfect for us we had a great time, the kids had a magical experience and thats all th at matters to me!",Disneyland_Paris

156799617,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,"We took a ferry & drove all the way to Paris to take our 4 year old to Disneyland Paris. We had already been to the HongKong Disney a couple of years back. The format is the same, but some of the rides & displays were different. Eg Winnie Pooh was missing in Paris, Peter Pan had taken his place. We went in the Easter weekend, so there was bound to be plenty of crowds. But even then the queues were very long for each attraction   my pet peeve was the Princess Pavillion, where we waited for an hour & a quarter & got to see only one princess! But its amazing that the little ones waited patiently & were excited too! Oh to be this magical age when you BELIEVE! Its impossible to do the whole park in one day, so would advise that plan your trip in advance on the interactive map. An early starts helps   and do the most popular attractions early in the morning, the queues tends to be shorter. Park at the village car park   its a shorter walk & much smaller queue through security.Food is very expensive & not very healthy, I would say! But there isnt much choice if you haven't gone prepared. I would however, recommend King Ludwig's Castle in the Village, the food there was very good.The only thing I would request Management to change are the timings for the Disney Magic display (fireworks) in Spring & winter! The show itself is spectacular & definitely worth waiting for! But it started at 2130 & it was very very cold in the open. The park itself closes at 5 or 6 so there isnt much to do between then & showtime.But all in all, the little one had a great time & it was worth it to see the excitement on her face :)",Disneyland_Paris
156798005,4,2013-4,Australia,"The rides are great but get there early as some waits were up to 2 hours long. Fast pass was also worth it. We were lucky enough to stay at a Disney hotel and took full advantage of the  Magic Hours  allowing you into the park two hours prior to general public opening. Where possible, purchase either half board or full board vouchers prior to going and BOOK your restaurants as food at the park is extremely overpriced and walk ins were rarely taken. Weather was terrible however the staff where obviously used to it and accommodate the rides and attractions accordingly. Staff are pleasant and very helpful and the park was always clean. Toilets were a little of an issue as there were often lines however the wait was only 2 5 minutes. We were visiting during the Easter period and expected it to be much busier, but were lucky. Overall an amazing experience where we hope to compare with the Disney parks around the world",Disneyland_Paris
156794944,4,2013-4,United Kingdom,We went for 3 days and had an amazing time. The park is fab... Big enough to fill 2 days but not too big. We took 5 kids between 8 11. They could access most of the rides. There were a few really scary ones though! We went just after Easter weekend and it was pretty quiet. Max we waited was about 45 mins. Good system for queuing the fast pass system is free and good. and Expensive to eat but it's like that in theme parks in the UK.,Disneyland_Paris
156790702,3,2013-3,United Kingdom,"We were really excited at the prospect of taking our 2 year old daughter to Disneyland Paris. When you walk in and see the Castle, it's pretty impressive. But after two days of queuing and over priced junk food, you start to wish you had gone to Center Parcs or Alton Towers instead. We spent 2 hours, (no exaggeration), queuing to see a Disney Princess. We were so disappointed at the lack of characters wandering around the Disneyland Park. The rides were dated and very short   particularly disappointing when you've waited in line with a 2 year old for nearly an hour. The parade was nice and the castle show was fantastic. We're glad we've been and seen it for ourselves and we're sure this review won't stop others from wanting to go and experience the  magic  for themselves. However, be aware that you will queue and you may come away from it slightly disappointed and definitely a lot lighter in the wallet department!",Disneyland_Paris
156766247,1,2013-4,United Kingdom,"justt returned from disneyland paris on friday 5th april after five days in the disney hotel cheyenne,,,,first of all this was my second trip to disneyland paris with my disabled son and partner and i can tell you what a failure disneyland is to disabled people,on the first day we went to city hall to receive a disabled badge for easy access onto rides firstly the guy in city hall didnt understand us and gave us the wrong card which meant we couldnt get on many rides,i then went back the next day to get this card replaced to be told by another guy working in city hall that he couldnt give me another card as i already had one he was geting very nasty to me and actually said he didnt understand what i was saying which i found astonishing as he shouldnt be working there if he didnt understand,,,i come from belfast with a british accent not timbuktu..when i finally got this card replaced we set of to enjoy the rides but after showing this green card we where left standing whilst the ordinary queue was moving quicker than the disabled queue and this was when boats and rides passed with empty seats,also at the designated area for disabled people to watch the parade they had a rule that only one of the childs parent was allowed to enter this area with there disabled child which i found quite odd as his mum had to stand outside the disabled area which then made my son scared..also i had a argument with 3 of the staff at the train bus ride in disney village that takes you through the set of london and a mountain feature with a rush of water and fire,,,we entered the disabled area and showed are green badge for the ride and the girl at the disabled area said we would have to wait 30 mins to go on this ride and she marked us down in her folder which we didnt mind but she said we couldnt leave the area so we stood and waited then a crowd of people entered this area,this girl i was originallly talking to left and went on the tour and left somebody else in charge,we where told we where the next tour when it arrived but when it did arrive we never got on it and this was after waiting 45 mins already,i then called her and said we where meant to get on that tour and you let other people go in front of us and my child is starting to get distressed she then said sorry you are on the next one thats when i got angry and said are card number is in the folder that you have are you not reading it she then didnt no what to say and there was about 4 of them that huddled together and started talking french to each other as they obviously didnt no what they where doing which i then told them its a disgrace use dont no what is going on use need to start reading the folder and taking account for what use are doing,we then got on the ride after waiting 1 hour which was originally meant to be 30 mins as for the price of food in the park and hotels its a total disgrace mainly all burgers and chips and no decent food to be got anywhere,,for instance we got 3 burgers 3 chips and 3 cokes and it was 35 euro at todays going rate that is about 35 pounds sterling these are the prices all over disneyland and i dont think you would get any cheaper as some other areas are dearer and to be honest these are not great burgers and chips kfc is a lot better and thats honestly,,as for items for sale in the shops take your disneyshop in your high street in the uk and every item is double the price in the parks and hotels in disneyland.we also seen 2 rats in the park one was massive and the other was on its way there also..all in all french ignorant,expensive,wont be back,,staff training poor..rides breaking down whilst on them which was peter pan ride. french IGNORANT staff training is a must for disney staff...airport staff at charles de gaulle airport where also a total disgrace to my disabled son they didnt think he was disabled and he was in a wheelchair they made me lift him out for security and i already had details put on my holiday arrangements that he was which when i was explaining this at security and after showing them a disabled badge they didnt no what i meant,,passengers behind us at security actually came over to us at departure lounge and couldnt believe what happened and they even said that it was a disgrace at what they made us do,,,i believe that if you want to visit disneyland save your money for florida as eurodisney is not worth the money...ALSO keep your valuables with you at all times,we left my childs wheelchair pram outside the peter pan ride with my sons mickey mouse blanket draped over the back of the handles securely,when we got of the ride the blanket had been stolen which we couldnt believe what sick minded people are out there that they would steal a blanket of a disabled pram not to mention who would give there child another childs blanket is beyond belief,obviously who ever done this had watched us leaving the pram outside peter pan ride and entering the ride to then steal the blanket,to be honest we where glad as we could have easily left valuables attached to the pram,i asked the disney staff did they see anyone at the pram and yet again she didnt no what i was saying...TYPICAL..i hope this helps a lot of people make up there mind before they visit or think about visiting. thanks",Disneyland_Paris

The staff were polite, we found the park clean and constantly saw staff sweeping the roads. The queues were generally 45 minutes, but once inside the ride, there was always plenty to see. Food is expensive, so would recommend taking snacks drinks in with you. Parade is great, but take your place early. Same with the evening light firework show   get there early!",Disneyland_Paris
156682981,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Visited the park on a saturday which was very very busy, finally entered the park around midday and it was amazing. It was thrilling been there the atmosphere the characters walking around the park talking to all the children. The queues were really long and most rides we ended up queing for about 45 mins to an hour. which with 2 young children is a long wait for a ride that lasts 2 minutes. One thing we did find that in going to the park mid morning by 3 pm most people are beginning to leave which then reduces the queing times for the rides and we were actually able to do the majority of rides within a couple of hours once the park became a little quieter.On the day we visited they had a spectacular show at closing which consisted of the castle been lit up with various characters, fireworks, it was an amazing show and lit up the sky.We ate in the park just after lunchtime thinking that it would be quiet however it took 1 hour and 10 minutes queuing for burgers and fries, it did appear to at times to be language barrier and a general lack of understanding of the orders.On the whole we had a fantastice timeand will visit again in the future.",Disneyland_Paris
156681221,3,2013-4,United Kingdom,Apart from the disney castle I couldn't distinguish this from any other theme park. During the 2 whole days we were there we saw no characters walking around. Not a single one. OK some of the rides were disney themed but apart from that it was just a theme park and once you take the disney out of it I'd rather go to Alton Towers. The best thing about the park was the firework display at the end of the night.,Disneyland_Paris
156598454,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"If you have never been to Disney and Disney Paris is your first trip then it's fun but to be honest I would save your money and go to Florida as I have now been to all three. I do not want to down disney but it is a business and there are different levels of service, the two American parks are a 10 compared to Euro Disney which I would score an 8.Expect to pay high prices for food and expect people working there only to speak very little English. The main difference in the parks was the amount of people available to help you, also when you are in line waiting for your ride in the US there will be working monitors or people to entertain you to keep you occupied there was very little in Euro Disney. But the magic is still there and enjoy. If you can afford the extra cost for the fast track passes pay it as this will take away most of the frustrations also when you see the time that it will take to get to the ride from entering the ride add a few minutes more as fast track take priority.Please enjoy the adventure every child should.",Disneyland_Paris
156588375,5,2013-3,Ireland,"The layout of the park is great. Having pored over the map before travelling we though we'd be walking for miles, however it's all very neatly laid out.There's a lot to do and see in the park, even though it's not all sprawled out. The rides aren't really for thrill seekers but if you're young at heart, it's still nice to see the beautiful Sleeping Beauty's Castle, the carousel, meet Mickey Mouse and go on a number of the train and boat rides where you can see the scenes from the classic Disney cartoons. The paint jobs are well maintained on the buildings and the gardens perfectly groomed. Every little prop tells a story and the little kids loved that.The Studios park is not too far away if you want to go between parks and catch different shows. The Disney Dreams closing light show is on until October 2013 and we're delighted we caught it on time. It's magnificent and a real for treat adults and children alike. Plenty of Disney and non Disney accommodation nearby and transportation is adequate.Even in March, though it was very cold this year, there were plenty of rides with 45 mins waiting times. Try not to walk the park  in order  from the morning, break it up a little and hopefully you'll miss the rush and peak times.Make sure you take advantage of the Fastpass and get one early on. On a busy afternoon you could be looking at waiting until evening for your allotted time. Many rides become quiet half hour before closing with waiting times of 5mins. Recommended  thrill  rides: rock 'n' Rollercoaster, RC Racer and Tower of Terror.Cons: We couldn't figure out where the bag storage has been moved to as the lockers are now disabled. The food is mostly junk food and a lot of it is very expensive. The bathrooms, while pretty on the outside are very very smelly and quite old looking on the inside.",Disneyland_Paris

Thinking of that, I would never ever go there in summer time. There were queues absolutely everywhere, either for toilet, food or attractions. The staff at the attractions could  ve been a lot better to put people in the different wagons and so on, there were a lot of half ful boats wagons because people wanted to sit at the front row (!!). We  d expected that there would be characters walking around in the park, but we didn  t see any of them, except at the parade. Also, the attractions were quite poor, especially when waiting time is 30 60 minutes..We  ll never go back, and we won  t recommend to go there if you (and your kids) aren  t up for queues. Although   our 5 year old was very happy, and very patient... The parade was great, and the Disney Dreams at night was absolutely stunning.

156555293,1,2013-3,Japan,"Our daughter is 9 years old, and since we were spending a week in Paris, why not visit another of the magic kingdoms? Well, among all of the Disney parks we've visited (Hong Kong, Los Angeles, and Tokyo), Paris Disneyland is, BY FAR, the absolute worst one.Firstly, staff training is poor. The staff are the ones who must be enabled to create the  magic . The service level is nowhere near that found at Tokyo Disneyland, where the crew members work so hard to ensure you have a great experience. The staff at PD were rude to us or others on several occasions. At the Haunted Mansion, some kids were talking and the attendant walked right up to them, put her face about 6 inches away from their faces and said,  It's RUDE to speak while I'm speaking.  What the hell? They're kids. Some rides are so understaffed that basic safety checks (like seat belt securely fastened, shoulder bar locked in place etc.) are not performed.Big Thunder Mountain broke down while we were there. Unbelievable and a sign that basic maintenance is poor.Secondly, there are designated smoking areas, but nobody enforces them. Adults (and some teenagers) were smoking throughout the park and extinguishing the butts anywhere they could. Even while waiting in line to buy tickets, or queue at entrances. What kind of family environment is that?The queues weren't all that bad the day we went, but the park standards are really poor. They need to take a lesson from Tokyo Disneyland on overall strategy and execution. We won't be back!",Disneyland_Paris

Well, most attractions had longer than 1 hour waiting times and we were not able to enjoy everyone of them, since we spent time at the Walt Disney studio park. Considering the normal price, they should find a way to have shorter waiting times (the fastpass is not always convenient, if you don't know how long you have to wait at the other attractions).

On our first day in the park we got just one autograph and photo yep just one! You see the characters are only there for about 5 mins before they are shewing children away like animals! This happened to my wife and children on 5 occasions! We was very disappointed as without the characters Disneyland is just another theme park!

156468117,4,2012-12,South Africa,"Having never visited a Disney park before, this was a first time experience for us which we will never forget. The Disneyland park for us was not as good as the Walt Disney Studios Park (please see my other review), but we believe this was because our children are older. Disneyland park, with its characters and parades, is ideal for the younger Disney fans. What we did enjoy were the roller coaster rides, and we can certainly recommend those, particularly the one in Frontierland, as well as the space mission. The fact that they are all pretty much inside is also great, as the weather was really awful. we enjoyed the parades, and the highlight was the light show at the end of the day, which was truly amazing.

156461009,3,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Before travelling I trawled through this forum to get as many tips as possible, so now that I am back I'll give some sort of report along with the tips I took, and my own. We were brought here by my inlaws as a trip to celebrate their 50th Wedding anniversary. Because they booked it all we didn't have any control over anything so it was a bit of a stressful trip. We have two small children, 22 months and 3, it was freezing cold (obviously out of the control of Disney!) and as such the kids didn't enjoy it at all (not surprised!).We stayed at the newport bay club and walked in on both days. The first day we went straight to the peter pan ride and both kids screamed in the queue the entire time (25 min wait). We had to leave the park to warm the boys up and sat in mcdonalds for an hour, as there didn't seem to be anything open where we could sit inside and have a coffee cake etc. After that we came in to the park again but the boys were asleep in the pushchair so just wondered around. Went to the Studios and wondered for a bit, both kids still asleep. They woke up in time for the stunt show spectacular   featuring Lightening Mcqueen (only on for about 5 mins of the 45mins total) It was outside and freezing so the kids got too cold again, except we were stuck there until it finished. My husband loved this as it was car chases etc. Eldest boy mildly amused. Went back to hotel as the kids just weren't enjoying it, and got ready for our meal at L'Auberge. This was also a bit stressful and they didn't eat anything and were scared of the characters. After they warmed up a bit they posed for one photo. That day was a write off and I was very glad I wasn't paying for it myself, thinking it was a monumental waste of money!Day two was much much better. Sun was out and therefore warmed us up by 1 degree, seemed to make all the difference!Went back to peter pan and waited for 25 mins again (during EMH) as my eldest wanted to go on it again. Then tea cups, then casey juniors train ride, then story book land. Then Lunch at Cafe Mickey (recommended!), then they both fell asleep again. End of fun!Went to toy story land 3 times as they are both buzz mad, but on all occasions they were either asleep or too cold to want to get out of the pushchair. Tried to get to the parade but didn't get there in time and didn't see anything. Kids still not interested in getting out of the pushchair.In all, I'd say they were just too young to appreciate and enjoy it. Disneyland itself is amazing, magical and I love it. It's expensive, yes, but what do you expect? My point is, wait until you can have a better chance of enjoying it, instead of constantly getting  I don't want to  or  I want to go home  from your small kid. We didn't really have any issues with queues as we didn't go on any big rides, didn't come across any smokers and didn't get pushed. But then I don't think we were in the park as much as you would be normally.My tips:*Take an extra blanket, you may not need it but if you do it's soooooo worth it. The kids had a much better day on the second day when I brought the blankets out with us. * Take snacks to keep them going. And maybe a flask with hot drinks, as difficult to get somewhere to sit and shelter. They check your bag on the way in but nobody batted an eyelid at the amount of food and drink in my change bag. Plus they didn't check the pushchair if you need to stash more substantial food there!*Take a kettle for the room if you need to make milk for the babies. Or tea for yourself to warm up!*Book character lunch at Cafe Mickey, expensive but so worth it! We also had dinner at L'Auberge and met the princesses. This meant we didn't feel the need to queue at any other time to meet and take photos with the characters. the queues for these were horrendous in the day!*Do the buzz lightyear laser blast if you have a small boy and toy story fan. Morning is best, queue was 25 mins at around 11am. *Comfortable shoes*Thermal underwear for kids! Tie the gloves to strings to their jackets so they don't get lost. Hats and scarves a must. All in one for the littlies even better!*Get a map so you can pinpoint toilets, various stops both for children and inlaws! One in the arcade just parallel to main street is ace because it is indoors and you can warm up while waiting for the toilet goers. Warning, only one set of toilets in the village and you will not be allowed to go in any of the shops restaurants cinema unless you are already a customer of that establishment (fair enough otherwise they would have a lot of maintenance)*Use the EMH to get to the kiddie rides. Fast passes if you can, but the peter pan one wasn't working. *It's a small world annoying as usual, but the kids enjoyed it. Or eldest should I say, the youngest was asleep!*Don't go on the eurostar, too long a trip and too much hassle with luggage and pushchair, although bonus is station right by village. Also, the only train out of there is at 6pm and after checking out at 11am you are stranded for 6 7 hours if you don't have a park ticket for that day.*If you are going eurostar, try and do the Disney express that take your luggage to the hotel, and back to the station, especially if you are stranded for hours on end.*If you are going to see the parade you have to be there at least 4.30 for the 5pm start, otherwise you will see nothing. Even if you stand back because everyone has people on their shoulders. *See the disney dreams show, it is spectacular. BUT COLD! Wrap up for that. Hot drink flask a must for this occasion. Small kids may be scared, eldest ok, but 22 month old just whimpered and cried the whole time (and he is a bruiser normally).I can't remember anything else, but will write in the comments section if I remember!",Disneyland_Paris

Rude French people in queues pushing leaning on you and basically being annoying as possible this was the worst visit for both of the above. High light of the trip was the Disney dreams show it was brillant! Weather was cold but didn't stop use from enjoying ourselves.

Yes they know how to get the              off you but hey its a brilliant family holiday and one in which I take many great memories from. Be prepared to walk plenty so wear the trainers. Keep a bottle of water in the bag and make sure you plan to hit the parade at least 1 2 hour before it starts to get a good view. Be patient and plan ahead   they provide a good app and its well worth downloading. For adults it makes you feel like a kid again and I loved it!,Disneyland_Paris
156395907,4,2013-4,Australia,"This is just the most incredible place i have ever seen. The whole layout is just fantastic. The biggest highlight is the parade. Do everything you can to make it and find a place about 445 for the 5 pm start. The price hurts. We bought 2 day   2 park tickets. For two adults, one 5 year old and a 2 year old ( which is free   under 3 ) the price was    404    139 for the adults   126 for childrenIf you go in the morning, and stay all day   it is worth it But little ones   it is no fun for them   tiredness kicks in and there is not a 2 or 3 year old on the planet that can stand in line for an hour or more. And YES you have to do that.We read here on tripadvisor some tips which was greatTake your own food and waterThe rides are quieter in the afternoons (ish)Buzz lightyear and it's a small world rides are the best for families.Overall   thouroughly impressed. What an incredible event.I gave it 4 5 just because of the queues and the price. Take those into acount and accept them, and you will see it to be everything a fairytale should be.",Disneyland_Paris
156394040,2,2013-3,United Kingdom,"They should pull it all down after 20 years and start again! Preferably in another country.Apart from rides not working due to 'technical difficulties', Staff with attitudes that would make Walt turn in his grave, the whole place could do with a lick of paint! 3 times we queued for rides ( at least 30 mins.) and 3 times when we approached the front we were told it was closed due to technical problems. Three separate days of queueing for the Backlot Tour at 5.15 each evening ( the park closed at 6) it would be shut down due to problems. and never re opened. The problem,IMHO,was that the staff wanted to go home early! The queues on most of the rides would be halved if they bothered to fix the broken cars. You'd think they would do this overnight, but no, the same cars would be out of action the next morning. Even a lot of the staff that were 'part of the ride' didn't get into the Disney atmosphere of things as they do in Orlando. In my opinion the French need a good kick up the rear and get their act together. After all, they are representing the great legend of Walt Disney!In contrast, the Grandchildren absolutely loved it, especially getting the Characters' autographs!!",Disneyland_Paris
156384451,3,2013-1,United Kingdom,"The main thing in its favour is that it's in Europe so it's easy to get to. But it's very expensive and not a patch on the parks in either Florida or California. And they're cheaper to stay at over more than 4 days! The direct Eurostar service is a dream but I'm afraid there's no getting away from the fact that when it comes to service...well, let's just say it's done but grudgingly if at all. Sure, the rides are as good as ever but the food   disappointingly for France   is the same amusement park average ness you'll find anywhere. And the weather is depressingly uncertain. We'll be back, but next time as day trippers and we'll bring our own food!",Disneyland_Paris
156383808,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Just returned from a 3 night stay at Disneyland Paris, all I can say is .WOW.... It was truly magical! Both children (9 and 7) enjoyed it very much, the que wasn't that bad for a bank holiday weekend, maximum we waited for a ride was for 30 minutes. The castle is out of this world and the park looked amazing at night. The distance between each part of the park wasn't much so there was less walking (compared to Alton towers). The parade was great but the disney dreams show at night left us all with our mouth open, it really is amazing and not to be missed. Staff around the park were pleasant enough and all instructions were given in several languages, which was helpful. There are lockers in the park at the entrance, toilets were clean, however, limited choice of food outlets and on the expensive side.

Daughter was in awe of everything and able to go on the majority of rides (although disappointed that she couldn't go on the biggest roller coasters!) Would we go back? Of course! We also ate in Inventions, Cafe Mickey, Buffalo Bills and Auberge de Cendrillon in order to meet as many characters as possible, cannot recommend these places enough if you want to meet all the Disney stars!",Disneyland_Paris

We read the reviews before we visited and would recommend to take snacks for the kids and yourselves in to the park each day.If your kids want souvenirs then be prepared to pay for them. A dress fit for a princess started at 60 euros.Would definatley recommend the character meal at the Disneyland Hotel. Was expensive but the location, characters and food was outstanding.The only downside was that our accommodation   Davey Crockett lodge had no sharp knifes   recommend taking your own.For those of you who have young children who want to see the princesses then be prepaired to queue. 2 hours is a very long wait of peak let alone during peak season.All in all a fantastic family holida",Disneyland_Paris
156171461,5,2013-3,Canada,I am a huge Disney fan so I was really excited for this. We were able to buy tickets through the concierge at our hotel. It was really easy to get to on the RER train. It was a really fun time. There are 2 parks and you can see them both in one day easily. There are alot of food options which is nice. There were long lines at some attractions so the fast passes (we did not have them) would probably have been worth it.,Disneyland_Paris

Stood for ages for them to sign book and their chaperones were letting the french first. So many parents were complaing. Then all of a sudden they were gone. Should have the characters walking around all day like they do in Florida not just for certain times in the days. 2 hour queue to see princess, 45   120 for other rides.

156125906,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"This was our second trip to Disneyland, both experiences were fabulous. My husband and I took our 2 grandchildren, aged 7 and 4. We went for 5 days. Weather overall was cold but that didn't stop us having fun. The parks are great but be prepared to queue, sometimes we just gave up and returned another time. We did find some of the europeans very rude and just push their way onto things, especially when the children were trying to have their pictures taken with the stars or with scenery behind them, it gets overly annoying at times, I overheard a lot of British people complaining about this. My grandaughters favourite show was Small World, and I have to say was mine to, the dolls are fabulous, it covers most of the countries of the World. She dragged us onto it 4 times and each time we spotted something that we hadn't seen previously. There is so much to see and do there, we needed the 5 days to go on everything we wanted to.The food in the parks is plentiful but not cheap, The parades are great but try and get a place an hour before as there are so many people there you wont get a good view otherwise, especially if you have small children with youWe came home exhausted but was well worth the trip, the grandchildren loved it.

156061089,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Hi,I am not really one for writing lots of reviews about places, but I lurve reading reviews and I found many of the reviews on trip advisor really useful when we planned our trip.We booked with TUI just before xmas 2012. My husband and I had decided we were going to take the plunge and take our little boy of 2 years 5 months to see Mickey and friends. We told my cousin and her hubby and she asked if they could join us! The more the merrier.My hubby is a real planner which is just what you need for Disneyland. If i were to advise anyone on anything it to plan especially if you have young children.We also had a watch word; you snooze, you lose!!!!!!!!!!We stayed at the Newport Bay hotel on floor 7, the Admirals floor. Our trip to paris was excellent flying from Birmingham international.I would say that the French seem inempt at keeping baggage together. My Cousin and her hubby lost two bags! Yes, 2 bags and the airport staff whilst helpful, seemed unconcerned as we got the impression it was a common occurance!!!!!We booked out transfer with TUI and were taken by coach to our hotel. Check in was great as the Admirals floor has its own check in. This is one of the reasons why we chose it as queuing was going to be a common feature of the trip and the more we could avoid the better!The room was large and spacious. George, our son, is only 2 and went free and consequently we didn't get a cot although you can book them. My cousin was luckier and had an adjoining room with 2 large beds so her children could sleep together. George slept in our bed and all was well. The room was clean. I am a real stickler for cleanliness and it was acceptable. The grouting in the room needed scrubbing with bleach and a toothbrush and the bathroom light needed a major dust, but other than that it was just fine.The snooze and lose watch word was to do with breakfast. We booked 7am breakfeast. Forget the word holiday when coming to Disneyland. Be prepared to rise early, be out on your feet for 14 hours and crash into your bed. 7am was a great time to get brekkie as it was not busy. by 7.30am and 8am people were queueing for tables...as i said, i hate queues with toddlers, so we avoided this. Continetal brekkie was served with a good choice of stuff. We filled our juice bottles from the machines and the waiters didn't seem to mind. I ddin't do the whole sandwich making thing as we ate in the park.We had a half board plus option with our booking. This meant we got brekkie and a meal. This is where prior booking is essential! We saw the Buffalo Bills Wild West Show (79 euros per adult for front seats) on the first night which is excellent. Great food, great atmosphere and entertaining for all ages. You chow down on a campfire feast of chilli,corn bread, chicken, ribs and apple pie with unlimited drinks at the table. We paid for front seats and the toddlers were free. This meant we had them our lap and technically they didn't get food, but the waiters just gave us extra food for them without any question.It is essential to book all entertainment like this in advance. Phone the park and book ALL restraunts you intend to use. My huuby trawled trip advisor for the best eating houses which we could use on half board plus and booked up in January!Day two saw us hit the park. Again we planned which area we would hit so we could do as much as possbile. We left the hotel at 8am and walked to the park. There is a train but we opted to walk to limber up for the day ahead. Baggage check into the park is cursory for weapons i guess. They don't care you have drinks and snacks and I packed masses of them in the case and took stuff daily. Cereal bars, Fruit pouches, tetra pak juice, choccy, etc are essentials or you'll be spending lots more than necessary. We ate at the Blue Lagoon restraunt. Lovely and exotic food. They had a kids menu for the 6 year old (who is fussy and hates chips!) and had a choices she liked. The men ate Barracuda and my cousin and I had chicken. Starter, Dessert and a drink were included at half board plus. The choice was from a 34 euro per head menu, so not bargain basement rubbish. Luckily the toddlers slept for most of the meal but when awake the waiters gave us FREE food for them which was a bonus!That evening we ate at McDonlads as we had a late lunch. Not snazzy, but not pricey either.We saw the evening spectacular and my little boy was awe struck. I have to say it is totally worth staying around for.Wednesday saw us hit the Studios part opf the park. We'd booked a meal at the all you can eat called Restraunt Des Stars in the Studios area. Fabulous food. Amazing choice and again the toddlers ate free. This was part of our half board plus package.The evening was our night to go to Cafe Mickey. OMG! how excited were our kids!!!!!! Again, book or you'll be eating at 9pm. We saw all of the main characters and they spent time at our tables, signed the autograph books and the kids thought it was magic. This is a great option rather than buying breakfast at Cafe Mickey for 20 euros per child plus and adult fee too! The food was lovely, the service was slow and hit n miss but you go for the experience and the magic, not the service!Thursday we hit another area of the park and went to walts for late lunch. Again we'd boked because believe me you won't get a booking walking in off the street and my cousin and I were convinced they vetted those walking in on spec!!!!!!!!!!! An amazing setting, a great menu with a good childs choice. Not really the type of place to take toddlers I would say but we have the opinion our money is a good as anyones.....! This place is a little up market. The staff less used to dealing with kids. We had to pay for a meal here for the toddlers. They shared a 10 euro bowl of pasta. We saw both the Parade and the evening spectacular. They are a must.Friday, our last day. We checked our luggage into storage and hit the park again. This was do rides the kids had not done within reason. We went to Planet Hollywood for a goodbye lunch. You cannot book here.......... 133 Euros for 4 adults and 3 kids. Pricey, but worth it!We had a magical holiday. Yes, we spent quite a bit ...around 2500 pounds. My little boy spent 100 euros (given by grandparents etc.) in the shops but he got lots of stuff and hey, he went to have a good time and thats what he's had!!!!!!!DO's and DON'TsDO....PLAN PLAN PLANBOOK ALL RESTRAUNTS IN ADVANCETAKE SNACKS AND DRINKS IN YOUR CASETAKE TEA, COFFEE HOT CHOCCY FOR YOUR ROOM AS ITS GRATIS JUST ONCE!LABEL LUGGAGE REALLY WELL AND SPREAD STUFF ABOUT IN CASES SO IF ONE IS LOST YOU'LL STILL HAVE CLOTHES UNTIL THEY TURN UPGO WITH VIEW YOU'LL BE OUT 12 HOURS PER DAY plusTAKE GOOD WALKING SHOESTAKE A HAT, GLOVES, SCARF AND LAYERS OF COATS AS ITS VERY COLDTAKE A PUCHCHAIR EVEN IF YOU CHILD IS WALKING ..........ITS A GOOD TROLLEYTAKE A BLANKET OR TWO FOR EVENING SHOWSTAKE LONG JOHN'S AND THERMALSGO WITH A VIEW IT'S DISNEY....IT'S GOING BE MAGICALGO WITH A VIEW, IT'S DISNEY, THINGS WON'T BE CHEAPBE AN EARLY BIRD FOR BREKKIE   YOU SNOOZE, YOU LOSESTOCK UP ON DISNEY CLOTHING FROM ASDA ETC TO SAVE YOU SOME CASH OUT THERESTOCK UP ON FLASHES, GLOW STICKS ETC FOR THE EVENING SHOW FROM POUNLAND AND THE LIKE (THEY SELL DISNEY STUFF VERY CHEAPLY)GO TO THE PARADEGO TO THE NIGHT SHOWHAVE COFFEE STOPS TO KEEP YOUR LEVELS UPTAKE A CAMERAUSE FASTPASS TO QUEUE BUSTUSE THE IPHONE APP TO TELL YOU WHERE QUEUES ARE SMALLESTDON'TGO IF YOU HATE WALKINGGO WITH THE IMPRESSION IT'S GOING TO BE CHEAP OR YOU'LL SPEND ALL YOUR TIME BEING MISERABLEI honestly was really sceptical about this trip.

I took a pushchair lock as i'd rad to do so, but honestly, i didn't use it. People are in the same boat as you there with kids and nothing went missing from the trolley or the snack bag i left when we were on rides.It is scrupuliously clean as there are always people out litter picking and sweeping. The toilets were clean and fresh (i did go at peak time though). The staff are helpful and very friendly. They want you to have a fab time!",Disneyland_Paris
155959929,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Was very busy but we expected that, It was slightly disappointed as it was freezing which I know cannot be helped but what they need to do is invest in some outdoor heating for the queues to the rides (1 hour queues in near freezing weather is tedious and put a real downer on the day), However the rides were all super fun and enjoyed them thoroughly. Most the staff spoke decent English and were very friendly. If you want to save money and time take a packed lunch as the cafes were expensive and had huge ques. The foods in the cafes were of a standard quality and different cafes  restaurants meant a huge selection of food.If you want to make the most of your visit plan your day beforehand, think of things like getting to the furthest rides first as they will have shorter queues, having lunch early or later so as to get shorter queues while people are eating their lunch and other tactics like eating drinking in queues.Overall, we enjoyed our visit. Anyone looking to visit this year make sure you take advantage of the amazing light display  fireworks show at the end of the day; this was the highlight of our day! If you miss this you will kick yourself.",Disneyland_Paris
155959730,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Although things are starting to, literally, look a little faded now, there's still great fun to be had here.Travelling off peak seems to be the best way to beat the queues. Rarely had to wait for more than 20 minutes to get onto a ride and the Fast Pass system is well worth using to cut queuing down even further. It's worth taking your own food and drink as the on site options are very expensive indeed. The 'magic hours' given as part of the Disney hotel deal are a bit 'hit and miss'. Only the rides for the very young children are in operation before 1000, but it does give you an opportunity to join the queue for the Princess Pavillion early if you have a little girl in tow. This is well worth doing as the wait time for this attraction is horrific. Although not really Disney's fault, what lets the Disneyland Park down are some of their guests. It's not uncommon to see adults pushing children away from characters so they can get autographs for themselves. Yes, that's grown men and women shoving children so that *they* can get autographs from someone dressed as a cartoon character. It's truly pathetic and not just a little sad. It's very hard indeed to remain calm when it's one of your kids getting shoved, but the last thing you want to do is ruin an otherwise great holiday by getting angry. There are not many characters walking around the park in general. But when you see the above first hand, it's not hard to see why. The character minders should introduce a 'zero tolerance' policy. Anyone who grabs at a character, shoves a child or gets abusive (in any language) should be ejected from the park and banned for life. Or, at the very least, make it known that characters will not sign autographs for adults.Such a shame that the above needs to be said. But forewarned is forearmed! And we certainly didn't let a small minority of idiots spoil the fun.The Star Tours ride is a must see for fans of the Star Wars series! And Big Thunder Mountain is great for younger thrill seekers too. But do check height restrictions when you're planning.",Disneyland_Paris
155948723,3,2013-3,United Kingdom,"This was our 10th visit to disneyland paris , everytime we've been here we've always enjoyed it.This time , the attitude of the people has changed , we found the people whether serving in shops , or at dinner or the public in general all very rude. I don't know whether it's the Austerity cuts getting people down , but their attitude this time stank . And they don't like to give you change for a note , I asked one shop assistant for my change and he actually shoved it in my hand , how rude is that . As always the rides are great , as are the parades and characters. But I seriously would like disney to employ better manord staff , this ruined the whole disney experience for me this time , and I for one won't be going back again.We stayed in what I regard as the best hotel Sequoia Lodge , which has been refurbished and as always top notch , atmosphere excellent , food excellent as was the pool for the kids. Well worth it .",Disneyland_Paris
155946094,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"As a birthday celebration we decided to book a 3 night stay and visit Disney, what a great idea, our girls are 2 and a half and 1 and were absolutely thrilled with every aspect, plenty of opportunities to meet characters and enjoy rides and watch parades and the evening show in the park was spectacular. The downsides were the practicalities of two small children, the shuttle bus from the hotel to the park was horrific, in spite of running every ten minutes queues were ignored, it was a free for all with no consideration given to parents with small children, after watching the late show we allowed one bus to leave, choosing to wait for the second one, and once having fought our way on with a pushchair etc, the evening degenerated into a slanging match between various adults attempting to get off the bus at their hotel whilst people were still trying to get on! In the parks themselves the meet and greet with characters could be better organised, currently it is based upon how confident your child is at pushing to the front. Food prices are high but you are a captive audience so its difficult to avoid paying, also it is difficult to avoid the disney shops themselves where the toys and gifts are fabulous albeit expensive so be prepared to spend spend spend! In spite of the negatives I would still recommend to anyone for the sheer joy that children old and young experience.",Disneyland_Paris
155923403,1,2013-3,United Kingdom,"To start off with i would like to say i am really not one to complain but disneyland paris i feel people must know what it really is like! To start off with we got to our hotel the new york it was lovely, very pleasent staff and even had the company of goofy character whilst we were checking in which to start the holiday was fantastic!! We checked in and got to the room, we were both very impressed, very spacious and clean. As you can imagine we were both very excited to see the parks, its something i have wanted to experience my whole life (age 22), we entered the park and were very impressed by all the buildings and the castle, we got out our map and began to wonder round. we came across the first land 'discovery land' we went to the buzz lightyear lazer blast, went to queue and the guy tells us the ride is now closed due to techincal problems...ok, on to the next ride, space mountain, looks great, 80 minute queue, so we got a fast pass for over an hour later...when we came to use the pass we still waited for over 30 mins! hardly a 'fastpass'!! we then looked round and after realising there wasnt much else to look at in discovery land we went to get to the next land, followed what the map said and constantly lead us to dead ends, no sign posts as you can imagine this is highly frustrating when you dont know the place and want to explore!! We then looked around all the other the other lands and couldnt believe how little disneyland really had to offer on top of that the rides that did take our fancy were anything from 50 mins to 90 min queues! We decided to stay and wait for the disney dreams show in the evening, we waited from 6.30 to get a great spot at the front, an hour and a half later (and when we had both froze) the show started and the amount of people the are so so rude and think it is ok to push you out the way is unreal, after an hour and a half wait in the FREEZING cold letting people push in front of me is not amusing in the slightest,after spending the whole show trying our best to keep our spot at the front it ended, and may i add the show was AMAZING! but for the price you pay along with how long you wait, it just doesnt justify all the other problems we faced throughout the week. we stayed 5 more long days, we queued and queued, only to have RUDE ignorant people PUSH in front of us even when we have waited over 45 mins to get on a ride, we could not get over the lack of unorganisation at the place, there was about 4 desks that you check through to get into the parks, so you have to queue AGAIN for ages just to get in the park, oh yes and of course before that you have to queue for a further 20 or so mins just ti get through bag check even thought we didnt have a bag!!!! to exit the park, guess what another ridiculous LONG queue. we went to watch the beautiful parades, waited and waited, right at the front to have again rude an ignorant people try to push us out the way!! The prices to eat and drink in the park are very expensive its expected i guess, but for a family it would soon add up!! The rides that you think are going to blow your head of they are that good, are really really not! the indianna jones ride we queued for over 50 mins got on and when it went round and stopped we both looked at each other and laughed, we really couldnt believe that it was over, so so terrible! Like i said im not one to complain but if you want your moneys worth choose something different save and go florida and get your real moneys worth. oh yes and one more thing, if you did decide you wanted a fast pass for a day, it is 60 euro EACH and lasts for just the ONE day and only includes about TEN rides. hmm, ill let you decide, but please have a good think before coming here!",Disneyland_Paris

Its like a free for all when you get to the park2) Food is very expensive. Put aside at least 45 Euros for a family of 4, for each meal. What is worse, is that the range of food is limited (mainly junk food), and the service is slow and sluggish.3) The service is so slow and laissez faire.

Wherever possible use  fastpass  its free, not all rides do it but if the line is too long you swipe your park ticket at a machine beside the ride entrance and you will be given a pass that allows you to enter a much shorter queue at an allocated time the only catch is you can only get a fastpass for another ride when time is passed on the original pass. A handy tip if you have young and older kids use the little kids park pass to get extra fastpasses for the older kids rides so they can go on twice without queueing for hours!!. If you are staying in a Disney hotel take advantage of the  extra magic hours  this allows hotel guests entrance into the park at 8am two hours before the park opens to the public allowing for great photo ops with the castle minus the crowds, and there are almost no queues for rides such as  dumbo, teacups, carrosel, in fantasyland and buzz lightyear and orbitron in discoveryland whereas once the park opens their lines can take up to 90 minutes!! Food is really expensive we brought loads of snacks likes biscuits and crisps from home because an occasional treat like hot chocolate or tea and a doughnut for 4 people cost 27euro!! For what you pay the food isnt great there is a McDonalds in Disney Village so if you have fussy eaters just stick with that as i learned the hard way although the Rainforest Cafe in Disney Village is also expensive we went here as a treat on our last day and the kids loved it, its an experience they wont forget. We found on every occasion all staff to be very friendly and helpful and able to speak good english throughout the parks and shops and restaurants. We have been in Disneyland Paris for Halloween, Christmas and St.Patricks day our favourite time is christmas when the 100%magic doubles if thats possible!! I would STRONGLY urge people not to visit during school holidays or summertime as during low season rides can still take up to 70minutes and double that in peak season!! Someday we will get to Florida but for now Disneyland Paris more than satisfies our appetite for all things Disney yes it is expensive but when you see your childs face light up and they beam with joy as they get a hug from their fave character its worth every penny !!!!",Disneyland_Paris
155881768,3,2013-3,United Kingdom,"First things first the positives: This park is not too big and is pretty well laid out. It also looks great both by day and night. The facilities are generally good, although toilets are not always very easy to spot. The park is mainly geared towards younger children and the parade and dream shows were very good so make sure you bag yourself a good spot early for these. We took advantage of a cheap Sun promotion for day passes, and got lucky with the weather and this really made it worthwhile.The negatives: Be prepared to queue for even the most basic fairground rides, many of which were simply not worth it. The Snow White and Pinnochio rides spring to mind as these were nothing more than old fashioned train rides that rushed through story book theming at breakneck speed Also bearing in mind that we visited on a weekday out of season and it was still crazily busy. Other than in the parade there were very few characters around the park which was disappointing, and some of the theming is not very  Disney , especially since I imagine most kids won't have seen Swiss Family Robinson or the old wild west films and cartoons. Kids could easily get lost in the maze of passages in adventureland that lead to precisely nowhere and the rides there were few and far between. The ratio of gift shops and food outlets to rides seems to be about 3 to 1 and both are hideously overpriced (but we knew to expect this). We only had a day there and while it was a long day, we easily covered the park in this time. I don't know what you would do with 3 or 4 days here. The quality of the rides is generally disappointing and they seemed to be really spread out. I have never queued for 45 minutes before to go on a lousy spinning teacup ride that lasted all of about 30 seconds, even on the busiest weekend in the height of summer. The extra magic hours you get for being a guest in a Disney hotel are not much of a perk because by 9am the park was very busy, and the queues already unreasonable. The FastPass system is a good idea, but in practise it is not that convenient to have to go to the ride just to get a pass to return later. Also you can only have one fast pass at any time and if the queues are long, the fast passes will run out quickly. We did this for Thunder Mountain and it worked out ok, but mostly because that was really the only ride we wanted to go on.Overall for us the good just about outweighed the bad and we had an enjoyable day but instead of come back here for a few days I would much rather save up and go to Florida and do it properly.",Disneyland_Paris
155872929,4,2012-9,United Kingdom,"My wife and I took our two grandchildren to Disneyland Paris , one age three and a half the other five years old. They both loved every minuet of the trip, we even had to stay up for the light show which was fantastic.We found it very expensive and not as good as the Disneyland in Florida were we had taken our son when he was five up to twelve years old.But overall our two girl,s loved it so it was worth doing.",Disneyland_Paris
155693102,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,This park is just fantasy for small children. There is so much to do and see. We found planning our day around the parades and character appearances worked really well so we could see and do everything without going back and forth between the different areas. Be warned though that everything will take twice as long as you think. The only thing that I was disappointed about was that were no characters just wandering around the park. If you don't make the effort to go to the planned appearances you are unlikely to see a character. Food is a bit disappointing in the park but we learned quickly to pack a lunch at breakfast at the hotel. Start queuing for the parades early as the route gets very congested. There are so many good rides and attractions for little ones here. I would recommend allowing at least 3 days to make the most of it.,Disneyland_Paris
155667973,5,2013-3,South Africa,"This was our first visit and we will definitely come again, everything is so slick and beautifully done.  The attention to detail is astounding.  We had an absolute blast and were sad to leave.",Disneyland_Paris
155627787,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Fabulous rides, they have a system called Baby Switch allowing one parent to queue up for a ride and then receive a ticket which they could then pass on to the other parent for the other parent to go straight on without queuing!",Disneyland_Paris
155607977,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Went for 2 days in march, took 2children 7 and 23 months it was cold you need to wrap up. The castle as you first walk in to disneyland is good and the kids eyes lit up. Some good rides which you will have to que for unless you have fast pass therefore it may only be 10 minutes or it will tell you a time to come back but not all rides are fastpass also you can do a baby swap were 1 parent and child can ride then the other parent can go on with the child save having to que up again. It's hard to get round everything in one day as the cold got to us especially the baby and our feet were tired. The 2nd day we went to universal next door which I thought was a bit better because there are more rides closer together (not so much walking). Expect to pay double for something to eat than you would at home not a lot of healthy stuff either burger and chips basically. On the whole it's a great place I'd like to go back to do stuff I didn't get round to doing and my 7 year old couldn't get on space mountain or Indiana jones ride he wasn't big enough. The French well some are nice some not. There was 1 person in front of us in the que to see mickey as we got near the front this person let 5 members of the family in front of us so we told the staff and they said this is allowed. I don't think this is very fair. Any how there's something for everyone we had a good time you need to go for more than 2 days tho.",Disneyland_Paris
155601776,4,2013-3,Singapore,"Large park, enough rides to spend 2 days. Food, surprisingly, was pretty good, better than other Disney Parks we've visited before. Hint: try the Angus burger.The Disney Dreams show at park closing time, is worth watching, projected onto the Cinderella castle, with accompanying fireworks and jets of flame.",Disneyland_Paris
155577824,3,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Euro Disney is a well run venue. We had a fantastic time here with the queues not as long as we thought they would be, but the few that were longish moved relatively quickly so you never got bored.My only points that were disappointing at this venue are:My friends car was keyed in a visible place in the car parkMore signs should be added from Calais as it is pretty hard to find without good directionsThe signs we did see need a clean as they were all pretty grubbySo although once in Disney the venue is fantastic, getting to Disney is not very magical at all.",Disneyland_Paris
155530290,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"We had a great time here in a cold week in March. The park was looking great, the staff were all helpful and friendly   I am not sure what they have for breakfast to make them all so chirpy but most people should have this!We went previously two years ago and I was not looking forward to the queues, but this was so much better than before   probably because the weather wasn't as nice. The 'big rides' were great, we particularly liked Pirates of the Caribbean which had hardly no queue and I enjoyed both Space Mountain 2 and Indiana Jones with a straight 'walk on'. Big Thunder Mountain and Buzz Lightyear were family favourites and we made use of Fast Pass for this, and I would highly recommend this.The shows were excellent, both the 5pm parade but particularly the evening light and fireworks show   absolutely superb. One thing (probably being British) is that there is a complete absence of understanding what personal space is   where on the map does this get lost? Also, the characters are far less evident now and it is a bit of a 'free for all'   and anyone over the age of (say) 16 should be a little embarrassed to be pushing themselves to the front ahead of young children for photos. I'm not sure why some grown men feel the need to do this, they probably need more sport and beer in their lives...!Anyhow, to finish on a positive   our family had a great time at Disneyland Park and some great memories were made.",Disneyland_Paris

155439278,5,2012-5,United Kingdom,While visiting Paris the Disneyland is a place you just simply can't avoid! Especially when you have kids with you. Fantastic place to spend the whole day or even few days... Parades are of course obligatory and all the other atractions too. If you have kids you won't probably miss buying miki or minnie doll :) We had an amazing day in Disneyland and I am sure that my kids won't forget it!,Disneyland_Paris
155398551,4,2013-2,United Kingdom,"Disneyland Paris is, as you would expect, very popular no matter what time of year you choose to go. Be prepared to freeze in the winter months as you will still spend a vast period of time in queues for all the rides. Ski clothing is probably best advised for this time of year and don't forget gloves, hats and scarves, we forgot the gloves and the parks had sold out of gloves the weekend we were there.Do research before you go, if it's your first time, to see which rides you are likely to want to go on and if they offer a 'fastpass' system (not all the rides do!). Make sure you are in the park as close to opening as possible and prioritise your first ride to being one of the (likely) most popular rides as this is when the queues will be at their shortest. I wanted to go on Crush which is in the Studio park but as I was the only one in our party who wanted to go on it this ride was left until later inthe day when the queue was over 1.5 hours. I never did get on it. It is advisable to then use the fastpass system as much as possible but be aware you can only hold a fastpass for one ride at any time so once you've got a fastpass on your ticket you will not be able to get one for another ride until that time slot has expired. Also once all the fastpasses have been issued for the day the system stops. This can be as early as 2pm. It will be a very long day, especially of you stay to the very end when there is a light & fireworks show. It's certainly worth staying for if you can especially if you have children with you who still enjoy firework displays.Take in as much food & drink as you can as buying in the park is expensive. You will also be faced with a shop at the end of most rides and photos are taken on many rides too.All in all, a couple of days in the park is tiring, fun and probably expensive, the kids enjoy it which is the main thing but the credit card can be hit hard. Using a credit card to pay for as much as possible does bring home how much you've spent when the statement arrives : (",Disneyland_Paris
155356758,3,2013-3,United Kingdom,"This park is more for young children, you must see both the parades which are on around 11am and at 5pm. We waited over 70 mins to see the princesses which was abit of a letdown tbh. You get to see one princess and cant really choose as they hush you in different queues. They change every 30 mins so you may not see someone you wanted. I feel the park is quite visually appealing but quite outdated and needs more new attractions. Disney dreams is on at 8pm weekdays and is worth it. Older people may find the studios more appealing.",Disneyland_Paris
155301018,5,2012-7,Germany,we choose to go on a working day... as we were aware it is hugely populated on weekends and holidays and it paid off well... we searched on net which rides are to be taken and we just followed our schedule ... we had to wait not more than 20 minutes in each rides and also we utilised the fast pass which was good. we did all the heroic rides and also in the second half covered the walt disney studios... even at our age level we enjoyed the rides .. must visit this attraction if your are in paris plan before to enjoy the place otherwise u will be lost in the park.,Disneyland_Paris
155192638,1,2013-3,United Kingdom,Went to Disney Land Paris last weekend with my 5yr old daughter and my mother. Can only say that it was a massive disappointment. The service levels were poor and the queues for all of the attractions were massive. A photo with Mickey mouse entailed an 80 minutes queue which could not be avoided as my daughter was mad to meet the characters and this proved quite challenging. To get on even the small rides involved queueing for not less than 40 mins for 2 minute rides.I had promised that we would do lunch with the Disney Princess which we booked at the Auberge de Cendrillion. We had a half board package and were told that although the vouchers would not cover the whole cost we could pay the difference. However once seated we handed over our vouchers to be told that they were not usable in this restaurant although we had made the reservation at 'City Hall' by one of the Disney staff. This was our last day so we ended up having to pay 65 euros each for the adults and about 30 euros for my child and having an unusable voucher. The food was absolutely appalling I ordered venison and received pork fillet! I would say that the princesses were lovely and my little girl enjoyed it but to have to spend 150 euros as that was the only way for her to get to meet the princesses is absolutely disgusting! We spent 2 full days in the park and in that time the only character I saw walking around the park was The Mad Hatter in the far distance. For young children the magic is in seeing and meeting the characters and for there not to be any to be seen makes the advertising somewhat misleading! We went into several cafes and only on one occasion were we actually able to sit down in the cafe to consume what we had bought as there is insufficient seating for the volumes of people. On the first day we went to buy a hot dog and fries for my daughter from one of the cafes and had to queue for nearly 30 minutes in a queue with only 6 people in it and then she had to eat it in the street as there was nowhere to sit. It would seem that once they have got you into the park they do not feel it is necessary to offer any level of customer service at all.All in all I would say save your money and add a bit to it and go to Florida. By the time we had paid for all of the extras it cost nearly   2k and was absolutely not value for money!!,Disneyland_Paris
155147086,4,2013-3,Indonesia,"Its all the same all over the world, which is not a bad thing of course. Im just saying if youve visited one, youve basically in a grand scheme of things been to all. Same feel, almost same attractions, almost same layout. Its the Disney blue print replicated all over their other parks worldwide. But of course one must visit.",Disneyland_Paris
155139248,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"yes there are queues, but thats what you expect from any attraction, its always worth the waiting to see your children grandchildren's faces. we queued over an hour to see a princess, again worth it when my granddaughter saw the princess, you don't know who you are going to see as they change, she saw Tiana, but they spend time with them and sign autographs and you can take pics as well as a photographer taking them, with the option to purchase on your way out. it would be nice to see more than one princess, but i suppose people would be waiting longer, but the wait is inside so its not that bad and she actuallly had a nap while we were waitingwe enjoyed it, they only thing with paris is its so cold and tried snowing several times so you really need to be well wrapped up.",Disneyland_Paris
155114715,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"Me and my sister went to Disneyland Paris for a day on the way back home after a week in Cannes in February.We started our day by going into the Disneyland Hotel since they have quite a few characters to meet inside in the morning. We met Pluto first and then queued up again when Eeyore came out, because he is one of my favorite characters. And then just before it was our turn to meet him, Rabbit joined him and we got to meet them both! I was well made up and already I was happy with how my day was going. And then as we walked out we ran straight into Mickey. We then went to Walt Disney world to go on the ride Crush's Coaster since it's one of our favorites. But unfortunately they had some problems with it while we were queueing, so we had to leave it. Me and my sister rushed over to The Rock and Rollercoaster, again another one of our favorites and got on it almost straight away.Happy with what we had done in Walt Disney, we walked back over to the Disneyland park and went straight over to Casey's corner to meet Winnie The Pooh.We then, went into Fantasyland where we found Tigger. People usually push, especially parents. They push their children towards the characters and obviously it's very annoying, because everyone wants to meet them. But usually if you stand patiently and don't push the characters will chose you. The characters don't like having children thrust at them either and they usually, push kids back if they dont think its their turn yet. If you wait, you'll get your turn. We then saw Esmerelda and Quasimodo. But they were running and seemed to be going back inside and didn't get to meet them. But we went to the Princess Pavilion and I got to meet Rapunzel, my favorite disney princess. I met her before in the summer with Flynn, but it was good to see her again. She was so kind and lovely and made sure to ask about my day and if I was having fun. We took a few pictures and then she gave me a hug.We then went on It's a Small World, which is always a great ride. The song is catchy and you can't help but sing. Pirates of the Carribean was closed, but we went on the ship in Adventure Land. We came out and by this time is was lunch time and we were getting hungry. Most places in Disneyland is expensive. Like any other theme park, food is going to be expensive. Admittedly, disneyland food is a little overpriced, but if you know where to go to get good deals, you'll be alright. We went to Toad Hall. If you get Meal 2 Double Fish and Chips, you get 2 fish, a large portion of chips, a large drink and 3 mini muffins for almost 12 euros, and its plenty for 2 people. So me and my sister payed 6 euros each. After we ate, we were walking towards discovery land when suddenly we saw green. My sister grabbed me and we ran. It was Peter Pan! Another one of my favorites. Its been my dream to meet Peter Pan before I turned 18 because I needed to tell him to take me neverland so I don't ever have to grow up. I didn't think I would ever get that chance since I'm 17. I met him and he talked to me for a good 10 minutes about Happy thoughts and pixie dust, and in the end he hugged me and I started crying. After meeting him I know now that I don't ever have to grow up. Afterwards we went on Peter Pans flight. It seemed appropriate. We then went to Discovery land and went on Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast. Another park favorite. Then we went to Frontier Land to go on Phantom Manor. They were having some technical difficulties with it, but feeling fully happy with everything else that we had done we decided to wait to see if they could fix it. And surely enough 15 minutes later it was up and running and we got on it straight away! Then we went back down to Main Street to find somewhere to sit for the Disney Magic on Parade. We sat right at the top in the middle facing the castle, it was a perfect view to see the floats coming down. It was the fourth time me and my sister had seen it and we knew all the words to the song so we were singing along. When it had finished me and my sister got and pushed past everyone and ran over to Walt Disney world and to Crush's Coaster to see if it had been fixed yet. It was! And we got on it pretty quick too. And that was where we ended our Disneyland trip. We were pretty lucky with everything we did. Yes a few of the rides broke down and weren't working, but I honestly don't think thats a problem, because theres plenty of other things to see and do.",Disneyland_Paris
155100850,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Second visit to Disney with my 7 year old daughter. It is excellent. Very well maintained and fun for all ages. Do not go here if you do not have patience for queues! You queue to get into Disney Village, you queue to get your ticket, you queue to get into Disney, you queue for every single ride, you queue for food and you queue to get out. You don't have to queue for the toilets   there are loads of them! Would recommend allocating a member of your party to run around the park first thing and get fast passes for all the good rides. You need every riders ticket for a each fast pass. The food is very expensive. They have added a MacDonald's to the Disney village so if you want to save money go there. Its more expensive than a normal MacDonald's but much cheaper than anywhere else. There is a sandwich bar in the train station that is also pretty cheap in comparison to the Disney prices. Remember and pack a dressing up outfit for the kids   the prices of the outfits in the park are horrendous. This is an excellent but tiring and expensive trip. You will not be disappointed though.",Disneyland_Paris
155064397,3,2013-2,Netherlands,"BackgroundWe went in February during half term with 1 baby boy and a 4 year old girl for her birthday. Overall it   s the kind of place you can have a good time in after being there once and experiencing it and finding out the good and bad (basically I need to go again to enjoy it)! My experience was as follows.GoodCaf   Mickey   at 5.30 pm all the characters come in around my daughter was as happy as I   ve ever seen her. I recommend booking this when you arrive, we booked as a Birthday treat. The staff were very friendly too.The Parade   at the end of the day I recommend getting up by the its small world ride. Here you see the start of the parade, and get a good view as they come through the gate. My daughter loved thisThe Grounds are great it   s like movie set. My daughter loved running around the Pirate Coves.The night time show at the Castle     great spectacular. My daughter was very excited about this, and one time I really felt the big Disney experience.Hotel New York Did the job, looks like a 90s Cinema though. Poor breakfast though. I think it   s good to stay inside the park, and nip back and relax as required. BadCaf   Hyperion   Cold, expensive burgers and a 30 minute wait. The cheese hadn   t even melted it was so cold. About 35 euros for 2 burger meals   a kids meal. I couldn   t find anywhere to sit so I had to perch on a wall.Auberge de Cendrillion   A really bad experience I   ll do a separate review. Very poor quality and cold food, lacking in atmosphere. I was violently sick for 24 hours after eating the Salmon Tatare. My daughter enjoyed having a photo with the Princesses of course   .I enjoyed missing a whole day far less. Basically expensive, and far too formal to be fun.Fast Pass I was expecting to be able to get a few rides from one location and then plan your day. You have to go to each separate ride to get a ticket again it just adds to the hassle.Princesses   I saw Arial and Cinderella refuse to sign one girls autograph book. I   m not sure if they are told to only speak to people inside the Pavillion, but still would it have hurt them to scribble something? The poor little girls disappointed face and outstretched hands left a sour taste, and is one of the strongest memories I took away disgusting. Incidentally, it was around 75 minute wait for the Pavilion. I saw Belle running away the next day so it wasn   t an isolated incident.Excessive walking, queuing and hassle. I felt less of the magic of Disney and more of a cynical rip off. I knew it   s expensive but at least pretend it   s not all about the money.Push chairs and strollers have to be abandoned everywhere even restaurants. This didn't seem very child friendly to me, especially when your youngest is sleeping. We took a lock with us.Magic Hours If you can get up expect only half the park, and then half the rides to be open. This extends the queuing time, and you obviously can   t get on everything.Queuing In busy times you can queue for over an hour to get onto a 2 minutes ride.",Disneyland_Paris
155055568,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Another lovely trip to Disneyland Paris. Stayed in New York which was vastly superior to the Newport (which was awful last year). Hotel excellent and park itself as good as always. Still prefer the studios as it is just so magical and animagique is well worth watching as is the playhouse disney show and the stunt show. My top tip would be if planning on watching the wild west show don't bother to upgrade, not worth paying extra for.Just love Disney as although it isn't a relaxing holiday they do all the entertaining for me so it is well worth it and the parades and the firework spectacular are lovely.

154941684,1,2013-3,United Kingdom,"We booked our trip to Disneyland Paris to the Disney Hotel Cheyenne. The hotel was basic but comfy but no tea or coffee in the room only a kettle, went to get some just to find it was 8 Euros for 4 tea bags, milk and sugar......That's where it started. If I said 5 Euros for a can of Coke you might get the idea, or maybe 20 Euros for 2 hotdogs and a drink Ouch! You get the feeling you're a captive audience and they milk you for all you're worth.We went during a patch of bad weather and although we can understand the ride not running in snow and ice later in the week the sun came out and rides were still not going and also smaller indoor rides breaking down due to over use, on one day after the snow had past we counted 7 rides closed, you don't pay   2000 for this. On top of this the ground wasn't gritted and in some places very dangerous, you would think with the silly profits they make they could grit the paths.My advise? If you must go to Disneyland Paris buy drinks and snacks at the train station, eat at Rainforest Cafe or Planet Hollywood, they're not cheap but the service is great. Head to Val du Europe 1 train stop away for gift buying as Disney expensive. Above all try and save up and go to America.",Disneyland_Paris
154895464,4,2013-3,United States,"Stayed in March 2013. We stayed one night in a Disney Resort (see my other reviews) and two days in the parks.Overall I thought the park compared quite well with the US Disney World or Disney Land parks.Hard to comment on the lines since our main day in the park it was actually snowing a bit, but I overall they compared well to other times we have visited Disney World in December. Space Mountain had an average wait of 10 minutes or less, The Indian Jones ride was about 25 minutes. I was surprised that the longest waits were for rides like Peter Pan. Our kids like the bigger rides so this was to our advantage.The rides were quite similar to the other parks. Small World looked newer and you could see the white drop ceiling (didn't have the same feel). Space Mountain I think was better. More of a coaster. Indiana Jones coaster was fun, but short. Most of the other ones were very much like the ones you've ridden before.The smoking is what killed me. I could not believe they allow smoking anywhere in the park. We are waiting in line and there are people smoking on both sides of us. I was truly amazed that Disney allowed smoking in the park at all. It was difficult to escape from it in any line.The park maintenance isn't quite up to the standards of US resorts either. You can see broken or cracked bricks in places you know they wouldn't be allowed to remain in the US. The landscaping isn't up to the standard of other parks either.It was simple to get dining reservations. This is one thing that was very different from US resorts. If you have visited in the US you know how hard it is is to make dining reservations. We were able to get reservations at pretty much any time we wanted at any restaurant. I know it is the off season, but even at US resorts in the off season this can be a real challenge.Overall it was still a good experience.

154876550,3,2013-2,United Kingdom,"we went in the park over a few days and some of the big attractions were closed like pirates of the carribian and round the world in 80 days just to name all but a few. this really let the expereince down same again in here everything very expensive remember to go eaither full board or take your own food. they really do pull on the kids heart strings so be were its all about shopping the the main park really and nothing else ques int he main park between 1 to 2 hours and same again not even in season the best parts is the disney dreams at the park closeing time, the disney trains and the day parade",Disneyland_Paris
154781277,3,2013-3,United Kingdom,Another park badly affected by the weather. Should put some emphasis on more indoor attractions or multi attractions in one building. Most indoor space to be found in expensive Disney shops. Chines goods that can be purchased fro half the price in a supermarket selling Disney brands.,Disneyland_Paris
154774766,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,We stayed over the October holidays 2012. It was amazing my husband myself and my 6 year old daughter. To be honest my husband didn't want to go NOT HIS THING but he enjoyed the whole experience. The hotel was good theme cars choice of food was good and staff were friendly. The 2 Disney parks were good longest wait to get on the rides was 45 minutes. One ride broke down while in the queue but we got a ticket to fast track us to the front of another ride. Only thing I would say was a disappointment was the cost of food in the parks. For example 7 euro for a hot dog pure rip off if you ask me. But some people in the hotel would fill carrier bags full of rolls cold meat cheese and so on at breakfast to take to the park with them. CAN'T AFORD FOOD DON'T GO,Disneyland_Paris
154750309,2,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Having stayed at this park five times previously,we have seen how it has deteriorated. There used to be shows and also actors playing out scenes in various locations around the park. Now there is nothing. We stayed 11 13th March when it snowed but no effort was made to clear paths or get rides ready. Lots of attractions were closed or opened late, even the indoor rides. People were walking around wondering what to do with their time. We saw many people slip on the snowy paths. There are an abundance of shops selling overpriced goods in which people were crowded trying to keep warm. The cost of food is ridiculous. We had purchased food vouchers in advance which saved us a little bit of money. I would suggest eating at a restaurant that serves buffet so you can eat as much as you want. The Plaza restaurant was good in the Magic Kingdom as it caters for vegetarians as well. You need to book a time. We stayed at the Newport Bay Club this time. Previously we stayed at the Santa Fe. Our room was nicely decorated but a double bed is a little small for us as neither my husband or myself sleep that well. Our granddaughter enjoyed having a bed all to herself though. The swimming pool was too cold to play around in. We ate breakfast at 7.30am. Any later than this and you would have to queue. It was good to be shown to a table and to keep going back to the buffet. At the Santa Fe we had to get all the food at one go and then find our own table. Drinks were really expensive in the bar. We won't be going back to disneyland Paris again I don't think.",Disneyland_Paris

154677814,1,2013-3,United Kingdom,"My husband, 5 year old daughter went to Disney to celebrate his 40th and her dream to see Disneyland Castle. On arrival at the Disney hotel we were greeted Eeyore, all very excited and thought we were in for a great 5 days. Our room was nice but not really 5 star, public rooms were again pleasant but 5 star not really how I would imagine. Buffet breakfast lots of choice but not brilliant taste wise. Our first trip into the park was exciting and when we saw the castle we were all overjoyed, that was the end of the thrill, rides were disappointing, after queues of 45 mins to result in a 1.3 mins rides no fun, rides were closed, our fast track tickets not valid between 1   4 pm , and when we did manage to use them we still queued for 20 mins for a Peter Pan ride which was 70% in darkness with stars . At the end of every ride I wanted to tell the hundreds in the queue not to bother. After 2 days my little girl cried to go and wanted to stay in hotel and swim. The park lacked disney characters around the ark apart from the parade. So expensive , shops selling all disney wear , princess dresses between   65 and   100 , food awful and expensive , dinner with the princesses pre booked in UK , we saw 3 princesses and the bill with a bottle of wine   190. Everyone walked from one queue to the next with miserable faces, it was a dreadful expensive trip. A day would be long enough for anyone but I would never do it again. We were told breakfast with the characters, they didn't mention them being outside the breakfast room and having to queue for a photo, we were invited to upgrade on arrival for   200 , to have a fast track for all day, but lots of the rides did not have fast track. No no no don't go .",Disneyland_Paris
154624586,5,2013-3,Ireland,"Myself and my Friends spent the weekend in Paris. We spent the full Saturday in Disneyland.We arrived on Saturday morning at 10am and didnt leave till the last Metro at one.When we arrived we had our bag serched which was grand. We had printed out our tickets at home so we were ready to go. Tickets were 20th anniversary 59 euro deal which was GREAT! Tickets in and all free rides all day. Brill.  Tip. If you are printing your tickets at home make sure the bar codes are printed well as one of my friends found out the hard way that if they arent it can be a bit of a problem. She had issues getting in at first and then each time she wanted to 'Fast Pass' She had to get a staff member.Fast pass is great but sadly you can only fass pass one thing at a time. But it is still worth it.We went on all the big rides. Space mount, tower of terror and the likes. Yes the ques were big but it was worth the wait. There are new Toy Story rides which were UNREAL. Everyone should go on. RC was the best! Unreal good laugh.The food is a pricey. We were sorry we didnt bring a packed lunch which would of been fine.But other then that it was the best day. The show at the end alone was worth the 59euro we paid in so it was a great day all in all.After the park closed we headed to Disney Village. For small children at the end of the night this is a NO but for us with No kids it was a YES YES YES. Chicken wings and cocktails for less then 20 euro is right up my street.Last metro at 1.00.We had a great day and think No matter what age you are you will have a GREAT time at Disneyland.Just make sure you wear comfortably shoes as you will be standing alot of the day :)",Disneyland_Paris
154624505,4,2013-3,Ukraine,Was there with family and 2 kids in spring '13. The 2 parcs are very good. But waiting time to do an attraction of 1 2mn is huge (30 45mn minimum). There is the possibility to get  fast pass  to avoid waiting but there are some limitation that you must understand in advance...Great evening closing show but the daily Disney Parad is disappointing. Disney is keeping too much heroes from disney cartoons who are no longer well known and attracted kids. While the presence of their last films heroes is very low. Staff was always nice and helpful.,Disneyland_Paris
154623995,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"It was magical for my child, he absolutely loved it and still talks about it yet! But for me and my husband we went to Disney World in Florida for our honeymoon and the two parks were a completely different experience! First of all, Paris is a complete rip off, the food was terrible and the price of it was ridiculous, we ate the best of steak and crab cakes in Florida and it was for nothing, really great value, the people in Paris nearly fell into my child's pram and would overtake you in queues (really bad mannered) had no time for my child in the park and in Florida the people made the whole disney experience magical! I got on the train in Disneyland Paris, carrying my child, cases and a folded up buggy and the door automatically shuts, it shut on the backpack I was wearing and not one person on the train got up to help me they watched in their seats as my husband tried stepping over and avoiding falling over their suitcases they have blocking the aisles! I now have two children and would them to go back there and I probably would but I will know better than to expect help from anyone there! Scary experience at times but kids love it!

154427244,5,2012-11,United Kingdom,Arriving on Main st to see the massive Christmas tree and all the decorations was just breathtaking!

154286653,5,2013-3,United Kingdom,The park is just fantastic you just get into a Disney Mode of life. OK they have got you with the price of food and drink.

Every shop in mainstreet has a hidden mickey in there decor. Everywhere in the Parc you can see these hidden mickeys. In the waiting lines you also can see a lot of hidden gems. You must open your eyes while walking in the parc to see all the small details, and to notice all the hidden gems.Ofcourse we did the attractions and show also, but after doing the guided tours you watch and join the things on another way.

Rooms are bog standard,stayed in sequoia last time and this time New York hotel, no difference just the theme. Won't waste my money again on Paris again id rather take my family to America.",Disneyland_Paris
154162939,4,2013-3,United Kingdom,"Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said? Both parks (Walt Disney Studios, and Disneyland Park) offer plenty of fun for all ages   tip: Disneyland Park (the Fantasyland section in particular) offers the best attractions for very young visitors. Walt Disney Studios is more focused on bigger thrills (and behind the scenes attractions, such as studio tours and exhibitions), though Toy Story Playland is suitable for little nippers.We did find a small number of attractions to be closed   notably in Frontierland and Adventureland, though this wasn't particularly important to us, as our little girl has just turned 3, and couldn't have ridden on most of the closed rides anyway. If you're travelling with little ones, Fantasyland is where you'll spend most of your time!The only points of criticism I have are:1) the very long queues for many rides, including rather mundane kiddy rides, which involves shuffling along for up to an hour (more in some cases)   not good when you're visiting with a toddler. We visited during early March 2013, which I now know is the 'winter holiday' for large numbers of French school children, which may explain the queues. I understand that DLP cannot necessarily prevent queues (restricting entry numbers would lead to many a disappointed child), yet perhaps more can be done to make the queues themselves more 'entertaining'. For example, at Mickey's House (where you meet Mickey Mouse), queues are long, but there is a constant show of cartoons on a big screen, interspersed with live entertainment every 30 minutes or so. Most other attractions offer no such diversions.2) The wait for Princess Pavilion (in Fantasyland) where visitors can enjoy a little 1 2 1 time with Disney Princesses, was constantly unacceptably long. Every time we checked, the wait was 90 120 minutes, which few very young children can tolerate. As above, it WAS peak time, and queues were expected. However, perhaps DLP could put on a few more princesses at peak time   I'm sure 99% of little girls wouldn't mind meeting ANY princess, and with a little planning and behind the scenes magic, DLP could have presented multiple 'identical' princesses at the same time, without spoiling the illusion. Unfortunately we had to give the Princesses a miss, due to travelling with a 3 year old. The alternative would have been to book a Princess dining experience, however prices are extremely high, and the food on offer does not seem to be suitable for very little ones who usually do not have the most refined pallets.All in all, we enjoyed our visit to both of the parks, Disneyland Park in particular, where we spent two days. Thankfully we were able to gloss over the lack of princesses, as our little one is of the age where she can still be easily hoodwinked! Slightly bigger girls may be very disappointed, though, yet may be better equipped to brave the 2 hours' wait. The best attractions for little ones (with the shortest queues!) are as follows:  It's a Small World  Mad Hatter's Teacups  Alice's Curious Labyrinth  Storybook Land(?)  Circus Train  Horse CarouselAnd of course...the Princess Castle!!Longer queues can be found at:  Princess Pavilion (as above!)  Peter Pan's Flight (we had to give it a miss due to constant long lines)  Dumbo's Flying Elephants (inexplicably popular, as it's not much good!)  Mickey's House (but worth the wait, as entertainment is provided whilst queuing)As we visited during the 20th year (just...), we got to see the nightly Disney Dreams show, which was very good, visually. However, be aware that you MUST be inside the park prior to closing time (7pm in our case) in order to catch the show...But the show doesn't start until 8pm! Since our little girl couldn't sit stand in one spot for an hour, we didn't get the best 'seat' (it's open air) in the house, but we enjoyed some shopping (well played, Disney!!) whilst waiting, and still managed to get a reasonable view of the display.",Disneyland_Paris

The way it works is basically you get a fast pass from one of the rides which is busy..you would then get an allocated time and you have to be there at the exact specific time for the ride.When we went to Disney land , they were celebrating the 20th anniversery.Some restuarants are highly prices , however you would be able to see others as well.",Disneyland_Paris

154019551,3,2013-2,United Kingdom,"We've been to Disneyland Paris on a number of occasions and we we're disappointed this time. Three of the big rides (Pirates Autotopia Small World) were closed which I found strange for half term week. There doesn't seem to have been much of a change for the 20th anniversary.When we first visited a few years back, it was great to see the characters popping up in various places across the park. It made for a nice surprise and added to the magic. This time the characters only seemed to appear during the train parade. You now queue to see the princesses and Mickey and have your picture taken, but this was just an excuse to charge you for the photos they take (you can take your own).There seemed to be little in the way of celebration of 20 years. The attention to detail is missing, they were even selling popcorn in Christmas cups! And prices had rocketed. For example, character autograph books are 5 euros, the same prices they were on previous trips, but this time they contain less than half the pages. A Star Wars Lego advent calendar dated 2012 was on sale for 49.99 euros (the same thing was   19.99) just before xmas.We didn't have to battle with queues as my wife is disabled so our disappointment is nothing to do with busy.On a plus side, the light show was spectacular.We love Disney and the magic is brings, it is sad to see that it has become more about making money than making people smile.",Disneyland_Paris
153963342,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,Enjoyed our trip. Was cold and a few attractions closed. However we had sun most of the week which really helped take the chill off. This is Disney and just a hop across the channel.Queues not too bad. Not as organised with baby swap as Wdw and not as bubbly as the yanks but it's pretty much the same kind of thing. Certainly these too parks seem a lot bigger than hong kong Disneyland. Enjoyed the evening fireworks and show. Parades were a bit on the small side and over In a flash but kids loved it.Only downside was the obscene food prices. 4 euros for a can of pop. Fortunately we made a picnic from our hotel brekky and took plenty of drinks fruit In. Although caught out first day. 10 euros for 8 chicken nuggets and a tiny portion of fries.Think Walt Disney world is incomparable and better value for money with four parks and two water parks on the two week ticket works out at approx   16 a day.Combined this with a trip sightseeing impairs and a trip to Versailles on way home so a great but very tiring trip another tick for the bucket list!,Disneyland_Paris

153706432,5,2012-9,Philippines,We came to Paris with no plans to visit Disney ( we thought its only for kids) But we have 1 extra day and no where to go.. Decided to catch the train to Disney and we had fun!! Nice crazy rides... Few of them you need to wait 20  30 mins for a ride. But still fun.. Nice souvenir shops.. Food are pricey.. The best part was the castle.. I LOVE IT! I thought I was 5 years old again...,Disneyland_Paris
153683949,3,2013-2,United Kingdom,"Firstly I have to admit to have visiting Disney in Florida many times, I didn't expect The Paris park to be the same but assumed that there would be some sort of similarity, after all Disney must have some sort of magic formula? Wrong! The park looked very impressive, absolutely beautiful but other than that there was absolutely no comparison!We arrived in heavy snow and the rest of the week, though dry (thank goodness!) was very cold. Obviously the weather can't be controlled but it did illustrate a few major problems. All of the eating places are too small, there is plenty of outside seating that I'm sure would be lovely on a nice day but having to feed a 2 year old rapidly cooling, overpriced food in the freezing cold is upsetting given the cost of our trip. There is no outside heating in these eating areas and not even any shelter or nowhere to try to get warm. I imagine the lack of shelter would be just as frustrating in the summer. I had a problem with the smoking in the park too, like Disney in the US the Paris park requests smoking to take place in designated areas only, evidently the French don't think that matters and guests smoke wherever they please, including in queues for rides which I think is unacceptable as the second hand smoke is impossible to avoid. Where are Disneyland staff and why is this tolerated?We found several rides broken down and others where the fast pass machines were not working, staff were not particularly helpful and treated the breakdowns lightly. The queues were quite long but not as bad as some other reviewers have experienced, that said we didn't really go on any of the bigger rides as we were more concerned with our 2 year old daughters needs and stuck to the teacups and Small World!I was disappointed at the lack of Disney characters around the park, meeting points were completely focused on money making from photograph sales. I expected for 'less important' characters to be dotted round the park but we saw nothing until the Friday.We waited to meet Mickey (30 mins) and my Daughter was delighted and met Minnie at the Studio park, waiting even less time which was great but other than that there was either no opportunity to meet anyone or the queues were ridiculous. I had hoped for her to meet a Princess but the Princess Pavilion wait time never went below 75 mins (far too long with a 2 year old when you have to leave the buggy outside!) so she had to be content with a quick glimpse as they walked onto or out of the pavilion without even acknowledging any of the star struck children!All in all there is very little of the Disney Magic, a few of the staff we came across tried hard and that was appreciated but couldn't make up for the general air of nonchalance. I'm just glad our Daughter was far too young to notice and enjoyed herself! 'You can design and create and build the most wonderful place in the world, but it takes people to make the dream a reality' Walt DisneyI'm pretty sure he wouldn't be impressed!",Disneyland_Paris
153624276,4,2013-2,United Kingdom,Pros:  Fun for all ages   Clean   Disney magic!   Cons   Lots of rides break down ( big thunder mountain closed all 3 days consistently breaking down.   Expensive Food   Long queues   But overall great!!,Disneyland_Paris
153607621,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"We travelled here in February half term, the weather was freezing but no rain. The Disneyland park itself is magical, also so clean there's always staff picking up litter. There were a few rides closed over the 5 days we were there, which was a little disappointing, but still plenty to do. Food is expensive but you can eat cheaply too, I would recommend the Earl of Sandwich in the Disney village. Also the market deli on Main Street. The studios park was also very clean and seemed to be the quieter park, with rides more catered for older children. We didn't have to queue for long in here except for Crush's coaster. We all enjoyed Cafe Mickey which although expensive is worthwhile for good food and amazing to see the characters without queuing.",Disneyland_Paris
153578686,4,2012-12,United States,"We came to France specially for Disney and the kids loved it. I've been to the Florida one years ago and for me this one is not as good for some reason, but having said that we all enjoyed the Disney feeling! We went during the week so queues were not too bad and we missed the main holiday crowds. Food outlets bit pricey but overall a great place to visit and not far to get there.",Disneyland_Paris
153574756,4,2013-2,United Kingdom,"Had a great visit with our 2 year old son. With him being into everything Disney he really enjoyed it. On every full day we were there we made sure we were in the park for 8 to take advantage of the 2 hours without members of the public. This made the queuing alot less painful. Unfortunately one of mornings we went in early 3 of the rides that were open(not all the rides open before 10) were broken leaving you little to choose from but overall its worth going in early to avoid the queues. Some rides were closed for our entirety of our stay which was quite frustrating as if the queuing gets too frustrating for a 2 year old all your really left with is a glorified shopping centre with quite a few restaurants chucked in. On the plus sides, even though the park was busy it never felt over run with people. The staff were on the whole happy and willing to help. The parades were really good and the lights and fireworks at the end of the day were brilliant. The Buzz Lightyear Ride was one of my sons favorites, whilst my wife liked the Peter Pan ride and Its Small World Ride (Beware the theme songs sticks in your head forever . The restaurants were really good and the food was really tasty & the shops, all though all very similar were not in my mind particulary overpriced as you wouldn`t expect them to be cheap. Overall, a great experience but possibly only if you don`t mind queuing.",Disneyland_Paris
153546527,3,2013-2,United Kingdom,"We booked DLP for a short trip for our son's 11th birthday and took advantage of Kids under 12 stay and play for free. We have done DLP in 2000 with our oldest, so that park had obviously increased in size. The park offered what we expected but we did not get the  Disney Magic  we get when we go to Walt Disney World in Florida. The food was OK but was expensive. The merchandise was also very expensive. As we had booked a Disney Hotel we took advantage of the extra magic hours. It seems they have half the park closed and only open some rides to half capacity so your extra magic hours are spent in line for about and hour at a time waitiing to get on the rides. I suppose the holiday was OK but next time we will certainly be keeping our money for Florida where you get mcuh more for your money.",Disneyland_Paris
153544392,3,2013-2,United Kingdom,"We spent 4 days at Disney. We spent the Thursday in the park, Fri in the Studios and Sat Sun back in the park.I would advise anyone to avoid going to Disneyland at the weekend. If you can visit either when the schools are open or Mon Friday.The Saturday and Sunday in the Park were horrendous. Every ride we wanted to go on was 60 75 minutes. We queued to go to the Mickey Encounter the wait time was 75mins. I was happy to queue as it was SO cold. When we got to Mickey's room there was some limited Mickey props clothing. We were told we could take photos, but there was also an official photographer there so IMO this is just Disney being very opportunistic!The Disney Princess Q was also 75 mins on the Sunday.For the month of Feb the Pirates of the Caribbean was closed and I wonder if Disney reduce their capacity when rides are out of action? On the Saturday it was heaving I have never in the 3 previous visits seen Disney so busy.The parade at 5pm is nice, but not as long as I remember them being.The Birthday Train is not something to leave a Queue for to go and see it really isn;t anything special.The evening show is quite something and very clever.The kids had a wonderful time I think as parents we feel a little jaded and left feeling the 'specialness' had perhaps decreased at the expense of queuing so much.What I will say is we bought the full board package and used the 'En Coulisse' in the studios, Colonel Hathi and Hakuna Matata for lunch. All of which were excellent.",Disneyland_Paris
153513047,5,2012-4,United States,"The Disney Paris castle is incredible. I love all things Disney and this park did not let me down one bit. If you go expecting DisneyWorld you might be disappointed. Disney Paris is a different experience which to me is what makes it so wonderful. Instead of the walking under the railway to get to the park, you walk under the magnificent Disneyland Hotel. The gardens of course are very well kept. I think one thing that makes this park so different from the others is the characters they focus on. For example, they still have a large emphasis on classics like sword in the stone, Jungle book, and Robin Hood. Like I said... it's a different experience but that is a good thing!",Disneyland_Paris

153492636,5,2013-1,Australia,"I booked a tour to go to diensy land in Australia. When I got over to Paris, the day that I went to Disneyland, I got a taxi to drop me to the tour office. There was about 3 coaches that went to Disney land. It was about a 45min drive by coach to get there. Very Scenic. You arrive at Disney land and you get stop at these big gates. Once you go through the gates there are multiple car parks. Its a bit of a walk in to the actually parks and you have to go through multiple gates to get in. Once you get in there are alot of shops gift shops and food shops. They have 3 different kinds of food shop, all you can eat buffet, fine dining and burgers and stuff.If you go in the rain you will find that most of the larger rides will be closed. The good thing about Disney land is it has Disney studios right beside it. At Disney studio do a behind the scenes tour. Which is really cool. You should definitely take the time to see it.",Disneyland_Paris

The big let down is the food and drink vastly overpriced and pretty tasteless . We stayed in 2 hotels sequila lodge and cheyenne, pretty average for Disney overpriced to.

153274108,4,2013-2,United States,"Living in nearby Switzerland, my children were off for a week of school in February 2013. Also being from Florida, my children loved Disney World and Universal Studios. We got a good ticket deal for both parks, but found that the reason is that this is the off season. Good for quick(er) line waits, bad because it was cold, cold, cold!! Had a great time, but the usual Disney standard was lacking   the park employees were somewhat nice but not outgoing, cracks in some of the sidewalks, we ate a lunch and an employee went to retrieve a bag of garbage and the smell when he opened the can (inside the restaurant) was putrid beyond belief. Disney parks in the US have employees at every corner selling drinks, etc. not here. It was difficult to find a hot coffee or hot chocolate. It almost seemed like there was a subdued effort to sell the Disney experience. Space Mountain 2 was great   better longer ride, Indiana Jones ride was great. Some memories of home came back & was comforting. No flowers or beautiful landscaping to look at   guess this is difficult when the temperature is  5C. It was bizarre that on the Rock N Roll Roller coaster, Aerosmith influence was just a video of the band saying Hi & that was it. No music while waiting outside of some techno music. No music while riding the Roller Coaster. Otherwise, we would still go back   but maybe during warmer weather.",Disneyland_Paris
153236691,1,2012-8,United Kingdom,"My husband and I decided to surprise the children and take them to Disneyland Paris in the summer. I imagined it to be one of the most magical experiences they would have outside of Christmas. I was so wrong! I am so pleased we didn't stay in the resort, we couldn't wait to get away from the place...it would have been close to torture to have remained there for longer!We have 3 children, twins aged 5, and a 3yr old. We took a friend with us so that each child was looked after. I purchased 6 x 3 day passes which was around   800.00We visited August 2012. The place was so over crowded. We waited for 3 hours to get on the carousel and a further 3 hours to get on the Dumbo ride. 6 hours of cues and the temperature was 32 degrees. The food was terrible and they charged extortionate prices. The drinks and ice creams were around 5 euros each which add up when you have a family.We caught a glimpse of a few characters on a train. The place was so crowded.We were stupid enough to go back 2 days later to see if the other park was any better. This was even worse. Absolutely nothing for younger children other than the mickey mouse club house. We had waited for about 3 hours again, only to see a very short performance in an over crowded room.We had rented an apartment in Paris as the hotel was going to cost thousands for us all to stay for just 3 nights. It was the only thing that was bearable about this trip. I spoke to a few others at the airport who had been staying at the Disney resort. Everyone with whom I spoke said that they had had the worst holiday ever and felt completely ripped off. My only,advise I could give anyone is  don't go !!!! Save your money and go to Florida if you want to see Mickey Mouse. Please trust me, you will be disappointed and robbed!!This was the worst mistake I have made and I wouldn't dream of going back. It the most expensive Carousel and Dumbo ride we will ever have.",Disneyland_Paris

V.busy so lots of queuing, if you stay in a Disney Hotel you get 'extra magic hours' between 8 and 10am and it's well worth getting up early. We love Buzz Lightyear and space mountain.

153068294,2,2013-2,United Kingdom,"February half term for UK and France you would think most attractions would be open,but no,several restaurants were closed, some toilets were closed, several rides were closed, including the train round the outskirts of the park, so it was a case of you will walk if you want to go anywhere.We queued for over 30 mins to go on the Dumbo ride which had two dumbos covered over and not in use just as we got to the front of the queue the ride broke down and a family were stranded 20 feet up,the fire brigade had to rescue them. We then queued for Thunder Mountain, fourty mins into the queue, guess what, that broke down stranding people in their carriage,attraction closed. The weather was freezing so you would have thought there would be plenty of places selling hot drinks but no. As in my last review of this place,the park was a disgrace, litter around the rides looked as though it had been there for weeks and again the park was covered with cigarette ends, I can say this with certainty that some French people were smoking in the queues for the rides and not one Cast member challenged them. All in all very disappointed with Disneyland Paris I would rather have spent my   2000 somewhere else. Every time I say never again, this time I mean it.",Disneyland_Paris
153064318,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"Not just the kids loved it here but also us grown ups!! Felt the disney magic as soon as we entered, 20th celebrations all around you. Very busy as it was Uk half term, hence the reason for us being here!! Make the most of fastpass. Most of the water fountains have been turned off, very crafty as they want you to buy drinks, we found two fountains working so you can fill a bottle or two, one on left as you walk in before main entrance, and other in walk through as you go through ticket turnstiles on left. Well worth doing this as drinks for fam of four cost a lot!! We did every ride, loved them all. Show at closing time is a must and the parade. Also great to meet the characters, even our 11 yr old still loved doing this! We had to queue a lot for rides, but this didn't spoil our enjoyment. If you stay in a disney hotel like we did, def make the most of the magic hours, still busy but nowhere near as bad as when everyone enters at 10am. You can get so much done between 8 9am, just means you have to be organised, up early, brek and out the hotel, but so worth it. We only did it on two days as you will be so tired you need a bit of a lie in, and the kids!! Be prepared to take an awful lot of spending money, so overpriced it's just obscene!!

152995113,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"We stated our day with breakfast and then went to have some pictures with some characters who were outside they restaurant, We met pluto and then rabbit came out do we queued up again and then just as it was our turn, eeyore came out aswell    we then made our way into the park but as we was walking through the hotel we bumped into mickey so got another photo. We decided to go to WDS first and went to crush coaster but it was having some technical difficulties so ran over to rock and roller coaster (one of our favorite rides) and decided to come back to crush coaster later. We went back to find a big queue so made our way back to disneyland. We walked down main street and decided on Buzz. I love this ride, probably my favorite ride in the park as i keep trying to beat my previous score. We then went over to caseys corner for the winnie the pooh meet and greet and then to the AP office to get my annual pass, BIG QUEUE. When we came out made our was to fantasy land and on the way saw tigger so ran after him and got our picture quite quick. I have noticed that a lot of parents try and push thier kids for photos which doesnt work as they characters seem to pick the ones that arnt pushing, so just stand there patiently and you are probably more likely to be picked. Now this was the highlight of the trip, we was just walking to toad hall to get some lunch, when we saw green, me and me sister looked at each other and just ran, It was peter pan, we have always wanted to meet peter pan. Well anyway we were lucky enough to get a picture with him and he was amazing, one of the best face characters i have met. He spent time with us and asked us questions and was so great with the kids. So good that my sister started crying after. After this we danced our way to toad hall and got a double fish and chips to share, ( same amount as 2 seperate portions but for only 2 euro more than a single portion, probably the best value place) it was lovely, no room inside so sat outside, was a bit cold but the fish was cooked perfectly in herby batter. Oh i forgot to mention inbetween tigger and peter pan we went to the princess pavallion to meet a princess, you queue up but dont know which princess you are going to meet. We met Rapunzel who is our favorite princess. We then did peter pans flight and its a small world. We walked through to adventure land and as pirates was closed we looked around the caves and adventure isle, we skipped indian jones as its not one or our faves and carried on to big thunder mountain, where i got some abuse from a lady because she thought i was pushing in not knowing what i had done wrong i said sorry to the cast member and went to walk back but the cast member said where are you going you havent done anything wrong and told me me to stay where i was, to then see the woman pushing through people to come and stand behind me?!After this we had a stopoff and had a snack of some biscuits i had bought with me and then carried on to phantom manor. It was my first time going on it so wasnt sure what to expect but it is fine, not too scary and i wouldnt worry about taking small children on it. The parade was starting soon so decided to sit near the top of main street so we could run out at the end over to WDS so we could go on crush coaster. The parade was magical, i could seriously just go to disney and not do any rides, id be just happy walking around and watching the shows. When it finished we ran over to WDS and crush coaster and after a short wait got on the ride. Again a must, one of the best. It was now about 6 so went to meet our mum and got the shuttle to newport bay to have a meal at cape cod, on first look we wasn't to impressed but then when we stared eating it was quite a good buffet and left thinking its the best we have been to so far (plaza gardens, agrabah cafe, la cantina and the one in david crockets, cant remember the name)It was now time to make our way to the station for the journey backso untill next time, C'est dans la boite!",Disneyland_Paris

We didn't stay for the park closing show as we were too cold! All in all, we enjoyed ourselves because our daughter had a fantastic time.

Space Mountain at 2pm was only a 10 minutes ques. The parade was shown every 30 minutes which was great all the main Disney Characters were dancing around and even saw a special appearance from Clarice with Chip and Dale. The food is very expensive in this park so please be aware. Take your own drinks in as its 3 euros for a bottle of coke and 7 euros for a hot do at Caseys Corner. However this is very nice. The parks are very clean and lots of cast members are walking around the park each day. All rides were open apart from Pirates of the Caribbean which was getting refurbished and is closed throughout April. The only bad thing about this park and Walt Disney Studios is that there is no cast members with any characters. The characters are left to walk alone for them selves which I find very bad. So if you want your children to meet the characters book a meal at Cafe Mickey. Although some arnt such as Mickey, Buzz light year and Aladdin.

Best rides defintely are Space Mountain 2, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril (hardly any lines) and Great Thunder Rail Road.The rides that had long waits are the ones without fast pass, namely Pirates of the Caribbean.

A total waste of time and money. It is now a complete rip off and should be avoided. One hour, 20 minute queue for a 3 minute ride on the flying Dumbos (3 of the 16 pods out of commission). Best attractions such as Pirates of the Caribbean   Madhatter   s teacups closed (   for your future enjoyment   ). Most refreshment outlets closed. Only place to get warm was in the shops     all of them open! People were sitting on the ground outside the shops eating chips in the freezing cold. Despite advance tickets on a Times promotion you had to queue for an hour even to get into the park (only one window in three open). Attitude of staff:    We know it   s rubbish. We don   t care. We only work here. it   s not our fault   . On top of everything, no sign of Donald Duck or the others in the gang . . . the one thing our grandson had been promised. In the UK we probably would have a case for suing them for misrepresentation.",Disneyland_Paris
152786731,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"We had a great day there   we planned it with military precision! Fastpass has to be used to take full advantage of the park.As we went in February, we managed to get on everything we wanted to, had a great view of the 5pm parade by getting there early and thought the fireworks at the end of the day were amazing. If you do wait for them, get there early for a good view of THE WHOLE CASTLE   lots of the show happens on the castle entrance, and both my kids were too small to see it.Lots of walking round, be prepared to queue for the popular rides, but we did it, loved it and have the sore feet to prove it! Take snadwiches and drinks with you as everything is inflated prices. 4 euros for 1 candy floss stick...never even looked at the restaurant food prices!The look of joy on the kids faces during the 5pm parade had me on the verge of tears, as did son getting a cuddle from Chewbacca. Loved it.",Disneyland_Paris
152774621,2,2013-2,United Kingdom,"Big queues and absolutely ridiculous prices for food and drink. Seriously, If you think food drink prices are bad in UK theme parks     be prepared for a shock.Whole areas closed. Individual rides closed. Rides breaking down. Very few rides open till 10:00 even though guests of Disney hotels are told it opens at 8:00 for them.",Disneyland_Paris
152774116,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,"Disneyland Paris was an amazing holiday, and although it was freezing cold, once you worked out how many layers you had to wear it was great!We went just before christmas and it was just wonderful. The entire place made you feel so christmassy you could barely stand it! All of the staff were so so lovely, characters were seen throughout the parks and the rides were great fun.Queuing was a slight issue, but as I and my sister were teenagers there wasn't too much hassle. I can imagine with younger kids it could be a nightmare, especially if you only go for a day as there is so so much to do!Overall, one of my fondest memories and ones I will treasure forever.",Disneyland_Paris
152734426,4,2013-2,Norway,"Spent a very enjoyable day out here today with hubby and 2 kids. If you buy the Francophile tickets on the french site then you pay     35 per adult, which is much cheaper than the regular price. We got the deal where one child under 12 went free for every paying adult which made this a great bargain day out from cental Paris. Despite the freezing cold weather we had a great time. The rides were busy, but not too busy.. The longest waiting time was 60 mins for the Indiana Jones ride. The 5 o 'clock parade was lovely as was the Disney Magic firework and light show at closing time. A great place to spend the day, wouldn't come here for a holiday in it's own right, but certainly worth it for a day trip from Paris if already there.",Disneyland_Paris
152733004,1,2013-2,United Kingdom,"I took my 2 children to Disney land expecting a magical dream! How wrong was i !! 2 hour ques for rides!! we managed to get on 5 rides in the 2 days we were there, or should i say 4 and a half as one ride broke down with us on it, we was then told that we could have a fast track ticket to compensate us for the inconvienience to then be questioned and called a liar by staff saying they didnt believe we had even been on the ride!! 26 Euros on 2 signiture books for 2 signitures!!! My 6 year old son and 8 year old daughter was in the que for a signiture off Daisy Duck, when a member of staff came over with a card, handed it to a member of staff stood with Daisy Duck and physically pushed my son backwards shouting   special child coming threw!!  my 2 children and all the other children who had been waiting patiently in the que had to stand back and watch this so called   special child  push in front of them and have their book signed and photos taken with her!! They also close off an area for the charactors with only certain children being let threw in front of all the other children, clearly if you want to meet the charactors then you pay extra!!! if you havent got the money then your children get pushed to one side and watch the  special  children meet them!! I dont remember seeing disney advertise this in their magical adverts!! The food is very expensive and NOT worth what you pay, 13 euros for hotdog and fries, (not including a drink!) On the way home i asked my children if they enjoyed themselves, my son informed me that next year he would rather go Butlins!!! This was an experience i never wish to experience again!!",Disneyland_Paris
152726063,5,2012-6,France,"This was our fourth visit and so far haven't tired of it. Disney's magic is just brill. The place is huge and to cover it all would take at least a couple of days. Thunder Mountain is an absolute must together with It's a Small World. Haunted House is also a must visit. Lots of walking, plenty of Disney characters and photo opportunities. Food is on the expensive side but there are plenty of picnic areas in order to take your own.",Disneyland_Paris
152706684,5,2012-6,United States,"we had returned to disneyland paris to celebrate our 10 year anniversary with our 3 children and a cousin. the park had changed quite a bit since we had gone there and to paris for our honeymoon! we stayed at the disneyland hotel which was amazing! being able to walk out the doors and be right at the gate was awesome! the park is beautiful! the cast members in general (there were some exceptions) lack that warm, welcoming attitude you find at disneyworld orlando  the other tourist were down right rude! push and shoving  no gratitude for holding a door for them. we were waiting for an elevator literally standing in front of it and when it arrived another family came charging up trying to get again  i had to block them and say you're after us  we had a group of six with two strollers  the french and those from great britain were super nice  others, not so much! we are generally pretty easy going but this near pushed us over the edge! as for the park itself, our kids loved the alice in wonderland maze  this is a must do!! as is the casey jr train, our boys loved this very much! space moutain is unlike any other  it goes upside down! the adults in our group all loved it! the castle and it's surrounding landscaping is fairytale and cartoon like! it's like nothing you've ever seen  simply breathtaking! going into the dungeon is a must do  the dragon is amazing! the pirate ship playground and skull rock with it's caves were right up the kids alley with the new jake and the neverland pirate show they watch on disney junior  however some class less folks had used the skull rock as their personal urinal  it smelled so bad we couldn't stay in there. disneyland paris should install cameras in there and remove anyone ( and their party and revoke their tickets) who thinks it's ok to urinate in public where children play!! overall this place is magical! we love disney and were going to paris and knew we had to come here too!",Disneyland_Paris
152686953,3,2013-2,United Kingdom,"Half term week and we were surprised that not that many characters were around. But, usual fun had by all. Fantasyland had the most to do. Quite a few rides shut down which is not acceptable during half term. Lots of food outlets shut too which meant looooong queues for anything to eat or drink. The new parade is a lot shorter than the old one and the characters just don't seem to be as accessible   they used to get off the floats and come and meet the crowds, now they just sit and wave.The evening firework show is stunning, but get a good spot as need to be able to see the castle   not just the sky as we thought.",Disneyland_Paris

152510254,2,2013-2,United Kingdom,"I booked a trip for my daughters and myself to Disneyland Paris so we could have a break from all the stress of a family bereavement. Last time we visited was around 15 years ago when the park was quite new and we had memories of it being pretty magical. Since then we have gone to the California park many times and always enjoyed it, so it was with fairly high expectations that we headed off this weekend.The first thing we noticed was that the  clientele  was vastly different from before. Yes, there were many perfectly nice family groups from France, Germany, UK, Netherlands etc but it seems the park is now attracting a lot of low life types roaming the park , mostly Roma type men in their 30s from Eastern Europe. I would question their purpose in being there as they certainly weren't there for the rides. You'll spot them by their uniform of shiny puffa bomber jackets, jeans and trainers and strong cigarettes (in a non smoking park).We did the usual rides in Fantasyland, Small World was good and probably better than the USA one, Carousel was ok, Snow White, Pinocchio were fine, Peter Pan had a technical problem so we couldn't go on it. Heading off to Adventureland we were really disappointed to see that the Pirates of the Caribbean was closed as that was the main attraction we had wanted to see. No mention of this anywhere before going into the park. However the Haunted Mansion was excellent with great detail.We had Hot Chocolate and Cookies in the morning at the Cable Car Bake Shop for 10 Euros which heated us up in the biting cold. Never underestimate the cold here, it is bitter and really chills you through. Later we had some fries at the Chalet de la Marionette, one of the few cafes where you can buy individual items instead of a full set menu..... this is difficult usually as it's very much burger, nuggets etc which doesn't work well if you have vegetarians in your group. So healthy eating wasn't a feature of the day.....Later on, we realised that Peter Pan was operational again so we joined a long queue. It was bitterly cold by then so I left my daughters waiting for the ride and I headed off for a coffee back to the Cable Car Bake Shop. I was aware that a man was standing right up against me, far too close to me in the queue, So I paid for my drink and sat down at a table, opened my bag to check everything and of course my purse had been stolen with cards and cash all gone. Yes, by the puffa jacketed dodgy Eastern European in the queue. So the evening ended in City Hall, reporting the loss, with a snowball's chance in Hell at getting anything back. Sadly, the magic has gone, along with my purse. Which is why I find myself at CDG airport penniless with my kids having to buy me a sandwich....",Disneyland_Paris

152455219,3,2013-2,United Kingdom,"dont bother taking the early morning entry bonus only one ride was open at 8am   10am although the outdoor funfair style rides were available, like the Carousel and not all the 'lands' are open at that time.

152440267,3,2013-2,United Kingdom,"We got a deal through a national newspaper which meant this was a relatively cheap trip. If I'd paid more I'd have marked it down further. We went in February so the weather's bound to be a factor and it rained when we visited the park (we went to the studios on day 2). Not a problem then except that the park isn't really geared up for rain and cold   there's a shortage of seats inside and nowhere really to have a drink and warm up a bit   at least if there was we couldn't find it. There aren't many indoor attractions at all really so maybe a winter visit was a mistake. There were some good rides though especially Thunder Mountain and we found the FastPass thing very useful   get a FastPass ticket from the machine, have a wander for half an hour, then go straight to the front of the queue. As far as ambience goes it all looked a bit, well, out of place. There's barely an essence of Europe in there which is good if you like your American theme parks but it does suggest a lazy facsimile of a Disney template. It lacks some magic and sparkle   there are merchandise shops everywhere and it just didn't work for me. My kids (6 and 3) liked the Studios better. I think Euro Disney needs to step up a bit as I think we'll be going across the pond next time as it has to be better than Paris...",Disneyland_Paris
152406891,4,2013-2,Jersey,"We went as family holidays. 5 adults and 2 children. There is always something for every one. You need 3 days or more, it's impossible to see most of it in less time and if you have small children they will get tired. So you do need extra time. We all loved it. Shame that a few attractions were close, but they were repairing it. Still there was plenty for us to see and do.Make sure that you wear comfortable clothes and shoes, and take water. Down sides,...every thing is very expensive. If you can, take a backpack with you were you can take a packet lunch, drinks, fruit and some sweets to keep the energy levels up. There are massive queues for the main attractions, so be preparer to wait...a lot! Or get the fast pass : ) The toilets could do with a better cleaning but with so many people in and out maybe its a bit impossible. Any way I defenatly recommend Disney!",Disneyland_Paris

152375092,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,Have been to Disneyland Paris 3 times in the last two years for our family holidays. Twice in February half term and once in October Half term. Travelling with a child who is autistic can be a very stressful experience as the slightest thing can upset him. Decided to be brave and go to Paris and it was FANTASTIC. Our son was entitled to a disabled pass which meant that we could go through the exit rides or collect a time for later. To be honest we found the park much quieter at February half term than October and we chose to travel there on Monday to Thursdays   avoiding the weekend rush. British tourist parks could learn a lot from Disney about how to manage a child with Autism. Generally our experience with theme parks in the UK have been difficult and unwelcoming for our son. Would definitely recommend Disney for a child with Autism. Well done Disney.,Disneyland_Paris

Definalty reccomend fast pass, on the bigger rides you put your park ticket into a machine and it gives you a time slot (usually 1 2 to and hour later) and you basically skip the queues. there were queues for 40 mins on thunder mountain and we walked straight on with our fast pass!! now you can only have 1 fast pass at a time and you can get one i think its around every 2 hours but definatly worth doing on the bigger rides!! Disney characters were around for autographs but people were pushing and shoving to get their kids in a picture! luckily we met Mickey at our hotel so didnt bother waiting!! all in all I loved it, fireworks and show at closing is amazing and the parade at 5pm was well worth a watch but try and get a good spot!!",Disneyland_Paris

On the second day we went to the studios   that closes at 7pm and still went to the disney park to go to some atractions we missed the day before.You can take food from home and beverages   that helps a bit on the costs, specialy the water costs about 2,75 euros   some restaurants have a full menu with beverage and desert for about 18 euros, not that bad..",Disneyland_Paris

So much fun, its the only place where adults can get away with being big kids for the whole time!! There are 2 parks  the disneyland one is the best one we thought. Loads of Disney themed rides for all ages. Movieworld (right next to disneyland) was ok but found it hard to find a seat at lunch time. There are still good rides there though and still really enjoyed it. We bought a 2 day park hopper ticket which was great cos you could do each park twice if you have time! The fireworks are a must see!! Really amazing and also the parade if worth a watch. Rainforest cafe was really nice and so was planet hollywood.

152183374,5,2013-2,Romania,"What to say about Disneyland, well, you arrive in a dream world, the world in wich you grow up in as a child and still do if you have kids yourself. You can be 3 or 60 years, you still see this magic place with the same innocent eyes. Disney make you forget the reality of your life to bring you in the imaginary world like in peter Pan :)First of all, the park is amazingly beautifull, and very clean. the attraction are great what ever they are, for small kids or older as a parents you will still enjoy every single of them. Me and my 4 years old daughter stayed there for 2 days and a half, from the 11th of february till 13th 2013, and i have been surprise compare to what some people said, because we have done all the activities that she was able to do in Disney park, and most of it in Disney studio. the waiting time for queuing was around 15min for each activities, except for buzz lightyear, we wait 40 min and toy soldier parachute drop over 1h. Only 2 activities where close, just because they were not open on those day. We got once technical probleme for peter pan, but the staff were very nice and professional, they gave a fast pass to each of the people queuing to come back when the attraction will be fix, and not having to wait again. and very quick it was fix.All the staff i have met there were very kind, joyfull and friendly, it was a pleasure to have them looking after you, you could have ask them anything, they were ready to help you, and never complain. They had a lot of patience as well cause its a big organisation to manage the attraction and make it run properly.Then, i have been extremely suprise about how clean where the toilette for a place who get so much visitor per day !!! my daughter were not affraid to go there and so do i.You have many place to eat like restaurent or small fast food inside the park or in disney village, wich is outside the main entrance of the park ( so not ar), some people say its expensive, but i found that the quality of the food were amazing and well cooked, warm and just delicious and some of them such as L'auberge de cendrillon was very fancy. I thanks the staff of the place i have eat in ( l'auberge de cendrillon & Silver spur steackhouse) because they change the menu for me because of my food intolerance, they change the sauce and give one without gluten, swap the adult desert with a child desert... for no extra charge, so do not hesitate to ask, and an advice, do not take the ready meal provide for intolerant food people because they taste awfull.I regret, that the Disney charactere are very hard to see, because there is so much people in front of them and everyone is pushing each other to have its picture taken with them, i don't blame those poor actor, who take a lot of time and patience to satisfy everyone but its hard when you have such huge amount of fan in front of you :PI haven't really see the parade, you have to arrive at least 20 min before it start, instead you will have a lot of people in front of you, and your child, even you won't be able to see a bit of it, and its no point then. Te same for the night show, arrive 20 min before it start as there is a lot as well, but this is quiet different because the final show at 8 pm is on the sleeping beauty castle.To get the show ready, the activities in fantasy land finish around 6:30 pm so try to do those one before it close and then keep the others outside fantasiland for later, like that you wont' loose time and won't stand doing nothing whyle waiting for the show.Disneyland park is great for all ages, but mostly for young children, teenagers can still find some exiting activities such as space mountain, star tour,phantom manor or big thunder mountain, but i think, Disney studio i think is more appropriat if you go there and don't have kids, so if you don't stay there for a long time, start with the studio to avoid wasting time and then go to disneyland park to do what left to do for you.Of course there is the shop, some of the article are very good price and quiet cheap i found for Disney but some have very hight price, but similar price as the disney store in your city.I will finish this review with the best part of the day, the night show, it was just unbelivable, the light, the sound, the fire work, the water everything is organise perfectly and make a magnificient show, they made a story around some of the disney cartoon and it work wanderfully,you will have the head full of unforgivable memories and believe me you wont have enought Mega bites in your memory card to take pictures of everything, cause everything worth it, and definitly you won't regret it.Just one more things to add, we had a talk with some of the staff there, and they explain that yes Disneyland is manage by french person, but they can't do nothing without asking the permission to the united state who actually own the Park and have a word to say on there own production, so stop blaming french gouvernment for price getting higher or other.Now, just have fun !!!!",Disneyland_Paris
152161323,4,2013-2,United Kingdom,"We had a good time at the park.Disappointed that lots of rides restaurants were closed. They should have a board at the entrance of the park with opening closing times of each place on it though   we walked all the way to a pizza place (Colonel Hathi's outpost) just after 6 and it had already closed which we didn't understand. Would recommend Pizzeria Bella Notte for good value, tasty food.None of the fast food places, similar to McDonalds, had veggie options though   all burgers or chicken nuggets.Quite long queues but we used the fastpass where we could.

It was cold, but we wrapped up well, it was a bit wet at times too, but it didn't dampen our spirits and it was dry to watch the parades! Not nearly as busy as I've seen it so I would go at this time again, only 10 minutes wait for each ride, many of them we walked straight onto, it was brilliant and we got to go on them over and over (as my kids, niece and sister did with Tower of Terror) Parades were fab, the nighttime show amazing, which was nice as I've never seen that when I've visited previously in October. Disney have the monopoly so it's very expensive, but the wee shop in the station saves some money on snacks to take in, which you are allowed to do. My one huge complaint...I have a 3 yr old, he doesn't drink water or fizzy juice, just diluted squash, it was impossible to buy any in the parks or village, luckily he likes milk which I could get at some restaurants or snack areas, but apart from that had to get cans of still juice from our hotel, Disney should sort that out!",Disneyland_Paris

There seemed to be nowhere to go to get out of the cold unless it was a shop and then in the few eateries that were open there were only a couple of people serving, so MORE queuing. The parade was worth seeing but have to agree with somebody else here who said the staff look miserable. We were hoping to stay for the fireworks by having dinner there, but when we saw the prices in the restaurants decided to head back to our hotel. Although the children enjoyed having 'been to Disneyland', we left feeling it was just a huge money making machine.",Disneyland_Paris

It was so cold we decided to get some food, what an experience queuing in the theatre building near Space Mountain! Lunchtime, shelves empty, one till serving two lines of VERY grumpy people took over an hour, food was lousy once we eventually!! Found a seat. 14 euros for a burger, fries, brownie and coke. Pirates of the Caribbean closed, Space Mountain closed amongst others....

152030147,2,2013-2,United Kingdom,"This was my third visit to Disneyland Park and in those 7 years nothing has changed except the extortionate prices. After visiting the LA park earlier this year, i was exited to be in DIsneyland again abit its European sister. But was disappointed form the moment we arrived to hear that nearly half the attractions where closed and there was nothing new since my last visit 5 years a go.The problems with Disneyland:   Rides: There is not enough. Unlike the LA park which is packed to the rim with attractions, Paris has the same old tired rides. They need dramatically updating, for example Star Wars in on the OLD version still, And there was so little rides for the amount you pay which lead to...  Q times. Because of the lack of rides there was outrageous queue times of over a hour for everything in the park. Even though the park was not busy (i'm talking about a quarter capacity). This is either because of the lack of rides or high capacity rides, and the lack of...  Shows. There was none, Literally 0. Its cold (or hot if your lucky) and you want to sit down for half a hour in a warm place watching a show... tough. There is none. No 4D experiences like its sister parks (the muppets) or live shows (festival of the lion king)... nothing.  Prices. The whole park is just a joke.   4 for a coke,   4 for a coffee,   70 for a hoodie, Who pays these stupid prices. They was laughable at times. That on top of your overpriced ticket and hotel it all adds up wishing you went to Disney World instead.   Staff. Simply there was none. No one at the info board, no one with the character to talk to the kids. Two staff running a ride leading to slow boarding times. It was obvious the whole park was understaffed. GOOD POINTS  The Disney Dreams show. A mix of fireworks, projections and water in front of the amazing castle. What more could you want. The show is truly amazing and gives you shivers every time (and that was not just the snow we had).   The theme. The d  cor is great at DLP and carried out well through the whole site.   The staff. Even though there was a lack of staff, the ones there where present and helpful. So, if you are wanting a cheap Disney trip... think again. I would suggest spending a little more and visit Disney World or DIsneyland Calafornia for a better Disney experience because once you paid the overpriced hotel and drinks food charges it cost just as much.",Disneyland_Paris

A few of the attractions were closed there was very few fast pass queues which we had paid for so it was of no use to us. We found the staff very unhelpful and the whole experience very disorganized. The information board did not have much information on it and the time of the parade did not go up until late afternoon. The food is ok but very over priced bring your own food with you if you can. A coke and a still water is    6.00. Seeing Mickey Mouse was the highlight of the trip   this was very well organized. We will be going back to America for the real Disneyland experience.,Disneyland_Paris
151960738,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"Take advantage of the 'Magic Hours' if you are a hotel guest you get in the park 2 hours befre the general public, only a handful of rides are open but once you get these done with virtually no queue you are then free to do all the other rides you want to. Its just wonderful place and the Disney Dreams show at nightime is just out of this world!!!",Disneyland_Paris
151945441,3,2013-1,United Kingdom,"I took my God daughter aged 11 and she thought the whole weekend was magical, but I was disappointed that quite a few of the rides and attractions were closed for winter maintenance. The weather was also extremely cold, which meant that queuing for rides was not a joyful experience and certain areas were cordoned off for health and safety reasons. The cost of food and drink is also eye wateringly high   so be prepared to part with many Euros while you are over there. Some of the established rides are starting to look a bit tired and in need of a re vamp.  It's a Small World  is beginning to look a bit old fashioned but I expect thousands of 6 and 7 year olds will disagree with me. My God daughter and I queued for a good 20 minutes to meet one of the princesses in the pavilion   she was disappointed as she met Ariel when she could have met Snow White   however there was little option but to queue again to do this!! The professional photos taken with the characters are also very expensive. This is not a trip to be undertaken with a light wallet.",Disneyland_Paris
151924610,2,2013-2,Philippines,"My wife and I just came from Disneyland earlier and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I've been fortunate enough to visit all the Disneylands so my review is relative to the other parks. If I have to compare I would rate the Paris disneyland on the bottom part. It's still disneyland with most of the funfare which only a disney park can bring but in terms of service it was well below par. There were a lot of attractions that were close. Also, almost half of the food stall on the park seemed close and on the main food court there was a long queue on the line since there was only cashier open to accommodate all the guests. They could have at least added an additional staff there. I'm not sure if it's because it was a weekday or if because there was a slight snow during the morning but it still doesn't excuse the other food stalls to be close (I would understand some of the attractions closed if there are snows or rains). If this is a normal practice by the management on weekdays or low volume days then they should at least cut some of the rate their charging. Btw, I've been to other disney parks on weekdays and never had this experience. The other two things that really disappointed me is that they seem to allow or are very lax on smoking in the park. I actually saw a lot of people and even mothers smoking in the park (while on queue, walking on the park, etc). You would expect the Park management would be strict about this given it's a children's park for crying out loud. The other major disappointment is that it felt to me in general (not all though) the staffs didn't show that usual hospitability and approachability that all disney staffs are known for. I asked a staff for some direction and didn't even bother to look at me much more smile. I felt that he's not really in to his work. Even some of the staffs who help on managing the people during the parades were not smiling. I never had these type of encounters from the staffs on other disney parks.If you haven't been to a disney park this should be ok but if you've been to one, you might get disappointed",Disneyland_Paris
151917906,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"It's Disneyland. The second (or third?) best theme park in the world. And trust me, you'll love it here. The employees are friendly and helpful and meeting your favourite characters (while it might seem stupid) is wonderful. I hugged Winnie the Pooh there. I will remember that moment for the rest of my life. The rides are very fun, although the wait times, while stupendous are fairly reasonable. But the prices?! Jeez! I hope your still rich after you pay to get in because the food and merchandise here is insanely expensive! So basically, you'll love your day out. But you'll hate the prices.",Disneyland_Paris
151913622,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"Have been many times, and every time I go it just gets more magical! I remember being a child and being in awe of this amazing place! The parade is brilliant, and the fireworks at night were amazing, I remember my parents making me watch out for Tinkerbell! The rides are brilliant too, with small world still being my favorite! Space mountain, thunder mountain and every other ride are also amazing, and I still get freaked out at the haunted house, at the end of the ride (it still amazes me even though I know how they do it!!) A must go for all children and adults! Will be going back soon!",Disneyland_Paris
151844906,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,Amzing as guessed. Parade is great at 5pm and would highly recommend watching the 20th anniversary fireworks at 7pm they were the highlight of my trip.,Disneyland_Paris
151800102,5,2013-2,United Kingdom,"Here are a few tips that I put together for the park. I've amended them since our last visit to the park.We have been once before in May and then this weekend in February and were surprised that the park was so much busier in February than May and it wasn   t a French holiday. I suspect it is difficult to predict when it is going to be busy as there may be many factors. The weather doesn't appear to make much difference as it was truly shocking for this very busy weekend!Tip for some rides     if your children are young and happy to dress up then the whole family can use Thunder Mountain via the Fastpass line as many times as they want if they are dressed as cowboys (or Jess from Toy Story). The same applies if you dress as Buzz for the Buzz Lightyear ride. Both of these had big queues during the day. The    Baby Switch    system works really well and seems under utilised. You don   t have to have a baby but a child that doesn   t want to go on a ride. As you go through the gates ask the attendant for a baby switch voucher and they give you a piece of paper that allows your partner to then jump to the front of the queue with up to 2 children (depending on the ride e.g. Thunder Mountain allows 3 in a row so you can take three children but Crushers Coaster will only allow 1 with you). This is done well and you don   t feel awkward. There is no time limit on these so every ride we got one of these and then used them during the day if there were any queues or if the fast pass system didn   t apply to a ride. I think it would even be possible to do without a child but I   m not advocating this!!! FASTPASS RIDES     on busy days these run out quickly and they close the fast pass machines down around lunchtime. They also don   t open them at all on some rides e.g. Indiana Jones     we asked them about this and they said that it depends on the foot count through the front door. If it s busy at all then they don   t run it at all on this ride! There also appears to be frequent, and possibly  strategic  closure of the fast pass machines for  technical faults . This never happened before during a quieter weekend.Its important to realise that anyone can use the fastpass machines but not many use it. I couldn't work this out. You slide your ticket down the machine with the magnetic strip facing to the left.Indiana Jones, Temple of Peril  Adventureland height 1.4m   Space Mountain Mission 2  Discoveryland 1.32m   Buzz lightyear Laser blast  Discoveryland    Star tours  Discoveryland 1.02m   Big thunder mountain  Frontierland 1.02m   Peter Pans flight  Fantasyland   Rock and Roll Coaster  Studios Backlot 1.2m   The twilight zone Tower terror  Studios Production Courtyard 1.02m   Flying carpets over Agrobah  Studios Toon studio   Popular rides with no fast pass:   Crush Coaster Studios 1.07m     the only way to do this ride is to get in first thing in the morning. The Studios doors open at 9:30am     head straight to this ride and it will be the shortest queue of the whole day. We never saw the wait time on this ride to be less than 60 minutes.   RC Racer Studios 1.2m   Autopia Discovery land 1.32 self drive   It   s a small world  Fantasy land (long queue but moves quickly)   Pirates of caribean  Adventure land (long queue but moves quickly, beware younger children  get wet and drop)   Other helpful hints   Always very long queue to see Rapunzel near it   s a small world go early   Captain EO  waste of time   Can get a new fastpass after 2 hours from previous one issued   Magic hours 8 10am:Space Mountain Discovery land   Buzz lightyear Discovery land   Peter Pan Fantasy land   Dumbo Fantasy land   Madhatter tea cups Fantasy land   Le Carrousel Fantasy landCharacter Hunting     my kids loved getting autographs and photos. When it is busy you need to plan this well and find out on the information sheets where they are going to be. A fantastic place to get some unusual characters at the weekend is out side the Lilo and Stitch show at 11:30 am and outside the main studio block. Here we found Lilo, Stitch, Ratatouille characters, Buzz characters, Cruella de Ville, princesses etc etc. The next best place is at the end of the procession that happens several times a day. The train stops outside the castle and then all of the characters go to fixed place each day. We worked out where Donald and Daisey went and got photos with both of them within a few minutes.",Disneyland_Paris
151760209,4,2012-9,Ireland,"Disney Parks no matter where they are in the world are every persons dream whether young or old and Disneyland Paris is no exception.It has the rides, the tours, the magic and everything else you should expect from Disney. The only thing it doesn't have is the friendly staff who in general here are rude unfriendly and mostly look like they just don't want to be there. What a shame Disney couldn't take some of its Florida friendliness and sprinkle it over them. But hey as long as you are willing to ignore them you will have a blast.",Disneyland_Paris
151562532,4,2013-2,United States,the night light and fireworks show amazed all regardless of age   magical.  again some great rides in this park   Space Mountain for thrills   Buzz lightyear laser blast great fun   Indiana Jones and Big Thunder Mountain worth the queue,Disneyland_Paris
151425467,4,2012-3,Portugal,"EuroDisney is a great experience... for kids. To be honest, and as a amusement parks fan, despite the reputation of this attraction it wasn't the best I've been. The environment is too depression with kids crying all over the places. The amount of rides closed or under maintenance is insane and the 1 hour queues just turn what should be a great and magical day to a nightmare. This place is for kids aged 0 12, after that you won't enjoy it.I recommend the Isla M  gica de Sevilla or the Warner Bros Park in Madrid if you're looking for something more serious.",Disneyland_Paris
151298690,2,2012-7,United Kingdom,"In comparison with its bigger sister in Florida this parc is very small, the rides are again limited, Space Mountain was our favourite, plus the runaway train ride.The food and drink prices are pretty expensive, the car park now is about    15 for the day which again is another liberty.The queues for the rides can be rather long, avoid school holidays, we went early July but you still can't avoid them. The fast pass ticket services was giving rides times around two hours or so further on, as the rides are limited this hampers your movements, avoid the Railroad as you initially enter the parc, you can walk to the far side quicker.With the recession gripping all and sundry the parades are shorter plus character meets are few and far between.Go to Disney World Florida is my advice, is miles better than Eurodisney.",Disneyland_Paris
151265478,5,2013-1,Ireland,I absolutely loved this park. was there only last week so the longest I queued was 10 mins and that was more for the walk through the attraction. it was great. the 5 o clock parade is a must. we were lucky enough to have relatively good weather. for a couple travelling in low season both parks are definitely doable in one day but why rush?? there is a lot more detail to the parks than the rides and shows so enjoy it. I especially loved the alice in wonderland maze!!,Disneyland_Paris
151249294,4,2013-1,United Kingdom,"we had a great time as the park was quiet at the end of jan so jumped straight on the rides over and over again. although very disappionted with the amount of restaurants closed in the various lands in the park. my son is only 6 so enjoyed the family rides but if you had older children many attractions closed, pirates of the caribbean, casey jr, captain eo, autopia, its a small world, even the train that goes arround the park to the diffent lands was closed.mainly due referbishments,on one of the days the steam boat was operating so managed to get a ride on that. going off peak it maybe worth contacting disney before you book for a up to date list of open attractions.",Disneyland_Paris
151193241,5,2013-1,United States,"Went during a quiet period 27th to 31st Jan, longest we queued for a ride was 15 minutes on BTM, kids loved everything about it, we all thought the parade was fantastic, the Dreams show was amazing and even I actually had a lump in my throat watching it and actually being there.Every member of staff we encountered were friendly and polite and brilliant with the kids, everyone was friendly, we did not witness any pushing, queue jumping, smoker blowing in faces or hostile french people ! When characters were around people were actually pushing our kids forward to have their pictures taken with the characters.The park, people and all other visitors were great, you could see the excitement and enjoyment on everyone else's faces and there were there to enjoy it.The bad reviews for this place must be from really glum people that rub others up the wrong way, I don't know how you could fault the place.All the toilets we visited were clean and we never saw any litter anywhere.Only negatives I have was the boots I had on killed my feet walking in them all day, I had sever neck ache from the kids being sat on my shoulders watching the parade and show and severe arm lock syndrome from my daughter refusing to sit in her chair and making me carry her !",Disneyland_Paris

151046392,4,2012-12,Australia,"My family love Disneyland!!!!!Disneyland Paris is our fourth Disneyland Park that we have visited. We have previously been to Disneyland California, Disney World Florida and Disneyland Hong Kong. Disneyland Paris, whilst not as large as either of the American parks is a very pretty, lovely, enjoyable park, with plenty of Disney magic. We spent three days visiting in early December 12 and whilst it was very, very cold and even snowed; we still enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.The park is quite spread out between rides and we found it very frustrating to walk to a ride, find out it was closed and then go to the next ride, only to find out it also was closed. The cast members themselves didn't seem to know what rides were closed and which rides were open. I understand that when the weather is cold, wet or icy then some rides need to be closed for safety reasons. But it was frustrating to be directed to another ride by a cast member only to find that ride also was closed. We also found it frustrating that rides that were advertised as having fast pass didn't have there machines functioning. Food in the park was tasty, but expensive as you would expect. The rides were excellent as were the character interactions. The firework show at closing was spectacular.Whilst, for my family Disneyland California remains the most magical, Disneyland Paris still has plenty of magic and fun for your family.",Disneyland_Paris
151008817,4,2013-1,Malta,"This is my 2nd visit in this park. You need around two days minimum to visit comfortably the park which is big but not enormous. We visited the park during the week between Christmas and NY and queues were a nightmare! We were aware that this was one of the busiest weeks of the year   but not at this extent! However I have a couple of tips:1) During the day, visit the minor attractions and most importantly the street parades and shows which are nice but also very short. 2) Meeting Mickey and Miney were one of the highlights of our holidays most probably because we had veyr small children with us (less than 5 yrs old) and they enjoyed it so much. This can easily be done during the day too.3) Use fast pass during the day a whenever you can to take a busy ride. To get fast pass, you just insert your park ticket in a machine which issues a fast pass ticket to be used usually within a couple of hours. It really works and you get to avoid a lot of queus. Just be awara that very limited busy amount of rides do have Fast Pass facility and that you get to use Fast Pass once every hour or two.4) If possible stay late at the park and allow most of your rides to be done at this time. We have done several rides after 5 6pm when people start leaving and queues are very very short!!Food is expensive and majorly conmsists of fast food outlets. If you children are getting tired of walking, you can hire strawlers for Eur 12 per day.As I mentioned enjoyable attractions would be meeting Mickey, Toy story ride, Pirates of Carribean boat ride and thunder mountain (which has very long queues so use Fast Pass!). However the highlight of the visit was definitely the closing 20th Anniversary show which was full of laser show accompanied by water play, disney character projections on the water, disney songs accoridng to projections and a lot of fireworks. Simply spectacular and MAGICAL!On the downside finally I was slightly disappointed that many rides were still the same after practically 13 years from my 1st visit. However some new areas (Adventure Land), the Christmas shows and decorations and 20th anniversary were enough to make me forget this.All in all it was a memorable visit for me and my favourite in a magical land!! :)",Disneyland_Paris
150936389,4,2012-10,Sweden,"one of my favorite theme parks. Ever since  was a child, Disneyland has been my numbr one attraction in Paris. Even though it's quite price, I would still recommend this place",Disneyland_Paris
150803167,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,Took the kids in October & had a fantastic break.  Some rides out of action on various days but plenty more to choose from. Even with a young child & teenager easy to please both   not something that is always easy to do!,Disneyland_Paris
150791806,4,2012-8,Germany,"Having been to Paris a number of times, this was the first trip with my 4 year old son. We were in Paris for 3 days only as we were travelling to Singapore. It was a last minute trip, and therefore we planned nothing except that we would like to go to Disneyland and see the Eiffel Tower together as a family. We did not managed to get the shuttle services to take us to Disneyland as it was last minute and therefore we ended up being adventurous and taking the train. I did not enjoy the ride much as the trains were fully packed and the journey was extremely long. The station was very close to the Parks. I must say that like my son this was my first trip to Disneyland, and I was so excited. Outside the park, it is soooo welcoming. People everywhere, and so many things to see. We got coupons for cheaper entrance ticket at our hotel and this meant getting in different and shorter queues at the Park entrance. To our amazement, we got another discount for that coupon at the cashier. The 2 parks are amazing. Layout of the parks were made available with the maps right at the entrance. For a first timer, this helped us to decide where to go. There are so many attractions, sometimes had to wait 30 mins   1 hour in the queue but in the end it was well worth it. My son enjoyed bought parks, and he wants to go back again. We managed to see many Disney characters especially his favourite Lightning Mcqueen.The food and drinks are extremely expensive, and it is recommended that you plan your lunch as the queues can be long at times.It is advisable to spend at least 2 days visiting the 2 parks.Would highly recommend Disneyland Paris to anyone visiting Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
150791254,3,2012-10,Singapore,"Love disneyland, love the TOWER of TERROR!!!!!!

150780831,4,2013-1,Australia,"We avoided the huge rush between Christmas and New Year, but the downside was that many of the key rides were closed. Especially disappointing was Pirates of the Caribbean closing the day before we arrived. I understand that they need to close for maintenance and it probably is best to close many at this quiet time of year, but it was a little sad for us with 4 or so major attractions closed in both parks.Make sure you dress the kids up warmly if you're visiting in winter. My silly Australian teenagers had no idea how cold an entire day spent outside would be, with one insisting that a t shirt and hoodie would be more than adequate. More prepared on day two they had a much better time and we made it right through to the fireworks.Food is your standard overpriced, low quality, theme park affair. But there are reasonable options if to be had within the park or pick up some snacks from the Relay in the train station before going in. There are two Relay stores in the station, one is smaller and more of a newsagent, the other has more food options.Two days was perfect for us and you would fill them up easily at any other time of year with more rides open. As it was, we were happy to have a short day on day one and go later on day two. The French don't seem to be morning people, so unless you're visiting at a peak time, there isn't much point in rushing in too early as things won't be open anyway.",Disneyland_Paris

Only went for one day (9am 10.30pm), which suited us as we had no kids with us. A very long day though. The big thrill rides certainly didn't disappoint. 2 were out of action a couple of times during the day which happened to be the times we had our fast pass for, but we were able to use it later so was great.The fast passes are certainly the way to go though!Oh and the light firework display at the end of the night is just breathtaking and worth waiting around for!",Disneyland_Paris

150538554,4,2013-1,United States,"Our 1st trip to a Disney Park   loved it!! Went on Mon 21st Jan amidst heavy snow, wrapped for the cold not to be outdone. Disappointed to find lots of the rides out due to the snow but understood the health and safety implications. (Some of these had re opened dunring our 4 day stay) As some of the big named rides were already out for maintenance this compounded the disappointment. With a 7yr old it felt we were badly hit with the range of rides that were out and couldn't help feeling that they could spread the maintenance across the types of rides a little better.Went for the full board option   highly recommended as McDonalds type lunch   eat in restaurant cost around 30 euros. As someone who can't eat potatoes I checked the range of lunch restaurants in this programme and it initially looked like a good range   however not all were open due to the low season. Still managed to find some places to eat and would definatley do again. Hakuna Matata very nice!!Found an excellent chap called Alpha in the Customer Services of the parks   City Hall and in the Studios. What a great Disneyland employee, really made the trip for my son more than the charachters themselves. As someone who works in customer services I'd be really proud to have him work for me   Well done Alpha. The Plaza Gardens restaurant (buffet style) lovely, would suggest eating there excellent employee Kevin   and the Sivler Spur ( set menu choice of 3 starters, mains and sweets  I could have had any of them)   only found on our last day for our evening meal but excellent food, happy to substitute my potatoes for rice   will go straight back. Star Tours ride a must do. Great first visit would visit again, especially in the winter as only ever waited 25 mins for a ride and this was  Tunder Mountain .",Disneyland_Paris

As my sister and partner live on opposite side of Paris we drove there in 2 cars. From the moment we arrived we started to enjoy the day. My wife and I had been to Disneyland in L.A. and it was just as good as that.The organisation was, as expected, first class without being gushy. The weather helped though, being 34 degrees! We did as many rides and experiences as we could fit in but the two that we all loved best, including Charlie, were meeting Mickey Mouse and the Grand Parade at the end of the day. We ate at a British type Fish & Chippy sitting outside in the sun.The entrance prices were fair but what made the day better was the 2 free entrance tickets we received unexpectanty from P & O Ferries on the outbound crossing! Truly a great day out which I'm sure Charlie will not forget :)",Disneyland_Paris

150445486,4,2012-9,Australia,"The first time I visited Disneyland, Paris was back when I was 12. I'm now 20 and I visited here September 2012 for 2 days. I had previously booked 2 day 2 parks ticket through my travel agent for 2 people and it came to a total of $500. To me, that is very expensive! Luckily my travel agent was giving out a deal where I got to have $100 off. So that was good. As I live in Sydney, Australia we have no exciting attractions nearby so I thought I should just visit here while I'm about in Paris. The Disneyland Park was great but a couple of the rides weren't operating and I got a little upset about that. But, as I LOVE Peter Pan, i'm pretty happy that ride was still running. The park has Fast Passes available for the popular rides, and I think that's a good idea as some of the lines for the rides just got way out of hand. If you want to get the full Disneyland experience, I suggest you wake up extremely early and be the first one to get there and leave when it closes   which was about 10pm for me at the time. Getting to Disneyland was pretty easy. I stayed in a hotel that was not so much centrally in Paris (Rue des Boulets metro) but I still found my way. I only had to swap 2 trains to get there. Train station is about 5 min walk from entrance of the Park   Handy Dandy.Food is extremely expensive. I ended paying 14 euros for a meal and I still wasn't even full from it! The next day, I just ended up taking some snacks and my own food. Lines for the food were also long. I did buy a lot of gifts to take him in the large Disney store just at the entrance of Disneyland Park (it was expensive as well for toys and little bits n bobs but I had money saved for it cos I knew I would be buying heaps of things) Lockers are available there too. It was about 7euro per bag. I had about 3 so it cost quite a bit but worth it as you don't want to be carrying bags while you're on the rides. My favourite ride other than Peter Pan was the Big Thunder Mountain one. Thrilling and fun :)If you live far from any Disneyland, I recommend going to one even if it's a little costly   like me!Overall, Disneyland is wonderful if you have an inner child. I personally would go again if I ever was in Paris just because it's Disneyland. For all ages!",Disneyland_Paris
150419014,5,2012-11,United Kingdom,"I visited Disney Land Paris as part of a trip to actually sing at Disney. It was a fabulous experience we became cast members for the weekend and what a magical moment when we performed on the stage by the Castle. We were there for 3 days and performed 4 times. We spent the final day exploring I am not a huge roller coaster fan but I did go on Thunder Mountain twice ( better in the dark after a couple of beers!) Also went on Tower of Terror, yes I was terrified but I have done it now so don't have to do it again. The experience was magical the only gripe I have is the fact that there is nothing else there. We traveled by EuroStar so had no means of going anywhere else. The food was very expensive and not always good. The souvenirs were also exorbitant price wise especially when you can get some of the same things all stamped EuroDisney from the Disney shop for a third of the price. The evening fireworks were spectacular and also the parades were worth watching.We were very lucky as our final day was a Monday so the park was quiet and we managed to see lots of characters around the park and have our pictures taken with all our favourites. It is obviously never going to be the same as visiting USA but it was a wonderful experience.",Disneyland_Paris
150418657,2,2013-1,Australia,"I came with very little idea of what to expect, but definitely skeptical. We have a 4 year old and a 2 year old, so this was for them. To be fair, the weather was pretty unpleasant....bitingly cold and at times drizzly. The temperature hovered around 1 or 2 degrees all day and a lot of rides were closed due to ice and snow. The upside of this was that queues were short or nonexistent. The longest we waited was in the Princess Pavilion (20 mins) ....not even knowing that we were queueing for the kids to be photographed with a princess.....and then ushered out the back door! What a monumental disappointment and waste of time that was. Fortunately it gave us a chance to defrost (toes had become numb waiting for Dumbo) and for the kids to share a sandwich for lunch.Captain EO deserves a mention as the most ridiculously absurd time waster of the lot. Don't go there. It's a Small World was a favourite with the kids..and even I found it mildly entertaining..and as there was no queue we did it twice. Phantom Manor and Peter Pan were hmmmm....OK, pas plus. Space Mountain was not my cup of tea, but my husband loved it....fast and furious!The 5pm parade was nice for our 4 year old....2 year old was fast asleep by that time...but not exactly outstanding. What I found most intriguing was how the dancers and characters managed to look so genuinely enthusiastic and cheerful despite having to leap about in the freezing cold singing something about 20 years of Disney magic, knowing they have to do it day in, day out......and are more than likely paid a pittance for it.On the up side, the park was clean and I found the staff we dealt with to be pleasant enough. I certainly wouldn't ever return....unless my children begged and pleaded with me to...when they're quite a bit older.We paid 70    for the 4 of us on a weekday...the 2 year old of course being free...& the 4 year old having free admission as part of the 'buy one adult get one child free' deal. So essentially my husband & I paid 35    each for the day in Disney Village. I believe the usual price for a non dated ticket is 60 or 70    per adult. I just can't believe people actually pay that much money to visit this place! It's mind blowing.",Disneyland_Paris
150387158,5,2013-1,Ireland,"I love Disneyland Paris. We booked transfer using the VEA bus which was great, it goes to all the disney hotels so we arrived stress free. It was great to be here for the 20th anniversary of the park. I travelled here on the 19th January and due to snow, Thunder mounbtain and indiana jones was frozen and closed which was very disappointing as they are my favourite rides. All the rides are brilliant so there was still plenty to do but was  10 degrees FREEZING. A top tip of mine is the cake shops in Main street USA offer at the end of your receipt a free coffee or tes after 3 o clock if you go back with the receipt but its not only in one cake shop its in loads so its great value so make sure you read the bottom of your receipts to see. Best rides are peter pans flight for the cuteness, I loved pirates of the carribbean which was also closed due to renovations, you can check out what rides are closed on the disney website www.disneylandparis.ie under the parks section, i was gutted to see it closed so between the snow basically adventure land was tottally closed but hey we still had a ball and I just love it, where else can you wear a minnie mouse bow on your head when your 32, its just great :)",Disneyland_Paris

The park itself is amazing, as is the facilities etc. However the cast members could not give a dam to be at work, There was no disney charm evident in any of them. It was a cold summers day as paris tends to be but that shouldn't take away the charm that disney is world renowned for. It was raining and a lot of things were closed but the crowd level catered for this i guess. I would recommend it as the 20th Anniversary celebrations are incredible for the most part and i would recommend to stay back to watch disney dreams, it will make a grown man cry. BUT i would go with very little expectation for the cast members to be lively as they will give you nothing.

Some rides were closed   Pirates of the Caribbean is having maintenance and so is Toy Story 2   but the others were open for business despite it being a balmy TWO degrees all day.The bonus of the cold weather was that we virtually had the park to ourselves. The one ride where there was a wait was Space Mountain 2   and we waited about ten minutes if that. The park admission was worth it for this ride alone. It was out of this world!! I went on it twice and I am in my 40s   if you're tired of roller coasters, you're tired of life, right? There were no queues at all for the Teacups, Small World, Thunder Mountain, Haunted Mansion, the carousel   everything we went on we walked straight in.We had lunch in the buffet all you can eat restaurant at the end of main street and the food was great   if a bit expensive   but this is Disneyland and you have to expect that. The merchandise shops were doing a great trade in beanies, ear muffs and sweaters   it was THAT cold.We had the same problems as the other TA reviewers below who couldn't find their bus at the end of the day   some clearer signage at the exit pointing people in the direction of the moving walkways that lead to the bus parking would help.The only downer for us was that our children were at home in Australia and would have loved to be there too.

We did not expect that throughout our visit we would NOT have seen any characters around the parc. It was disgraceful that the management could not have made alternative arrangements for children to meet the characters   for example there are plenty of areas that are dry and they could have wandered around. Or as an alternative they could have put up tents at the meeting points. We also paid for a meal at Cafe Mickey where you are supposed to meet the characters, and yes we did but again only the same 4 were around, so again I would say if they were not in the parc where are the others? and why were they not in the restaurant? I would urge anyone who is looking to visit   DO NOT GO. It is a lot of money to pay when you get NOTHING for it!!!",Disneyland_Paris

I had been told that it was really expensive to eat in the park but if you choose the cheaper places to eat it's not that bad really, no more than alton towers or similar. What really impressed me though was the attention to detail, when the parades were on the dancers didn't just go through their routine they looked at the children, smiled or winked and it made them feel special, then when the characters were out and about the park even though there were loads waiting to have their photo taken they took their time with the kids it wasn't just rushing them through. The disney products in the shops were about the same price as over here so no complaints there, the shuttle buses were very frequent just everything was brilliant.

150184207,1,2013-1,Greece,"than Disneyland Paris. Compared with the Europa Park in Rust  Germany, it is much smaller and has much less adventure rides. We had a two day ticket, but one day is absolutely enough unless you want to spend the day by waiting up to one hour for a one minute ride. And that was in January. Fast lanes were existing, but some of them were closed. Even Mickey and his friends were not seen   might have been too cold for them.There are on every corner shops to buy these nice little fancy dresses, cups, costumes and other plastic trash, more shops than rides.The only good thing is that it is nearby Paris. My advice: If you want to see Mickey and his Friends, go to the next Disney store in your area instead of paying a hell lot of money for Disneyland Paris. In the Europa Park, you are getting much more for your money.",Disneyland_Paris
150172474,4,2012-11,Australia,"I visited the park in late November with my mother as a day trip on our trip around Europe. We pre purchased a 2 park 1 day ticket using a French website  I can't remember which one but I think it was FNAC  and so got our tickets half price. We had a very enjoyable day, arriving just before 10am to find the park already open (I thought it didn't open until 10) and staying until closing. We got the RER from our hotel in Paris which was extremely straightforward. I had been to Disneyland Paris before but this was my mothers first time. Whilst I am extremely fond of rollercoasters and she is not, I found that a day was enough time to take in everything we wanted to see. Lines were short  the longest we waited was about 30 minutes at the Crush Coaster and the tram tour (which everyone made a beeline for in the cold rain  I would suggest giving it a miss  not very exciting, at least for us, though the flames special effect warmed us up for a moment or two) but most other rides we were on within 10 minutes. We managed to explore every section of Disneyland except Discoveryland (no interest with Space Mountain shut for refitting), going on the majority of the rides, as well as explore the Studios and a few of it's attractions too. Whilst food in the park is a tad expensive (show me a theme park where it isn't), we found a good lunch option in Earl of Sandwich in the Disney Village. The Christmas decorations were gorgeous and we managed to catch part of the parade and tree lighting ceremony. The Dreams show at closing was amazing. I have seen a few light shows and fireworks in my time and this was truly better than anything I have ever seen  well worth staying for! The park was clean, and I wasn't plagued by people smoking in line like I had been when visiting in summer. My Mum left impressed and we returned to our hotel laden with bags and happy with our day out. Whilst technically this visit is with family, I classified it as friends as this review may be helpful to those adult groups visiting.",Disneyland_Paris
150172347,5,2013-1,United Kingdom,truly lovely for the children   the disney dreams show was magic and there were rides suitable for everybody.  Take few snacks with you as it is very expensive to eat in the park!,Disneyland_Paris
150170549,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,"Myself, my wife and 2 teenage children spent a couple of days in Disneyland in late December 2012, including New Years Eve. I had purchased the tickets for a 2 day, 2 park trip fromTravel Republic for about   380 for all of us. They send you vouchers in the post and then you change them at the park. Painless! Anyhow, back to the park! Upon going through the main gates we were greeted with a Xmas parade and imitation snow on Main Street, which had thousands of people watching it. All the main Disney characters were on it and lots of performers all dancing about to Disney tunes. Got to say the sound system in both Parks is excellent and at no point does the sound fade away as you walk along. The Disney Castle is very impressive and is obviously the main focal point, as the excellent Disney Dreams Show is projected onto here in the evening. We went on a few rides including an hour long queueing session to get on Space Mountain2. It was worth it though, if you like Roller Coasters in the pitch black, with planets hurtling past you, and then going at high speed down a black hole. Dont go on it if you have a bad neck though, or you'll probably end up in casualty! After this ride we discovered that you could fast track the queueing system by putting your entrance ticket underneath the scanner, near to the rides. You then got a ticket with a time on and 'hey presto' no more queues!! Other rides included 'Pirates of the Caribbean' river ride. That was ok. (Well the wife liked it!) Also an Indiana Jones roller coaster ride. I enjoyed that one, as did the kids. Unfortunately the ride I really wanted to go on, 'Thunder Mountain' kept breaking down so we missed out on that one.Eating in the park is expensive, so we made sandwiches and took other food that we purchased from the enormous shopping mall in Val d'Europe, which is just one stop up the line from Disneyland. We did however eat at a burger place and some sort of Cowboy barn place at tea time The burger place (think it was in the Studios park) was expensive and not very good. The barn place we ate at on New Years Eve, and that was ok and reasonably priced! Certainly in comparison to the burger place we had eaten at previously! I had a bottle of Heineken in there and it cost me about 7 euros. No good for alcoholics this place!I am not very good at describing the parades but suffice to say they are excellent, and you won't be disappointed. As was the New years eve firework display.We also visited the Studios park. This is smaller than the Disneyland Park, but worth a visit. We took the tram tour around the film set, which was worth going on as they re enact an explosion and pour about 215000 litres of water over the tram. We didn't get wet though. Luckily as the weather was cold even though it was sunny. We also saw a stunt show in the Studios park, which takes place in front of a large tiered seated area, like a stand at a football ground. This was very good with car crashes, motorbike stunts, a rider getting set on fire and then they show you how it is all edited together as for a film. This show is well worth a visit.All in all we loved it at Disney, although it is very expensive its worth going to and brings out the big kid in you. If you want to visit Paris as well, it is only a 40 minute journey by train from the station just outside Disneyland. There is also a decent shop at this station selling sandwiches, in case you dont want to make your own for your Disney trip.This visit we stayed at Disneydreams hotel which meant being bussed in and out on a bendy bus. Next time we will stay at a hotel on site so that we can just walk in, and our entrance fee will be included.",Disneyland_Paris

Great free shuttle bus to and from Park, very regular. Sadly due to the weather a lot of the rides were closed but what we did go on was excellent and not too long a wait. Price of Disney merchandise pretty expensive as was the food and again little in the way of vegetarian meals. Staff in the parks were lovely and friendly,as was security when you went in. Taxi's to La Village shopping centre cheap    5.00 return,    2.00 for kids, free for babies. Huge shopping centre which is great some inexpensive shops but the designer shops in the village have crazy prices and the security officers there are horrible (one word of warning don't push a shopping trolley through there, they will treat you like dirt).This was our second time In DLP stayed in the Newport bay 5 years ago, both hotels are lovely but think my favourite is the Cheyenne, very relaxed a lovely place for your family holiday.",Disneyland_Paris

Pirates of the Caribean, Indiana Jones, Space mountain closed down halfway during the day, mark twain boat, lake frozen, big thunder mountain. Basically most of the outside rides. There were not may characters about no outside shows and a lot of restaurants closed. We know Disneyland cannot control the weather but they can control prices and at 79 Euro entry is was a disappointment. Lucky we got the day park hopper and went over to the newer Walt Disney studios where there were two roller coaster rides and the twilight zone ride that were all quite good. The 20 year parade at 5 pm was very nice to watch. Having been to this park before it is not up with the usual stds. Ride times queues underestimated broken seats on rides, food cold etc. I'm trying to be positive but it was a letdown. My advice would be to try and confirm that the snow and ice is cleared away before venturing to the parks or be prepared to wander around in the cold and see the park in a new light.

149584486,4,2012-12,Greece,"We visited the park with my 10 years old son and we had a great time. I had visited Disneyland in Orlando, USA many years ago and I think that I liked it better than Eurodisney. However if you live in Europe, choosing Eurodisney is an one way decision. Children at the age of 10 want to prove that they are not babys, so we visited almost nothing else but the  dangerous  games (Space Mountain, BigThunder Mountain, Indiana Jones etc) again and again and again. They found thw quiet ones  boring and not interesting , so it might be a good idea to take them for a visit at the age between 6 and 9. The 2  extra magic  hours (8 10 a.m.) offered to those who stay at the Parks' hotels is not really much, because not all the lands are open (only Fantasyland and Discoveryland) and then again in those 2 lands not all the attractions are open (only certain games, such as Caroussel, Mad Hatter's Tea Cups, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Orbitron etc, but not the popular Autopia or Pinocchio or Blanche Neige). We met a lot of Disney characters through the park and the children were really excited and very happy. We went there in December (1st week), so it was not crowded and the waiting lines were very short. It was however freezing cold and getting dark was very early (around 5 o'clock). The park closed at 7 p.m., so you have less time than visiting in summer (where the park is open until 11 p.m.) but due to the cold you can anyway not stand to stay any longer. Don't miss the Parade and the Dream Show at closing time. Simply spectacular!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris

We queue'd an hour and 20 mins to go on a little dumbo ride ( the type that costs   1 at the fair) as our little boy really wanted a go. We prob managed to get on 5 rides maximum as it was so busy, we gave up and spent more time watching the amazing parades and looking at the sights as we were getting too cold stood and not moving around.Studios the following day was great, it was a much more relaxed day and we prob enjoyed it more. The parades are still amazing and it is much less crowded. Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Live and Stitch were favourites so we went into both twice.On both days we took drinks and food in with us so that we could at whilst queuing rather than taking time out for lunch.Overall a magical time for any child and we can't wait to take him back.",Disneyland_Paris

We enjoyed the attractions that were the same and also the ones that were somewhat different. Paris Disney has the best Space Mountain. Wow! The parade was great, but it did not have a holiday theme like the one in Florida. The evening Christmas show was very nice, and making it snow on Main Street just put everyone in a festive mood. The closing show with fireworks and animation on the castle was well worth staying until close. Other posts have commented on the food being expensive, but we thought it was average for what you would pay in other theme parks or at the hotels.

However food & drink from stalls vans are very expensive   and prices have increased over last couple of years   despite the recession effecting most countries. Rides thrills experiences are out of this world   and thats what we're all there for !!! Surprisingly there is an equal amount of adults travelling in groups   as there are families with children. So definitely brings out the child in all of us. Restaurants & cafes are reasonably priced (compared to Ireland!)   with food fare to suit everyone. There is even a McDonalds which is in the Village (we never found it for the 1st 2 years of our visits!).There are some buffet restaurants with set menus starting from 20 euro   but you get what you pay for. Too many attractions to recommend   but 1 restaurant which I can DEFINITELY recommend is Rain Forest Cafe. This is so popular you might need to pre book. This has animatronic animals in fake foliage which is all around the restaurant   complete with pretend lightening & thunder ! A tip regarding weather. October is normally mild enough for t shirts shorts etc esp. kids. But also chance of light rain.",Disneyland_Paris
149450051,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,Brilliant trip 4 days of passes each so spent 1 1 2 days in each park . Disneyland park is big and involves a lot of walking beware if you have little ones we went at new year and it was really busy. Make use of the extra 2 hours if you stay in a Disney hotel you get so many rides in before anyone else gets in then can take a break when everyone else is jostling for their fav rides. Use your fast passes as well try and avoid eating between 12 and 2 pm it really does get busy .,Disneyland_Paris
149406506,5,2013-1,United Kingdom,"Been twice in the last year, in June and New Year, with our 4 year old and 18 month old. Absolutely adore it; pure escapism! It's very clean and the attention to detail, especially on the rides, is amazing. I do agree with a previous reviewer about the smoking though   it should definitely be non smoking; I had to ask one man not to drop his ash on my baby during a parade!Yes, of course it's busy but, on the whole, this is well managed, even when everyone is leaving the park after the show. Use the Fast Pass system on certain rides eg Thunder Mountain, Peter Pan and Buzz Lightyear. It's not the most relaxing of holidays but we returned home feeling like we'd been to another world and can't wait to return!",Disneyland_Paris
149388475,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Me and my girlfriend loved Disneyland. We're 21 and 22, just putting that out there. We bought food at a little supermarket thing to take with us but we also ate at in the park. Two roast beef sandwiches, came with a drink and a big bag of lays. Victoria's Kitchen if I remember.Don't let bad reviews put you off, just avoid the peak times. If you don't mind rain, go when it's raining. Do not miss the Cinema show thing either.",Disneyland_Paris
149370688,5,2013-1,United Kingdom,"Liked: the ease of access, the rides, meeting Mickey Mouse, the fireworks at the end of the day.  Disliked: the prices of food and tat in the gift shops, the toilets by the main entrance.",Disneyland_Paris
149354910,3,2013-1,United Kingdom,"My children aged 9, twin boys loved it and I guess that's the reason we went. The Christmas display, decorations and firework extravagant show at the end of the evening were amazing. However, everywhere you go you are surrounded by smokers, doesn't matter where you go in the parks. They even smoke in the queues for rides, horrendous. Most of them are smoking around their their own poor children, however it did spoil the Disney magic.The toilets stink, doesn't matter what time of day either. Many rides were out of action and unfortunately Disney didn't tell me this when I booked. But there was enough to keep the boys occupied, but its definitely not Orlando, doesn't come anywhere near it. But its cheaper and nearer and that's the reason we could drive over and do a few days.",Disneyland_Paris
149351426,5,2013-1,United Kingdom,"Amazing place. Clean and well laid out, there is loads of attractions to walk round not just the rides.The lights fireworks display at closing is unmissable   totally amazing, I couldn't believe how good it was. Try and get nearer the front so see it though, when you're at the back of main street it doesn't look as good.The rides are brilliant and being off peak we got on some rides with no queue. There were some rides closed, but this is well advertised on the website the week before so we planned our days around it.The food is mostly overpriced rubbish. However, in Adventureland Captains Haiti's Pizza Post (or something along those lines) they did lovely lasagne, garlic bread, a drink, and a pudding for 11e which was big enough to share between two. They also had more pasta and salad options than a lot of the places.There are shops everywhere selling stuff for a lot of money and people seem to buy it. The fast food places on site, and the restaurants, all seemed packed every night so people can't think it's that bad for food.If you want a  proper  meal you have to pay about 28e for a buffet but you need to book   it advertises everywhere that you need to book a table if you want to sit down and eat. The people who complain about waiting for a table clearly don't pay any attention!",Disneyland_Paris

149275247,4,2012-7,United States,"You have to get it out of your mind you are visiting Disneyland or Disney World. This is Dislandpark, Paris. Once you get past that, you can certainly enjoy yourself. The park itself is a little small, but had managable crowds and many familier faces. I expected more of an embrace of the many French Disnsy characters (Remy, Quasimodo, The Beast), but no, they did not. The castle is very nice, but small, and has a nice Sleeping Beauty attraction inside. The staff was helpful and the place was generally clean, though one person did slip their child over the rope line so they could go to the bathroom in a bush. That was a bit much and would have never happened back in Florida, but I digress.Overall I am glad we went to park to see how they do it. It is very easy to get to by train (the train lets you off at the main gate, how great is that?) and something different to do while in France.",Disneyland_Paris
149274019,3,2012-12,United Kingdom,too many rides out of action very long  wait for entrance to rides parades were really good.  light show on palace disappointing.light show should have been 9 but didnt get under way till gone ten,Disneyland_Paris

149237878,4,2013-1,Switzerland,"We went with our two kids, aged 7 and 9 years, and they both loved it. We were there early, and so, the queues to buy tickets was not too bad. The rides were great, especially The Pirates of the Caribbeans and the car driving. Queues were everywhere, so one day is definitely not enough. The parade was fantastic, the kids were waving back to Mickey, Mary Poppins etc so happily. The highlight was the fireworks at closing time, definitely not to be missed.",Disneyland_Paris
149182873,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,"Okay so i did have my reservations when i saw how expensive the tickets were but i have to say we had such a blast! We went just at the right time i feel, our son is five and was totally sucked in by the magic and our daughter is nearly 8 so was a little bit more sceptical about what was 'real' or not but she still thouroughly enjoyed. It doesn't say on the park map for Disneyland but if you want to meet a Disney princess in the Princess Pavilion in Fantasyland you have to make a reservation people queue to wait for the queue for reservations to open so I   d recommend that you go there first thing so you   re not disappointed, you can also get three fast pass tickets per day so it's good to plan which rides have this option and to make the most of this facility as rides like Big thunder mountain and Space mountain have queue as long as 75 minutes sometimes longer so fast pass is really handy. So glad we've been there  one day just isn't enough though, we spent three days in the parks and there were still rides we hadn't done!",Disneyland_Paris
149121167,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Pure Disney magic. Everything about this place is perfect and no details are spared when it comes to theme and experince. Thiers something for every one, with rides for the kids and family to enjoy, to thrill rides and parades for the older ones. The night time fireworks and laser show is not to be missed, so make sure to find out if its going to be on when you vist. Well worth every penny.",Disneyland_Paris

149084253,3,2013-1,United Kingdom,"We went to Disneyland Paris in the Christmas season, I really recommended this time to go, unless you don't like standing in queues, because at Christmas it is busier than in the summer :L We went for 1 day from 10am till 10:30 pm, also visiting the second theme park. In Disneyland 3 RIDES where broken, including 2 ROLLERCOASTERS and the MAIN train! Thundermoutain, was closed all day, because apparently the rain damaged the mechanics, although, mechanics where working hard to get it going again. The other ride was the Indiana Jones ride, which did open (evenchally) and we where one of the first people on it :) Anyway, another negative, was the amount of smoking ALL OVER the entire park, we queued 40 minutes (isn't bad at all to be honest) with 4 PEOPLE smoking both behind somewhere and 2 right in front of us. EVEN IN DOORS! I felt so ill after this ride, and it never got better, in every queue, around the park EVERYWHERE people where smoking. Its not fun, walking around a theme park, cramed with tens of thousands of people, and loads of them smoking and pushing!!!!So the possitives, the rides that where open, where just as awesome as ever, so detailed, even the queues! Well, you where stood in them for 2 hours most the time so yeah they should be. But the best thing was the show, at 10:00pm, on the castle was amazing! Also the Christmas feeling really does touch you, and the decorations are awesome! OHHHH yeah, ASLO the Christmas tree lighting, DID'NT WORK? Came on about 10 minutes after the count down, and the whole parks lights kept failing! In loads of rides and queues many lights, wont on, and I know they where meant to be on because I have been before! So yeah it was a good day, but a lot of things that need to be improved.",Disneyland_Paris

This was our 3rd visit to Eurodisney. Once as a couple in 09, then as a very pregnant lady last year and recently with a 9month old! It isn   t a holiday but it is an adventure. You will be very tired by the end and delighted to get home. 5 nights is too long as all the excitement turns into    oh no not another queue   !! But it is special and worth visit at some point for everyone.",Disneyland_Paris
149066239,4,2012-12,United Arab Emirates,"As this was our first visit to Paris, we really had no clue how to go about the place. We did read up online, which helped us plan a little. We stayed at the Disney hotel called Sequoia Lodge , everything was really perfect, the food at the hotel was great in terms of quality and variety. The lunch with the princesses at the park was also something my daughter enjoyed immensely. The Mickey Mouse Cafe was a bit dissappointing in terms of the wait, service and food. Overall, except for the long lines at the parks, this was a really enjoyable experience. France was a little intimidating for non French speakers like us, as English was sparingly spoken, if it all it was, it was fairly broken. We were quite lucky to find a service by the name of Paris Eagle cabs, they pretty much took care of our entire trip. They picked us up at the airport and dropped us off at Euro Disney, which was our first stop. Two days later they picked us up from Disneyland to take us to Paris city. They also provided us a 4 hour tour of the city. Stopping at all the main attractions like Notre Dame , Georges Pompidou centre, Sacr   Coeur, drove us around Champs   lys  es to the Arc de Triomphe and the Place de la Concorde, the Moulin Rouge etc. It was very convenient for us since we have a six year old and so were able to avoid too much walking around that would tire her. They dropped us off at the airport as well. It really made our holiday more relaxing to have a reliable service that was quite timely and friendly.",Disneyland_Paris
149055634,4,2012-12,United Kingdom,If you have kids under 12 they will love it regardless. It is now however looking a bit dated and doesn't seem to introduce any new attractions since any of our previous visits. At Christmas it is still great with the parades being particularly good. Could be improved with a few more rides and a bit of tlc. Make sure you access the park before the general public taking advantage of the golden hours Disney hotel guests benefit from. Toy story was a favourite of our kids. Magical for small children.,Disneyland_Paris
149054860,5,2012-10,Australia,This was my first trip to a Disneyland and at 33 I can say it was the best fun ever!! The end of October was a great time to go as the crowds were thinning out and there was no waiting in lines for rides. The highlight would be getting to meet Mickey back stage. I was exhausted by the end of it and can't wait to visit a Disney park again sometime soon.,Disneyland_Paris
149032079,4,2013-1,United States,"Overall, I think it was a nice Day trip but probably can do i a day. We went for all day with 4 children, 18,16, 12 and 12. It was fun to see the European slant on things since we have been before to Disney in the States. Where else can you see Mickey Mouse and C3PO speaking French? About everything was in English and French and sometimes Italian, German and Spanish. You definitely can get by without speaking French. We were there at New Years time and was less crowded than US parks, especially in the morning. Lots of shops and restaurants opened late and closed early but rides mostly were open until park closed. Not many Teens, mostly families with children. On the bad side, about every 20th person was smoking everywhere even though signs everywhere said it was prohibited. To be fair to the French, it seems those smoking were not speaking French. I was also a little surprised at how the bathrooms smelled like the subway and there were cigarette butts all over. I always thought Disney was OCD about cleanliness. In some rides like Pirates and outside at night it was very dark. I did not feel unsafe but it many places it was so dark I could not see where I was walking. For convenience, take the Metro (RER) as it stops right in front of the park. Avoid the street vendors outside the park though as well as the occasional beggar on the subway (they target those speaking English). Just say Non, Merci. We took RER back to downtown and was not really too crowded and we felt safe.",Disneyland_Paris
149028955,5,2012-3,United Kingdom,"Went as a big group of friends from college in March 2012 for 3 days and have to say it was really good. Seeing all the characters and themes from the world of disney made me (and others) feel like big kids. It is expensive, but it's Paris and its Disney so was sort of expected. Foodwise, a burger meal may cost you around 11 12 euros and something small like a cheese & ham toastie about 7 euros. We brought in some snack items like biscuits and crips and juice cartons just for handiness really. It helped a lot. It's a great place to be though, even for adults I think   the detail into the buildings was great. 1 Main Street and the Princess Castle were brilliant to see and be around. The small shops were really nice. There was a parade around midday with life size versions of disney characters (we saw some of the incredibles characters, buzz light year, woody and jessie, mickey mouse and minnie mouse, goofy and donald duck) was so funny   seeing all these characters we grew up with as children. They have people surrounding them as if they are actual celebrities, so good fun for everyone. There were rides too such as Space Mountain 2, which were added extras. As a group we had tickets which allowed us into the Disneyland Park and also the Studios area, which may be helpful for families and groups. All in all it was brilliant, seeing disney come to life. If you have the chance to go there, I recommend going   especially if you have children :)",Disneyland_Paris

149010228,5,2012-12,Canada,"Took our six and three year old over two days between Christmas and new year. They loved it of course. Highlights were the very expensive but fun princess lunch at the auberge du cendrillon, finding no queues at Pirates of the Caribbean so going round three times, and the buzz lightyear ride. Our tips are to arrive as early as poss as all rides less busy then, and eat lunch early ie twelve, to avoid queues. Also maybe don't plan too much, this is not received wisdom, but it's hard to predict where the crowds will be, so be prepared to just go for which has the least queue and enjoy what you can without spending all day queuing. Eg the cases jones ride in fantasyland is great if I unheralded.",Disneyland_Paris
148975662,4,2012-3,Ireland,"This was my first time to Disneyland as an adult. Myself and three friends went for a day and we got most of the park done in that time frame! Keep in mind we went in March and it was weekday   a Friday so it was fairly quiet in general. The longest we waited in a queue was 45 minutes forBig Thunder Mountain but at least 15 minutes of that time there was no one riding it. There was something wrong with the ride and as we were leaving staff members were handing out fastpass to all those who queued up for the ride. it was closed down for say half an hour to an hour. We went back to it when it reopened.Other attractions we did included; Phantom Manor, it's a small world, Mad Hatters Teacups,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril, Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain: Mission 2, Star Tours.We then went into the Disney Village for food. We ended up inthe Rainforest Cafe. Lovely food and great service!Only downside is it is fairly expensive for a day ticket in.",Disneyland_Paris
148975118,4,2013-1,United Kingdom,Having never been to Disneyland I had no expectations. Despite choosing the craziest time of year to attend (nye) it was easily able to cope with the volumes.The park was extremley well run and by going early in the moring we were able to get on most of the rides with an average of 15 mins wait.Great toilets.Bad food hygeine handling by the crepe sellers. Handling money and preping food!!!The only negative was the Disney merchandise. We bought some of our boys fav toys including a Cars2 transporter. The cars were made of the cheapest plastic and all the spoilers had broken off within 2 days. Extremely dissapointing for our children. If I were Disney I would want to sell the best toys in the park.,Disneyland_Paris
148970025,2,2013-1,Italy,"We stayed at the main Disneyland hotel. Very expensive. The hotel is managed by process, and fails to manage the huge numbers it holds.

148969315,3,2012-12,United Kingdom,"We have visited Disneyland Florida and prepared ourselves for the fact that this resort was going to be on a much smaller scale. I kinda liked this as you could go from park to park easily and pop out to Disney Village for a snack. However, I had expected there to be a similar level of Disney sevice. This was not the case. The parks were dirty and the toilets were smelly and blocked. At one point I thought the toilet was going to overflow when fushed and made a hasty exit. In Florida each toilet had a cleaner permanently on duty constantly cleaning. The park was supposed to be no smoking but no one seemed to care about this and staff didn't enforce. We got fed up walking through walls of other peoples smoke. What really took the biscuit was when we were going into the park and the chap in front of us was putting his ticket through the machine whilst holding his cigarette in the same hand. He was having difficulty and needed assistance from a staff member, and still nothing was said. This led to cigarette butts all over the park along with other rubbish. The staff seemed disinterested when you asked for assistance, and that was if you can find one. The retail staff were not courteous and please and thank you were rare, After the fireworks on New Years Eve the bus terminal was a nightmare. The old ethos of Europeans not knowing how to queue was evident in abundance. When the bus came some idotic woman shouted 'push' and the whole crowd pushed towards the bus. Adults gave little regard to children in the crowd and there were sobbing kids being crushed into the bus. The terminal staff didn't give a damn and cared only about forcing the bus doors closed. My daughter & I were separated from my husband and after our bus left the police had to attend to a kerfuffle which broke out when three Germans went to the front of the crowd. My daughter's arm was caught in the door mechanism as it shut. There is going to be a serious crushing incident here (have they learned nothing from Hillsborough?). Had a decent queing system being in force this could all have been avoided. There were plenty of buses so with a little patience every would have got on eventually. However, a quality lost on the Europeans we encountered. It put a dampner on an otherwise pleasant New Year.",Disneyland_Paris

148921021,4,2012-12,United Kingdom,"The parks are really well laid out and very clean and the Christmas decorations made it even more special. The problem we encountered was the length of queues for very short rides. We were with a 6 year old so she wanted to go on the Dumbo ride and the magic carpets etc. An hour's wait results in a 1 minute ride. Patrons with back problems are advised not to go on certain rides but it was the constant standing that caused our back problems. The staff in the New York Hotel were great, as were those in most of the attractions and restaurants. We only encountered 1 really rude  cast member  on the Tower of Terror ride. Glad we stayed in the New York. It was close enough to walk everywhere, the pool was great and the staff full of advice to ensure our holiday went smoothly. The Disney Dreams show was brilliant and the parades fabulous but make sure you find a place in good time to ensure a good view. We elected to have breakfast at 10 so we could enjoy the extra hours and go back for breakfast. I would go back but not in school holidays   it was too busy.",Disneyland_Paris

Also, the walking distance from the Disny Vilage parking is short by several hundred meters than the distance from the main Park. The price in the Disney Village parking is 2.5.

Yes, you can try to book a fast pass, but we got there at 9.30, queued for an hour for the tickets, got in at 10.30, and the fast passes were already booked until 16.20. We saw a Christmas Parade in the morning, and a Grand Parade in the afternoon, during which no one can move anywhere, because the streets are all blocked off, but there are no other characters wandering around. Our girls managed two rides, both with 90 minute waits, while we wandered aimlessly around in the rain, or sat in a dismal shelter in the freezing cold, waiting for them.

148767776,4,2012-12,United Kingdom,"I see that it has been a while since The Newmarket Group were last reviewed and I can only speak from our own experience when I say how brilliant we found them to be!! We booked a short break to Disneyland Paris in December 2012 for   179 per person and can highly praise the service we received.Upon calling the Company, we were advised there were limited spaces left but I needed to consult with my partner before i could commit to the booking, they were very obliging and understanding about this and reserved a couple of spaces until the end of the day enabling me to check without worrying that the spaces would be gone. The holiday included a convenient return pick up point, return ferry crossing 2 nights accomodation including breakfast at the Hotel Cheyenne and a 1 day 2 park Hopper ticket.Our collection point was in the town where we lived and there was no additional supplement for this. We were collected ahead of the scheduled time as (we were early arriving but so had all of our fellow passengers who joined the coach at various other collection points) and as we arrived at the ferry earlier than scheduled, the driver went out of his way to see if we could go on an earlier ferry which I am pleased to say he was able to do so we were an hour earlier arriving in Paris than expected! Unfortunately we did experience problems with a flat battery when we tried to disembark but, the coach driver knew exactly what to do, kept us all informed and we were on our way again in no time.There were several 'comfort stops' alnog the way but the coach did have a toilet on board and water available. The seats allowed good leg room with more space than you would find on an airplane. Also, there was no suitcase weight allowance but they do request that you only take one suitcase per person.Upon arrival at our Hotel, we were greeted by one of their representatives, she wasn't the friendliest of poeple (like we had experienced with our driver) but she was informative and professional and gave us all of the information we needed. We didn't need to see her again but she did let us know where we could find her should we need to contact her or have any questions during our stay.We would definietly use them again and recommend them to anyone who wanted to visit this amazing place and not pay a fortune in order to do so!!",Disneyland_Paris

148762276,2,2012-9,United States,"It pains me to write this, but if you have been to the orignal Disneyland in Anaheim, skip Disneyland Paris. It looks like Disneyland, smells like Disneyland but isn't what Walt dreamed of. The suits have taken this place over and although the buildings are beautiful, there are little nuances that those like me will notice. Such as no trees in the hub. Attractions such as Pirates with some figures that should be in a dark ride or have been purchased from a broke amusement park! Queues for some attractions look like they are left over from the original 1950s Disneyland and there were no cast members even on a heavy day with guests to guide the guests when there were long lines. People do smoke in Europe much more than in the US but in Disneyland Paris, it made me think it was a health aid and it did not add to my enjoyment of the Park by having people blow smoke on me. Not a little but a lot. But I know this isn't DLPs fault as they have to let everyone enjoy themselves or they won't come.Overall, I will pass next time in Paris on visiting and confine my visits to the original Disneyland.",Disneyland_Paris

148709816,5,2012-2,United Kingdom,I have been to Disney's Magic Kingdom in Florida and prefer Paris' disneyland over Florida's. Paris offers lots of nooks to explore and seems a lot less tired then Florida's Magic Kingdom. The food seems better in this park too. As I went in the off peak season there were no queues to worry about and as staying in a disney hotel got 2 hours extra time in the park. Make use of the fast pass if you are going in peak seasons especially I don't think I needed to even use mine as we had a 10 min wait maximum.,Disneyland_Paris
148603383,3,2013-1,Finland,"We came from Australia, our first visit to Disneyland Paris. We came for New Years Eve and New Years Day. Of course we expected crowds but we assumed given all the marketing and promotion they would be well set up to handle. Our first disappointment was Toyland   technical issues rendered all rides useless. We tried to grab a pizza only to discover pizza shops closed at 10pm. Almost ready to call it a night we thankfully found Pirates of Caribbean. It was excellent. New Years day was a little better with Nemo Crush's Coaster (by far the best ride) and Tower of Terror but the queues (over 1 hour) were very painful. Again technical difficulties with Thunder Mountain were disappointing. The merchandise shops were overwhelming perhaps they should spend less energy selling  stuff  and more on entertaining. Who knows you might even buy more if you felt you have had your money's worth.Having had the benefit of a day in Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen   I'd rather spend the day there than at Disneyland Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
148593731,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,"Best New Year ever! Well it is disney! Amazing fireworks at new year. Great parade. Kids enjoyed the rides, meeting characters. Unfortunately we only had one day at the park and I'd recommend at least two as we in no way got round everything we'd have liked to seen. We stayed outside the park so couldn't comment on the hotels there but they looked spectacular! Only gripe was that new years eve evening was a bit manic with people pushing around to get the best spots for the firework display and having very little regard for the small children they were barging around in the process. Make use of the fast track system as this was really useful. Stops some of the queing for rides and gives you time to go off and do something else before your turn on the ride. Fast track is free and a great idea. All in all fantastic attraction. We were just as excited as the kids to get on everything and see the characters!",Disneyland_Paris
148523222,2,2012-12,United Kingdom,"We went for a 3 night stay at Eurodisney week before Christmas. Have been before and enjoyed a magical experience as per other reviews.However for Christmas time, there was a special Christmas magic missing and we left with a disappointing feeling, given how magical this could have been. For example, we queued up for one and a half hours to see Santa at a far corner of the park, with no entertainment for the kids whilst they were waiting. And the parades were not as good as previous, with the kids disappointed not to have seen more of the Disney characters.So probably won't return next year, will try Lapland instead.",Disneyland_Paris

It seems to me that the park needs to be renovated very quickly.In the past I always enjoyed a visit but now I was disappointed. Altough I visited the park in the passed when there were many people, I was very pleased, but now  yesterday  it was a catastrophy. Several attractions, Space Mountain,Nemo, The Mining Company, Buts lightyear,Star Tours and others were several times out of duty. So it was inpossible to follow are planning and in addition of very long waiting times we lost a hole day of pleasure ( we stayed 3 days).Of course we knew there would be a lot of people, it's seems that they were not capable to handle such a mass.Sorry Disney Paris, shame on you.Positive : the beatifull laser show.",Disneyland_Paris

148451099,5,2012-12,Ireland,"Just back from spending a four day stay at the DIsneyland Resort Paris over Christmas. Its our second time to spend Christmas in Disneyland Paris and again we really enjoyed our stay. It kind of has something for all age groups and even manages to satisfy the teenagers in the family. Who can resist all those cuddley characters! But a word of warning if you are expecting to sit down to the traditional Irish British fare of turkey and mince pies youll be disappointed   none to be seen! However, it didn't dampen our spirits we have a great time, took it at our own pace, the crowds were really out on St Stephens day but the athmosphere was great! Well worth it!",Disneyland_Paris
148431315,3,2012-12,United Kingdom,"A candid review of DLP for anyone thinking of going, at risk of sounding a snob, my husband and I hated it from the minute we arrived although we had anticipated a large dose of cheese. We could see our kids loved it so we tried t embrace it, however, I wish I had been warned just how contrived it all is. So, plus points. The rides (once you get on them as average queue time was about 40minutes) were great fun, well thought out and something for everyone. The parades are very exciting and schmaltzy but good cheese. Meeting the characters is great, unless u arrive slightly toolate, queue for 10 mins and then get told, sorry, too late! Negatives, the food everywhere is dire. Even planet holywood, cafe mickey etc, just poor quality, rubbish selection and service generally with no smile or manners. The queues are jus so boring! We queue for an hour for big thunder mountain and then the maintenance crew shut it and herded us all out! So my advice for anyone likes, who prefers national trust, variety of food, and doesn't want to just wander round endless Disney shops for five days, just go for two days. Poor advice by my travel agent as we should have gone into paris for a couple of days. Not meaning to sound bah humbug but I think disney marketing people think we are all stupid.",Disneyland_Paris
148429319,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We have been dozens of times (lived in Paris when the kids were toddlers & had an annual pass). We went in 2012 on the way home as a 'memory' of the old days. Here's our tips: Prepare for the weather (suncream if you are lucky) It can be quite cold or wet Arrive early as queues are shortest before midday Look for ticket deals (hotels, train tickets usually have offers). Use fastpass to plan getting on the big rides (one valid fastpass pp at a time) There is lots of space, our best 'quiet' spaces are; videopolis, secret passageways between legends of the wild west & main street, Quiet rides: It's a small world, Pirates & Rock & Rollercoaster We have had 'rude' behaviour but mostly staff are friendly and fun. Take a packed lunch & eat as you go. Take water bottles and fill up at the many water fountains Enjoy all the shows parades, especially to give the legs a break. Or plan busy rides during big parades to avoid the crowds If you arrive late by car, drive around the exit lane to the front where there are always spaces. Car is the easiest way to travel and in the rush leaving is fine (eg New Years Eve). Lots of good accommodation off site. We have used numerous hotels & houses and used the bus or car. Train is easy too but with a family car seems to keep winning Watch out for French holidays and bank holidays as most visitors are local You need to plan 2 3 days to see it all. The main park 2 days, Studios 1 day. Studios has less places to eat.",Disneyland_Paris
148427394,3,2012-12,Belgium,"As a very frequent visitor (we must have been visiting Disneyland over 100 times by now since we have Dream passes for the past 10 12 years) we still enjoy visiting the park because of the general athmosphere. When you see the park for the first time, you will be impressed from many surprizing elements. Yet, we can only say that the exceptional nature of Disneyland is gradually disappearing. This is likely a result of the need for cost savings, made by Disney management. I the past there were great shows like  The Lion King ,  Mulan ,  Beauty and the Beast ,  Pocahontas ,...Apart from  Tarzan  which is a show that was still running last summer, all inside  shows  have been eliminated. Yet, this was probably one of the elements that could attract an audience of all ages. While today the rmaining attractions focus on small kids and on youngsters that like to sit in  fast  attractions. Also, some attractions inside (Peter Pan, Snowwhite, Pirates of the Carribean,...) are pretty dark and makes you miss the fine details which you could see in the first years of the park. Maybe this is done to limit the frightening effect for small children, but again this makes the park more and more and attraction for smaller children rather than for adults.Petty, but we still hope the great shows will come back one day.",Disneyland_Paris

OK, so we arrived by train from central Paris bang on 10am   about a 50 minute journey   and quickly passed through the security scanning. We'd bought our tickets online in advance so we didn't have to queue for them and we made our way to entrance where we were quickly scanned into the park.The first impression was that this was going to be everything that was promised with a large sign illuminated with fairy lights leaving you in no doubt where you were and celebrating 20 years of Disneyland Paris. You went under the sign and the view opened up to Main Street USA with Sleeping Beauty's Castle at the end, possibly one of the iconic images of the Disneyland Parks which even on an overcast December day didn't fail to impress and make me to revert to a giddy child when mixed with the jingly jangly festive music...Unfortunately this wasn't going to last. We decided to go on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride first so made our way across the park only to be told that it wasn't currently operating due to a 'technical problem' although it may be opened later. Disappointed we headed over to the other big ride in that area, the Indiana Jones Temple of Peril only to find the familiar park staff blocking the way and when questioned we were again informed that the attraction was closed due to 'technical problems', when questioned whether any rides were actually operating I received a shrug in response. The magic of Disney was quickly fading.Every ride had queues and, speaking to my partner, a lot of them seemed to be pretty poor relations to their UK cousins. To be honest, my own impression was that once you got past the initial glitter it looked a bit tired with fading paint and old fashioned malfunctioning rides (both the Haunted House and Buzz Lightyear rides stopped for some reason whilst we were on them)The fastpass system was OK but you could only get one ticket at a time and couldn't get another until the previous one had expired. The ability to get on rides in minutes was in reality about a 20 minute wait rather than the 60   90 minutes it would have been otherwise but you often had a hour plus between getting the pass and your time slot opening.I expected people in Disney costumes to be everywhere but in reality we only saw Goofy and apart from on the rides there wasn't really anyone 'in character'.My disappointment as a first (and probably last) time visitor for Disney was compounded by the fact that my partners expectations as a previous visitor were so high.

148274497,3,2012-12,United Kingdom,Queues are insane here many rides having waiting times of over an hour and fast pass was never working throughout our stay so our fast pass tickets were pointless.

148257596,3,2012-9,Australia,"I was expecting an absolute wow factor from Disney. Disney usually pay such attention to detail, that everything is almost perfect; our experience fell far short of wow.In previous years, we have visited the Disney Theme parks in Orlando, and the Paris theme park is no where near on the same scale, or experience in terms of quality.We visited in September 2012 for our son's 2nd birthday, and stayed at the Disneyland Hotel (please see other review for hotel). This review is for the theme park itself.The rides and experiences are ok, but there are a few things you need to consider prior to booking a trip to Paris over the Orlando theme parks.  Smoking is allowed within the park itself, and as someone from the UK where there is usually less smoking, we often found ourselves passing people smoking all around the park, rather than having designated smoking areas. Personally, I have nothing against people who smoke, but, I not agree with smoking around young children; I would have thought Disney would have a no smoking policy, with designated smoking areas, especially as the park is aimed at younger children.  The queuing system is not as efficient as the other parks in Orlando, therefore waiting for rides can take longer than expected. One example was the train which goes around the whole park had been leaving with seats empty. We then waiting a further 15 minutes for the next train; this can be frustrating when you see seats empty, and more of a challenge keeping a 2 year old occupied for 15 minutes in a line waiting. We also often saw other rides leaving with seats empty.  Fast Ticket system   there are only 3 rides in the park for little ones with a fast past ticket system, so get used to waiting in long queues with little ones. Even if using the fast ticket, there is still a long queue. We waited 15 minutes just to get a fast pass ticket from the machine. When we returned to the Buzz Light Year ride, we entered the 'fast pass' queue, and then waited another 30 minutes to get onto the ride.  On the restaurants over this busy weekend, 2 out of the 3 casual dining restaurants had been closed (Buzz LightYear and Aladdin closed), which left one casual dining restaurant opened, which was so busy it meant we lived on 'fast food' most of the weekend. Fast Food is expensive, we paid 3 euros for a bottle of Coke.  The Theme Park map is in English, but there is still some French on the map. We spoke basic French and was ok, but we had been talking to others from the UK who had asked us to translate.Overall, it was a good experience for our small family, but not a 'great' experience you expect from Disney. Especially considering how expensive the experience is.The rides are fun (if they are open), walking around the park is fun, but be expected to queue, book the 'casual dining' restaurants in advance, and understand that smoking in public around children is part of the culture.If I could do this again, having visited both Orlando and Paris Disney parks, I would have preferred to wait until next summer, save up a little more, and go to Orlando from the UK rather than Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

148130491,4,2012-12,United Kingdom,"We spent Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day in the park. We were treated to a spectacular light firework display on Christmas eve, and very much enjoyed the parades. We found toilets were easy to access, and food drink always to hand (at a price, though we had been warned so expected nothing less). We did find the queues a little hard going to go on the rides with our 3 year old, but again you cant go expecting anything less. We were a little disappointed some of the rides we were looking forward to going on out of use, but it was just one of those things. Overall, the experience was magical. We enjoyed every minute of it. The only note for parents   don't forget your Calpol. Our son was taken poorly, but was advised I would have to get the train out of the resort to get to a chemist. This surprised me with it being a family resort that one wasn't onsite, but it was my own fault for not being prepared.Overall, I would reccommend as it really did take me back to being a child looking at everything, and seeing the castle.

147884275,3,2012-12,Australia,"We went to this park as a family of four, two teenagers and two adults. The rides were good, lots of scary roller coasters which we enjoyed. The rides are not the same as in the U.S (I'm not American so am not biased towards the U.S parks ) so that is worth noting if you are hoping to replicate your experience. The names are the same, the ride isn't. As per any Disney visit get there early and get on the rides you want first. If you have any dietary requirements bring your own food. The food here runs mainly along the chips and burgers theme. Lots of good merchandise but many things very overpricedThe big minus on this park for me: they don't police the No Smoking policy and I find it unbelievble that this is allowed where so many young children are having fun. It also spoils the amenity for those who don't smoke. There are smoking areas and that's where smokers should be made to go. I also experienced a very rude staff member who actually rolled their eyes at a customer while she was getting correct change for her meal.The customer was French. Then he spoke rudely to me while I tried in French to order my meal ( I can speak the language although my accent may not be perfect) However, the other staff were friendlier ( Phillippe in the gift shop was excellent ) but for my money you can't beat the U.S staff. They make you feel as if you are valued and wanted.

Yes you could, maybe, find little faults but overall the experience was great. The staff in the park and the Santa Fe Hotel could not have been more friendly and went out of their way to oblige. We thought the evening meal price in the hotel seemed expensive, until we ate there. For 23 euros for adults and 11 euros for children you could have a starter, a main course, a dessert and a cheese course, at the very least. There was no restriction on the amount of food and tea, coffee or fruit juices you could help yourself to if you wanted. The choices were very varied and very enjoyable. Wine prices, for a restaurant, were very reasonable, 8 euros for a 50 cl. carafe.The Disney parades were, as always, excellent. You can't help feeling happy as they pass by and pay attention to the children.

While we were only able to fit in Disneyland in one day and had to miss Walt Disney Studios, we had a wonderful day. The parks were decorated for Halloween, so it was really fun to walk down Main Street USA festively outfitted with pumpkins and ghosts. Disneyland Park is laid out very similarly to its sister parks in Florida and California, so it was easy to manage the park without speaking French. I especially loved seeing the variances in rides such as It   s a Small World, Phantom Manor, and Pirates of the Caribbean. The Disney Dreams show at night should not be missed. It reminded me quite a bit of the World of Color show at Disney   s California Adventure, but it   s set against the Sleeping Beauty Castle. It was spectacular!

Here are some ways to help you experience a more enjoyable visit than we did (it was very good, but we have learnt some lessons).There were two lines to enter the park, one for people with bags and one for those without. Guess which one moved faster? (The second, if case it is not obvious.)Although it is smart to carry water bottles, we saw drinking fountains around the park so if you do not wish to be saddled with bottles, you won't die of thirst.Plan your visit. If you are going as a group of adults, print multiple copies of each person's entrance ticket and make sure everyone has everyone else's tickets. Take a map of the park, decide which rides you wish to enjoy, and once you are in, split ways. Each person will then queue for fast pass tickets at a ride, so when you all meet up again, you have just saved yourselves a lot of queuing time.Don't expect the queues to be shorter in winter. They are still long, plus you are waiting around in the cold. Except the queues for ice cream. Those lines are empty.Enjoy, and don't forget to high five Mickey Mouse if you see him!",Disneyland_Paris
147768662,5,2012-12,Australia,"We went the week leading up to Xmas and were unsure what the crowds would be like. Most French schools were not yet on Holidays and we were incredibly lucky that there really weren't that many people there. A few school groups of teenagers but otherwise young families, meaning we had the roller coasters to ourselves. We decided to get the 2 park pass because of this. Lucky to have been there several times before we raced to organise our fast passes but there were no lines, and most rides were a 5 min waiting time. How delighted we're we. The place was so beautifully decorated for Xmas, it just looked magical. The absolute musts are Space Mountain, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Carribean, RocknRollercoaster, Terror Towers andNemo. Make sure you pay a visit to the dragon under the Castle and I always leave Fantasyland for last when the lights go on cos thats when it looks so lovely. The new Disney Dreams show is the best I have seen so far. You want to be standing back from the castle as it is a Panoramic view and the more of the castle you can see the better it is. It was spectacular, absolutely beautiful... Tears in your eyes wonderful for young and old. The whole day was amazing. We were exhausted and exhilarated and are just delighted that the Disney experience can just keep getting better.",Disneyland_Paris
147764741,2,2012-12,Malaysia,"One of our reason to stay at Marriots Village when we visit Paris is proximity to Disneyland. However, we were quite dissapointed with our experience. We have been to Disney California and our expectation are high.We bought 2 day passes to enter both parks. The escalator from the parking lot does not work both days going and coming out. It was a long walk until you really get to enjoy all the rides. The roof covering the walkway from the carpark is leaking badly and it was raining during our visit with water driping like a drain from the ceiling.Some of the rides are closed for maintenace. The staffs are not friendly or informative as a Disney employee should be. This is a land of dreams and imagination and we expect all employees to act their part throughout our rides. They are not enthusiastic or proud of the character the are asuming be it as a ride attendant or salesmen at the many souvenier shops. Maybe we are spoilt by the atmosphere we feel in Disney Anaheim.......the costumes, the greetings and the enthusiasm.The ride to visit the studios to see how films are made is a real ripoff. The TV monitor are not working properly and some transmission were cutoff that makes the narration and the sight we are seeing off tangient. the show are lame and not worth the time spent waiting in the cold for the ride.The furnishings in the theatres are old and threadbare. However we did enjoy the shows put on even though we can see the cobwebs on the ceiling.We felt cheated for the cost of Euros 770 we paid for 2 days 2 park for the 6 in the family. We will not recommend you to visit this park. If you want a real Disney experience, go to Anaheim California, not this half bake park. Its a shame to the Disney trademark",Disneyland_Paris

Disappointing that on the day we visited two of our fav rides were closed but perhaps it was the cool weather. Still, the crowds were there and the people still came, because it is after all, the happiest place on earth! Have to say though, not all that clean which was disappointing as Disney is usually so clean and pristine.",Disneyland_Paris
147658215,5,2012-11,United Kingdom,"We had a four day stay, at the Hotel Cheyenne, for my son's seventh birthday and my wife's 40th. The trip was well planned and in hindsight combined the best and worst of the parks. On the Thursday and Friday we went on all the rides we wanted with minimum queues (15 minutes tops). Space Mountain was our favourite roller coaster closely followed by Pirates of the Caribbean. We didn't need to use fastpass at all on these days. The Christmas themes and the nighttime Dreams show was amazing.However at the weekend we only got on the rides during the extra magic hour (Space Mountain and Buzzlightyear) and then a fastpass for Thundermountain. The queues were horrific, over 80 minutes for most rides in a freezing environment. We took the train around the park and were lucky enough to be able to pop back to our hotel to thaw out. I would have been devastated if we had gone for the weekend only but the Thursday Friday compensated.",Disneyland_Paris

147610149,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,the park is amazing and split up well. The only down side were that some of the rides had waiting times of over 60 mins which was not ideal.  The kids loved this park as there was lots of rides for them to go on,Disneyland_Paris

147479194,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,"We (2 adults & 4 Children) went to Disneyland Paris in Oct 2012 at half term school holidays! So we were expecting it to be busy! It was extremely busy, there were always very long queues just to get a fast pass. We have only previously been to Disneyworld, Florida and Paris was very much the same but on a smaller scale. Some rides, like Thunder Mountain, were better than Florida. The park is easy to get round, but like any Disney park, planning what rides you want to go on, fast passes etc is essential!!! The only negatives were the fact that even though there were designated Smoking areas around the site (Always empty!) and the fact that there are signs up, people smoke EVERYWHERE,even in the queues!!! and no Disney staff tell them to put them out!! Also, many visitors do not understand the concept of queues and think they can walk straight to the front and still smoking!!!!!Overall a nice place, but very busy at peak times.",Disneyland_Paris
147460367,5,2012-11,United Kingdom,"Everything that you would expect from the Disney Parks. I have been 4 times so far and it never loses that magical spark.

It's like stepping into a fairy tale. Which is what you do when you visit a Disney theme park. I've had the pleasure of visiting Disneyland Paris and California.

No woody, jessy or Rapunzel and every person we spoke to were trying to find a certian character and felt the same. I was expecting to be bumping into characters on every corner. When it was raining there were no characters at all walking around. Everything else was amazing especially the parades and dreams show. I would recommend it to any one but dont expect to see all the Disney stars, its the same ones over again.",Disneyland_Paris

147020006,4,2012-12,United Kingdom,"We had a great time at the park though fast passes helped a lot. The boys aged 4 and 6 loved pretty much all of it, but especially Discoveryland. There were quite a few rides closed either longer term or due to technical faults on the day. By staying 3 days we managed to do everything we wanted except the teacups ride. The Christmas decorations across the park and fake foam snow on Main Street were the perfect start to the Christmas season.",Disneyland_Paris
146995430,5,2012-11,Belgium,"Once again, we spent a full day at Disneyland. It is pleasing that Paris has two amazing attractions   Disneyland and Eiffel Tower. Both provide an excellent experience.As in past, the visit was completely fun and memorable. The park provides many rides (some new ones like Toy Story and Cars related...).Even though it was a weekday, there were long queses as usual (wherein one has to wait for 30 45 minutes per ride).",Disneyland_Paris
146959958,5,2012-11,Australia,Amazing day at disney. Loved all the rides and how it was spread out in different themed areas. The parades were gret to watch and loved the christmas theme with carols playing all day. There was really small bubbles when the parade was on that looked like snow with was a special touch. We were there for the 20th anniversary so to top off a great day the display on the castle and the fireworks were amazing.,Disneyland_Paris
146943215,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,"This was probably about my 15th time to Disneyland Paris, not been to America so nothing to compare it to, but I love it here! Lots of different rides for kids and adults. Favourites are Its a Small World and of course Space Mountain. There is definitely something for everybody. It can get very busy but to be expected at any theme park!",Disneyland_Paris
146933365,4,2012-12,United Kingdom,"The Park and Studio offer good attractions for all ages. We were disappointed that some were closed when we went there, in particular Space Mountain which was one of our 'must do' rides.My main criticism is that the food, drink and gifts are all overpriced, both in the parks and Disney Village. If you have a family to feed, the price soon mounts up. The cheapest burger cost 7 euros 30 and drinks are around 5 euros. If you want a dinner at night you are looking at 20 euros upwards for a main dish. Of course drinks and desserts push up the price even higher.The price of gifts and toys for the children are also extortionate. We wanted a small Disney photo frame to replace one that got broken, but 30 euros was out of our price range. We went to Disney 10 years ago and the rides and attractions are basically unchanged. The parades and evening display on the castle are always excellent, but you need to queue early to find a good vantage point.My advice would be to wrap up really warmly   lots of layers  because it is freezing in winter.",Disneyland_Paris
146865308,5,2012-12,United Kingdom,"Before I went to Disneyland Paris I looked at the reviews on tripadvisor was a little bit concerned when I was seeing reviews along the lines of '...needs a revamp...' and '...not all it's made out to be...' thinking is it all going to be a bit of a let down?Well the answer was NO.I thought I'd write this review so that other families that were looking at reviews of Disneyland Paris would not be concerned by the negative or not so good comments that have been left.We stayed in the Sante Fe Hotel which is a short 2 minute bus ride to the park. The hotel itself is nothing special, but it's very warm and has the facilities that you need. We had a problem with changing the code on the safe and unfortunately I locked it which meant a trip to reception to ask for help. I could tell the lady at reception was laughing at me for being such a muppet even though she was speaking french but nonetheless we had someone at the room by the time I got back and was very helpful in sorting the safe out and 5 minutes later I had the safe sorted. After that we had some snacks and got an early night ready for the next day at the park.The next morning (Monday) we went across to La Cantina where a continental buffet breakfast is served. Theres nothing hot available, which wouldn't have gone a miss in such cold weather, but theres plenty of cereal, toast, criossants, cheeses, ham, juice, tea, coffee etc fill you up to start the day. We had an early breakfast at 7 7.30 but you can change it for a different time however it's already pretty busy at that early hour and going at that time meant we was in the park for just after 8 to make full use of our extra magic hours.Disneyland Park itself is pretty special even first thing on a dark and cold morning. We went up to the It's a Small World ride first off and it was a nice ice breaker to the magic. Only part of the park is open before 10am so we had to wait for Frontierland and Adventure Land to open but you can still burn a couple of hours before these open in the other parts of the park and it's always nice to look around the gift shops too. Once the other parts of the park opened it started to fill up a bit. But we still queued for no more than 20 minutes for Big Thunder Mountain. We walked straight onto the Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril ride   which was one of our favourites, the Pirates of the Carribean ride is not really that thrilling to be honest but it's still quite fun looking at the pirates and the scenes and theres a couple of splashes which adds to it. We had food in Discoveryland then while watching a brass band with Mickey Mouse as the conductor. Space Mountain was closed while we were there but it didn't spoil the day at all as theres so many other things to do.In the afternoon we went over to the Walt Disney Studios Park which is all about the Disney movies. We went on Crush's Coaster which is one of the best rides in Disney. We saw Chip and Dale over there too wandering about in santa hats which only adds to the atmosphere. We wanted to see the Lilo and Stitch show but we just missed the english version so we left that until the next day. After wandering about we went to the Disney Village to see what it was all about. Theres a lot of shops including a McDonalds and a Starbucks and also a Planet Hollywood, which gave us a good 45 minutes before heading back to Disneyland Park to see the lighting of the Christmas tree and the Disney Dreams show.If you go at Christmas and want to see the lighting of the tree its best to get there early so you can get a good spot to see the Disney Characters. Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and Donald Duck arrive on a giant sleigh and have a good dance to some music before picking a child from the crowd (pre chosen we think) to light the tree with the magic wand. They give the child a hat and a gown to wear and then bit by bit the tree lights up until it reaches the top and the star is lit and snow starts to fall over you. It was possibly one of the most beautifully festive things we have ever seen. At this point the place is packed with people so you have to be careful when manouvering towards the castle but make your way over straight away so you can see the Disney Dreams show, which marks the 20th anninversary of Disneyland Paris.The Disney Dreams show is something else. The castle is lit up prior to a story is projected onto the castle itself where Peter Pan's shadow knocked the magic out of the star on top of the castle. The story goes through a catalogue of Disney's greatest movies and characters with Peter Pan's shadow flying about during which fireworks are going off and giant flames and are so big we could actually feel the heat where we were standing. The story is also projected onto the spray from the fountains which is a really clever touch. Trying to describe the show fully however is near impossible, you really have to see it for yourself but without a doubt it really is these parts of the day that make Disneyland what exactly what it is   magical.The park closes after the Disney Dreams show so we headed back for the hotel completely shattered but looking forward to the next day.We were awake at 6am and in for breakfast at 7am again and headed over the Disneyland Park to make use of our magic hours for the day and went straight to the Buzz Lightyear ride. This ride is great fun shooting targets with lazer guns and trying to build up points. It's not too fast and the ride itself is contantly moving so we only queued for 5 minutes. I took it a bit too seriously though and racked up over 100,000 points, much to the amusment of my girlfriend and her son. Whilst we were in Discoveryland we went to see Captain EO   to be honest I didn't see the point in it, it was a bit boring but we are big Michael Jackson fans so it wasn't all that bad. A small documentary is played before you step into the theatre explaining what Captain EO is all about and apparently it caused a big fuss in 1986 when it opened in DisneyWorld in the USA. If it was 1986 now, then yes, I'd probably be blown away by Captain EO, but it's 2012 now so it wasn't that impressive. After that we headed over to Walt Disney Studios Park to see Motuers Action Stunt Show.WOW. We loved this show. I initially thought it was going to just be a few cars doing some stunts and then we all move on, especially when a motorbiker comes out and starts doing wheelies and endo's i thought it was going to be a bit weak. But it wasn't. After a bit of cool car driving a presenter comes out and starts explaining the works of doing stunts on a film set. Another American guy comes out, followed by another chap, and then a whole crew is eventually walking about, setting up scenes and going through the process of filming a stunt. I won't spoil it for you by going into any details but theres fire, glass, guns, glass and awesome stunts all going off and the show is a must if you visit Disney   my girlfriend's 7 year old absolutely loved it.We went and caught the Lilo and Stitch interactive show in english then, which is cleverly done but doesn't last very long. Stitch is very funny however and the kids really enjoyed it so again, worth giving it a go. Myself and my friends fiance were the only two of our group that wanted to go on the Hollywood Tower of Terror so we then went to queue up, which took about 20 minutes. This is a great ride. I'd heard a lot about it through the grapevine so I thought I knew what to expect, but when we were waiting in the 'Maintence Room' my heart was racing. It's a really clever ride if it wasn't for the queue getting bigger I would have gone on it straight away again  amazing.We then watched the Parade in the Studios Park and a few of the characters from the movies drive past in cars, such as Aladdin and Jasmine, Ariel from the Little Mermaid, Cruella de Ville to name a few and then Mickey and Minnie Mouse in the last car. Nice little parade to keep the magic alive. We then had a bit to eat and went back over to Disneyland Park.Back in Disneyland Park we went to the Phantom Manor. I was really looking forward to this in particular as I love the spooky rides however the intro was in French and it wasn't really that spooky, however the sets were really well done and pretty gruesome so it was good from that perspective. We headed back over to catch the main parade then and got there nice and early to get a front row spot. We watched the parade and had a hot chocolate to keep us warm. It only lasts about 10 minutes but it's great to watch and it's lovely to see everyone's faces light up and it was a nice way to bring the final day to a near close. As it was our last night we decided to eat in one of the restaurants on Main Street USA   it was an all you can eat buffet which cost 26 Euros each for the adults and 13 Euros for a child but it was worth the money and the food was delicious, so we ended up getting more than our money's worth. We ended u doing a last bit of shopping for gifts before heading back to the hotel for a much needed sleep before travelling home the following morning.It's not a holiday going to Disneyland Paris, it is tiring, especially for the kiddies, but it really is a great few days away and if you can afford to go at Christmas then do it, it makes Disneyland paris all that bit more magical.Ignore the negativity and dust off your magic carpet and get involved.Disneyland Paris   10 10.",Disneyland_Paris
146798600,5,2012-11,Turkey,"Actually it has many things for every age. But for the kids and youth, it must be a dream, an heaven.We stayed 4 nights and had 5 days in park and studio. Thanks for 20th anniversary promotion, only paid for 2 nights. Since it was winter time, it was closed earlier than in summer time. So I think at least 3 days is necessary in winter and 2 days in summer. But I assure you, you'll be exhausted in any case. Being with more people is an advantage as you can get activities in groups in order to avoid unnecessary waiting in queues. Yes, despite the cold weather, there were relatively long queues for certain attractions.What amazed me was the discipline and kindness of all staff from ticket seller to role players. We never feeled annoyed.For the big guys and girls, I recommend Space Mountain. My 6yo daughter's favourite was  this is small world . Daytime parades and at the end of the day, Disney Dreams show are must see.Only thing I can tell as negative was the food options. If you like fast food, no problem though! It was a bit pricey too.Don't forget to get a fast entry card if there's a disabled person in the family. They, with family members, have priority access to every activity without exception.Nice stay.",Disneyland_Paris
146771822,4,2012-9,Russia,"Being in Paris with kids we could not help but go to Disneyland. At least children would not leave Paris without this. Remembering my childhood impressions from 1994 I was expecting same mind blowing experience and unforgettable memories. I have to admit children absolutely loved it. It is not easy to find your way to proper attractions as they are not marked for ages (rather they have hight limitations) but if you do then happy faces are guaranteed. And this is why you'd go there I guess. What I did not like is that for every attraction there are 2 shops, 2 cafes and 2 restaurants. It is actually a huge catering cash machine rather than an amusement park. It did not make any difference to kids though so it is probably for parents to suffer. Few practical advicesSeptmeber is actually a very good time to go. Still warm but not too crowded. Start with rear attractions and go clock wise. People tend to occupy what they see first and it is not always the best choice. We still had to stand in queues for 30  40 minutes in various places beacuse we arrived rather late (after 11 am). Elder children would not go to easy stuff. However, more sophisticated attractions are primarily roller coaster type and sometimes they are really hard so be prepared. Really good one (that we all liked) was Buzz character (Toy story?) related attraction. Trully interactive and with real action. Highly recommended. Do not waste your time on old cars ride. Huge queue but no fun. Book your lunch in advance. Even at that time of the year it was not easy to find a place. Overall. Worth a visit. Smaller kids have more choice. High quality built. Kids will definitely appreciate and remember.",Disneyland_Paris

146544673,3,2012-11,Ireland,"Visited the Disney Park for a fourth time & left feeling disappointed with the disimprovement in the park. For starters, the whole place just looked dirtier   lots of litter and cigarette butts around the grounds, broken characters on some of the rides, broken chairs or chariots on some rides, bits and pieces in need of simple maintenance. There were several attractions that were not running while we were there   the Tea Cups & Space mountain were being  refurbished  so maybe it has been recognized that some work is needed. Some of the restaurants were also closed but given that the food is really expensive & terrible quality its no bad thing. Do not eat in the park! I thought the staff looked quite miserable and disinterested in some cases. There are a lot of people walking around smoking   definitely should be banned outright in the park. I would say that the park is below the standard that you would expect from Disney. Given that it's the 20th Anniversary, I was expecting a lot more.",Disneyland_Paris

We stayed from 25th November 2012 to 27th November 2012. The Christmas Cavalcade was amazing, a little shorter than I envisaged but still magical to watch! The Disney Dreams show in the evenings was simply stunning! Its a shame that at the weekend the show isn't on until 10pm   after a day of travelling, we felt it was a little late but so worth watching!! The park was decked out ready for Christmas which just added to the magic. I am also 5 months pregnant and after reading Trip Advisor found out that I could get an expectant mother pass which means you can bypass any big queues to save you standing up too long. It was beneficial on the Sunday when the park was busy, but didn't really need to use it on Monday and Tuesday. The only downside to the Park was the amount of smokers around, however the parks were really clean and cigarette ends were regularly swept up. Food here is plentiful but I would recommend you eat in the Disney Village not the Studios or Park as we found the prices more reasonable in the Village.",Disneyland_Paris
146462638,5,2012-11,United Kingdom,"2 x 40 something adults arrived at park Sunday afternoon had tickets for both parks for 4 days Sunday   Wedensday. Very clean, staff very helpful and friendly. Going in November there were hardly any queues for the rides, 60 minutes was the longest we waited and that was on the Sunday, the rest of the days we more or less walked straight on and could 'go again' no problem!! We did find food very expensive, but as we had no children we had a decent breakfast before the park then just a snack or a beer if needed (beer was) in the park, best to go back to the Disney Vullage for food we found, but still pricey!! Talking of prices all very muchness of a muchness, we had a few drinls in the Disneyland hotel itself, worth a visit, and they were no more expensive than our hotel (New York). 4 days was enough for us, but we only went on the 'big thrills' rides, enjoyable but done them to death in the 4 days. The light show is a 'must see' 7pm everynight, it was one of the highlights, if not thee highlight of the break. Christmas lights and parades at this time of year were great to, would recommend this time. Wer have bever been to Disney in America so this is not a comparison to that.

Had lunch at a sit down restaurant in the park and I don't think I've ever been served a meal that was as poorly prepared as the one I received.

146413443,2,2012-11,United States,"This park is certainly not up to the standards of the Disney resorts I visited in Florida and California (FL as a Child, CA as a child and adult). Disney is a company that prides itself on excellent service, and you don't find it here. Yes, I realize it is Disney, yes, I realize it is Paris, so yes I realize it's going to be expensive. However, what goes on here is over the top, bordering on extortion. Hot water and a Tea Bag (not a good brand, either), well over 3 EUR, Bottle of Diet Coke for 4, Beer for 7? Not to mention the food options and quality are just not there. At other Disney locations you can get a wide array of culinary options, the food choices were limited here and they were expensive. Toilets were not clearly marked. Yes, they give you a map, but when you've got a 5 year old and 2.5 year old who need to go immediately, it's not always conducive to check the map. The restrooms were unsanitary in many cases and baby changing facilities were poor non existent, which I found odd for a park that caters to children. I only found changing facilities in a few men's rooms and it was a cold metal slab, luckily we had a blanket. Smoking is not limited to designated areas like it is at theme parks in the UK and US: Smokers can light up anywhere and they are rather rude about doing so. Even areas where smoking was not supposed to be allowed, such as in queues for rides or shows, the staff did not enforce the smoking ban. All in all, this Disney park has a long way to go before it is worthy of the name Disney.",Disneyland_Paris
146395444,2,2012-11,United States,"After spending so much time in the Disney flagship park in Anaheim, we were very surprised to see Disney Paris looking so rundown and somewhat shabby on the edges. In Anaheim, there are cast members constantly maintaining the bathrooms, the streets and every little nitch of the park. If there is chipped paint on the teacups, there is someone there at midnight to repaint. Not so in Disney Paris. Again, the bathroom smell could make you throw up, and it didn't look like maintenance had been there in a week! The painted railings for the queues were all worn off exposing the bare metal. The one bright spot was our lunch at Walt's restaurant. The food and ambience were quite good, although we had better value at a small bistro in Paris. It is just sad to me that the Disney company would take such pristine care with Anaheim and not do the same for Paris. Considering how the company prides itself on the  guest experience,  they really should apply the same level of care to each and every park that bears their name.",Disneyland_Paris

The hotel is tired looking and not that clean, and public toilets are terrible! Disney fleece you for everything including wi fi charges by the hour and do not even provide coffee in hotel bedrooms   unlike EVERY hotel I have ever been to in the world?

Wow Disneyland in Paris felt so magical. My sisters and I loved the attractions. Not a contender to Disneyland in Florida though. We tucked in to a nice restaurant in the park. Mmm it was good, but terribly over priced. We went to see a Beauty and a Beast show and I enjoyed it very much even though I was quite old. Just goes to show that you can never get too old for Disneyland! The staff were very friendly, I loved their accents. They were especially nice to the kids around, the kids around me seemed to think they were in some magical world. Dreams do come true in there! Lines for rides were very long, but thats expected because I knew that tourists from all around the world came there to visit. The elevator ride was the best, the men in their costume acting scary made it all the more better.The biggest highlight for me was meeting Mickey and Minnie the characters I grew up to watch as a kid. It was the best moment of my life, it was very special for me, also meeting all the pretty princesses!

We went on the first one at 8.30am after a 10min wait and when we went to the next one the queues were beginning to exceed 30 minutes for most of them. After 10am you could be waiting up to 1 hour so use the fastback where possible for the big ones.Despite the hanging about we enjoyed every minute of the weekend and some fool (me this time) is looking at Florida in February.",Disneyland_Paris

146092958,5,2012-11,United States,"Having been to Orlando and never been to Disneyland, time had come to address this issue with a two night stay at Disneyland Paris. Drove to resort via the Euro Tunnel. The Euro tunnel is very slick and once off at Calais, set the SAT NAV up got on the motorway and before you knew it, your there. If stuck for time, choose the motorway as its quieter and for 21 euros toll charge each way relatively cheap, for the time saved. If you want to see more of rural France take the A roads.The accomodation I choose at the resort was the Hotel New York. The layout and facilities very similar to theme hotels in the States. We were met buy very helpful, polite staff who explained the details of the hotel and distance from hotel to theme park.The hotel has the 'Big Apple' New York theme running through it. The hotel room and bathroom were very clean and tidy, with comfortable firm beds. There was a mini bar, but no coffee tea making facilitiy. TV in room older style and sound not very good, but like some of the furniture, a little dated and almost ready for upgrading.The indoor swimming pool was a welcome retreat early in the morning as very few children and a small steam room and sauna within the changing room area added to the wind down after a day in the theme park with my family.The parks were a short walk from the hotel. As you got nearer the the entrance the park ( which ever one you chose) started to release its magic for young and old alike. Mickey Mouse and co. are the main attraction, but Disney are giving you the up to date characters like Buzz Light Year etc to attract the younger generation.The queues for certain rides ( those for smaller children ) were quite long but not too bad. The weather was cold but dry.Did have fast passes but didnt use them. As in any theme park study the layout in the guide and note the times of parades as you some times have to get positioned along the parade route early to get a good view.The two attractions I really enjoyed were The Twilight Zone Tower Of Terror and the very action packed Stunt Show Spectatular featuring Lightning McQueen. As darkness falls the Christmas lighting and decoration around the parks really does transform the surroundings. The Disney Dreams spectacular with very clever use of lazers, water jets and fire works is well worth waiting for as the park closes. The Sleeping Beauty Castle is lit up with so much colour and images of Disney characters projected onto its walls its difficult not to be amazed. Not sure if it is on every night.All in all a bit of what is done so well in the States, in Europe.",Disneyland_Paris
146092491,2,2012-11,United Kingdom,"Stayed at the Disney Newport Bay hotel for 3 nights whilst visiting Euro Disney. If you have already been to Disneyworld Florida, then you are going to be extremely disappointed. I visited in November and it was not only the weather that was cold and frosty!!!! The staff in the park are extremely rude! obvioulsly not lovers of their jobs and not afraid to show it! No smiley friendly faces anywhere, with the exception of one older man in the Christmas wonderland area, who was actually very nice to our family. The 2 parks themselves are very nice with a good choice of rides and the usual parades, but it was extremely busy for November. The wait times were ridiculous, some up to 90 mins (not expected at this time of year), and the amount of times that the rides had  broken down  were beyond belief. i began to wonder if they were just trying to cut down on costs by having them out of action for various periods during the day. It didnt help when they let rides go half empty, no single riders etc to speed up queues. Character greeetings had no structure what so ever. A character would appear, no ropes to line up and wait your turn to have your photos, autograph books signed, it was a matter of french people first by pushing others out of the way and everyone waiting for a chance to push in to the scrum! Food at the park is totally overpriced with a soft drink costing on average   6 and a burger takeaway meal   12. If you are looking for something half decent don't look for any change out of   100   125 for 2 adults and 2 children and even then you are getting pretty basic food. The evening show at the castle was lovely and worth seeing. Shopping was same as food and at least 50% more expensive than uk and 100% greater than US. If you want you can take your own food and drinks into the park, we seen a lot of people doing this and it is accepted by Disney. If you are staying at any of the Disney hotels then there is the usual transportation to the park, but they are all witihin walking distance. We were quicker walking from our Hotel (Newport Bay) to the park than waiting on the transport, it was only a 5 10 mins walk. Disneyland Paris just doesnt have the same slickness as its counterpart in Florida. I will never return. i would advise looking at spending a little more on getting to Florida because what you will spend in 14 days, the service, the people, the choice you receive is night and day and probably cost you no more that the money you would spend on a short break to Disneyland Paris!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris

Queues weren't too bad   the waiting time showing at the entrance to most rides was an over estimate, which was good! The only negative thing about waiting in the queues is that most Europeans don't seem to understand the concept! So be prepared to tackle queue jumpers!The parade was at 5 o'clock when we went and definitely worth seeing. We were also there for the bonfire Fireworks spectacular which was amazing and definitely the highlight of the day  well worth waiting around in the cold for!

I wish there was as I had a buggy that was stolen. There are buggy parks and that is where my buggy was stolen. So either rent a Disney buggy at    12 for the day or buy a bicycle lock.

The staff in City Hall gave us a pass and explained how to use it., they were very pleasant.Sadly Disney have not told any of their ride operators about it and we were treated like S*$T.The 2 carers stated they would NEVER return and will advise all other parents NOT to consider it as they had never been anywhere so UNFRIENDLY to the disabled.Most of the disabled exits marked for your use are UNMANNED which ties in with the Disney approach of   Who cares, we already have yer cash   One of my carers assisted a family group who were in the wrong queue and would have stood there forever ignored by park staff and took them to where they could actually access a ride.Complete SO WHAT attitude by all ride staff. Told to go to the back of the queue , what was my problem ??? Must have inhaled around 100 cigs by passive smoking as its EVERYWHERE.

145840845,5,2012-11,United Kingdom,"My husband and I took my little brother here for a holiday in early November. We were worried that at twelve he might be getting too old for his first Disneyland visit, but he absolutely loved it! Was lovely seeing him walking around the park filling the pages of his autograph book.Our first day in the park was the ninth of November, which was the first day of the Christmas celebrations. Throughout the day you could meet many Disney characters in their Christmas attire by the gazebo on Main Street USA. We got to meet Mickey, Minnie, Chip, Dale, Duffy, Stitch and Angel. Winnie the Pooh was also further down Main Street for most of the day and we met Jack Skelington near the Haunted Mansion in Frontierland. It's well worth picking up a programme as you enter the park as some of the characters have set times and locations to appear.The Christmas parade is shown three times a day (usually at 11:15, 12:15 and 13:15) and features Mickey and friends as well as Santa and his elves. The kids will love it! The main parade, Disney Magic, is usually around four in the afternoon and featured floats based on all the classic stories (Lion King, Peter Pan, Toy Story etc) there is also a special float with all the Disney princesses on and a final float for Mickey and friends. You need to be there about 40 60 minutes before to get a decent spot though!The 20th Anniversary is being extended until September 2013 so make sure you catch Disney Dreams   the new night time show in honour of the anniversary. Peter Pan's shadow travels through many of the traditional Disney stories in holograms shown on Sleeping Beauty's Castle. The lasers and fireworks are amazing. It will be the highlight of your trip!Also if you're staying in a Disney hotel you get 1 or 2 'extra magic hours' in the park (depending on the day), these are definetely worth taking advantage of! Selected rides in Fantasyland and Discoveryland are open before the park opens to other visitors. (Adventureland and Frontierland are closed off completely). The rides tend to be: Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Mad Hatter's Tea Cups, Lancelot's Carousel, Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast, Orbitron and Space Mountain. Most of these rides have extremely long queues later in the day (especially Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast an Space Mountain) but at this time in the morning you can practically walk straight on!

145792052,4,2012-11,United Kingdom,"We have visited Disneyland Park in Paris many times and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, but having just returned from this year's visit I have to warn people about the hoards of smokers EVERYWHERE. They have no regard for the fact that smoking is only allowed in designated areas and if you have small children you'll be lucky if they don't get a cigarette in the eye at some stage, as people walk around in crowded areas swinging their arms aound with cigarettes in their hands, just at the height of any child under 5. I visited city hall to inform them of my concerns and was told that smoking is  tolerated    come on Disney   hoards of smoking adults, endangering children is not what Walt had in mind. The reason it works well in America (we have visited both Orlando and Anaheim many times) is because people embrase the concept and put their children first   in France they'll just tell you (and this is what they said at city hall) that French law says they can smoke outside, and most of them do, I've never been among so many smokers, puffing clouds of smoke into your face until your feel ill and then littering the place because they can't be bothered to find a bin. Disney need to police their rules, starting with clear and may I suggest LARGE signs at the entrance to and around the park. There are plenty of staff patrolling the park so STOP THE SMOKERS   THERE IS NO EXCUSE. If you're afraid of the French people Disney   then I'll come over and do it for you!!

145761874,3,2012-11,United Kingdom,"Being a big kid we first went to Disneyland 18 years ago when I was pregnant with our son. 8 years later we took him with us and had such a magical time we stayed another three times staying at the Cheyenne (ok but you fight for a table at breakfast) once and the New York twice. By the last time, two years ago we felt that no effort was being put in by Disney to keep the magic alive and our most recent trip, a day trip, confirmed it had sunk lower. I know that there is money to be saved in the current climate but surely Disney doesn't have to cut back quite so much. Rides were closed, catering wagons were closed, restaurants were closed. The one we knew was a good deal (the chuck wagon) had changed its menu which is expected but a meal that used to contain half a chicken is now reduced to a turkey drumstick and you have no chance of a burger without sauce as 'it is impossible'!! I know it was November but if you've paid to go you expect it all to be open. We always go in November, usually the end of the first week and the Christmas theme is usually in full swing with festive music, carol singers etc but this time the Christmas decorations were sparse and their just didn't seem to be any atmosphere.

145724876,4,2011-12,United Kingdom,"I had always wanted to visit Disneyland as a child but our family never had the funds to do so, So at 32 years old I was really excited to go as part of our honeymoon.The park was relatively quiet when we visited in September 2011 and this was a huge bonus, as you walk into the park you can see the magnificent Disney castle in the distance whilst looking down the busy Main street, on the main street you can shop in the many Disney related stores, Gents can get their hair cut in the barbers, there are also places where you can get into a horse drawn car or eat in one of the many restaurants, we especially liked the cake bar.We went on almost all of the rides but were upset to see that the phantom manor ride was closed due to maintenance.We headed for frontier land first and went on big thunder mountain, the queue was less than ten minutes and then headed to the Thunder mesa riverboat landing, this was a large steam boat which goes around frontier land and is great if you want to put your feet up and relax from walking for a little while, this lasts about 15 minutes.After this we went to adventure land and went on the Indiana jones ride which was not a fun ride for me, I usually love this type of ride and frequently go to Alton towers but all I got out of this was neck pain as it jolts you quite violently on the loops and we only went on this the once as that was enough, The pirates of the caribean ride is quite dated but non the less still quite entertaining, you sit in a boat and traverse through several sets with pirate activity in the background, this is another good ride to get your energy levels back up as it is a good 15 minutes long and is quite gentle.Fantasy land is more for younger children than fully grown adults but we still enjoyed looking around the castle and there is a fantastic glass shop in which you can watch people making delicate glass ornaments which is a great thing to see.Then we went over to Discovery land and Captain Eo was closed but that did not really phase us, our highlight of this area of the park was the star tours and getting a pic with Chewbacca, we also went on the buzz light year ride and space mountain.A good time to try these rides are when the parades and shows are on as everyone gravitates to them.All in all we had a great time and would go again   probably off season again as the weather was pleasant and we did not have to queue for ages for anything.",Disneyland_Paris
145651842,2,2012-11,France,"OBJECTIVE REVIEW FROM ANNUAL PASS HOLDER   TOP TIPS: PLEASE READWe were annual pass holders for this park for a few consecutive years because we live close by, so my review is based on many visits. We are no longer frequent visitors mainly because of the following three reasons:1) the park is relatively small compared to the USA with fewer attractions, yet the park welcomes many visitors daily and wait times can be very long during school holidays (most summer, December) and weekends with average waits 25 90 minutes for most attractions. The worst rides are always Thunder Mountain and the Nemo coaster. It's difficult to find days that are quiet (usually limited to some wintry week days in Jan Feb)2) often the waiting lines are poorly managed and it is not unusual for parallel lines to move at significantly different speeds. Picking the right one requires some luck. This in combination with sometimes rude visitors cutting lines, pushing etc, has often caused us much frustration. 3) the worst thing is many many people smoking in the park, everywhere, all the time. There are constantly clouds of tobacco smoke drifting across your walking path. Smoking is not allowed in lines, but it's not really enforced. Just recently, I had a big argument with a visitor who flatly refused to put out their cigarette in a line, among children. On another occasion, I had to alert management of a group of teenage girls smoking marihuana in a line. I blame management for this as there should be a blanket ban that is continuously enforced, with widespread signs. Based on that, I feel the park deserves no more than one star, but my review has to stay objective and there are certainly also some good points about the park (beautifully landscaped, beautiful Cinderella castle, Nemo coaster)TOP TIPS:1) bear in mind the above points, so you are prepared. If possible, best to avoid visiting around any school holidays, the summer and weekends2) regardless, arrive either very early or arrive late to leave late during extended opening hours (weekends, summers). Waiting times drop off significantly a few hours before late closing hours as people get tired. Even better to split the day in two or visit 1 2 days several days. It's not an endurance race. Kids (and adults) get tired and cranky3) Walt Disney Studio's are fairly small but have some good attractions (Tower of Terror, Lilo & Stitch show, Nemo Coaster, Playhouse Disney show, Toystory land)4) get a fast pass as soon as you arrive (Thundermountain is a good bet). You can only get a fast pass for another attraction after the time has lapsed on the first one. No fast passes at Studio's.5) waiting time for the Nemo coaster at Walt Disney's studio's are usually long all day long, there is little point in postponing the wait. It's a very nice ride, worth the wait. Probably best for first thing in the morning6) quality of the food is not great and expensive. Best bets are the Hakuma Matata (fast food) or Blue Lagoon (table service, expensive). 7) if you are tired of the lines, try the slow train ride around the park, the steam boat, Adventure Island. Also, Phantom Manor's waiting times are also usually reasonable.",Disneyland_Paris

145578056,3,2011-12,United Kingdom,"Since we were staying in Gare de Lyon it was very convenient to get there, taking about 30 minutes to get to the park. Considering you are getting off in Disneyland, the station was a mess. The bins were overflowing with rubbish and we weren't feeling the Disney spirit at that point. Get tickets in advance, they're usually cheaper and the ticket booth is not well signposted outside the entrance.On entry to the main park it was very well laid out, you walk through the village to start and signposts point you in the general direction of specific themes. They have parades with all the characters on at certain times of the day which were fun to watch, but there weren't any characters wandering around. We were expecting to bump into Mickey, Minnie, Donald and the rest of the crew but alas no. In fact the only characters brave enough to walk the streets seemed to be Tweedle dee and Tweedle dum and they were having a smoke break behind the toilets.The place was very crowded. People shoving their way through the crowds and trying to remove Disney items from the clutches of their needy kids.*Tip   Disney is in the business of making money thus merchandising is everywhere! Accept this, if you have a problem with it, don't go or learn how to say no to your kids : ) It's character building.We tried to see everything and go on a few rides. The queues were long for all the rides so waiting is the name of the game. One of the good ones was the haunted house, although people talking loudly throughout the narration was a little annoying.*Tip   If the ride says  Not Acceptable For Children  there's probably a reason. Judging by the number of children crying and looking shell shocked at the end, it would appear Disney don't post the warnings for kicks and giggles. Added entertainment though on exit.For smokers, Disney are kind enough to provide smoking areas for the stressed. Oddly you do still get people glaring at you with theatrical coughing while you enjoy your small dose of nicotine regardless of being in the approved zones. It's little wonder why people end up smoking anywhere.Food was what you would expect from a theme park, we had lunch in the Ali Baba section which was very pleasant and good value since it was unlimited.We read a lot of reviews about the Tea Cup ride. The queue was long and the ride was short. People had actually timed the ride and complained about adults without children enjoying the experience. We rode it anyway. Our ride was approximately 33 seconds long, which actually was the longest we had timed while we were queuing and also the longest we had read about on TA. And no, we didn't agree little Tarquin deserved to jump the queue.We had a great day, all of the things we saw just added to the enjoyment of the day. Don't expect a full Disney experience except for the merchandising.",Disneyland_Paris
145550994,4,2012-11,United Kingdom,"great attractions for the kids, plenty of fast food places and loads and loads of Disney related shops. however the park staff were ignorant, stood in the long Qs for the photos and autographs, all the shops were disney junk, couldn't get any real food, the kids couldn't get to the front to see the parads. the rides were very short to reduce the Qing. it was overal a mixed experience and I think the company should take on board some off the complaints. for what it costs you should get more value for money. the pathways were littered with cigarette butts even though there were loads of cleaners. if you spend the full day there and for a family of 4 it will set you back at least   100 plus for food.",Disneyland_Paris

145535746,5,2012-11,United Kingdom,"Without question the magic of Disney will get you after a very short time in Disneyland Paris. BUT   you must plan your visit. Choose your rides, choose your shows   DO NOT miss the 5.00p.m. Parade (Fantastic, get here early to get a front row place) or the Awe inspiring fireworks Laser Show at 8.30p.m. I have never seen anything so wonderful as this.White knuckle rides : Thunder Mountain (great fun), Space Mountain (neve again) and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. (not for me)Interesting and rides with great effects : Pirates of the carribean (Brilliant   the Jonny Depp films were based on this); PeterPan's Ride, The Haunted House (Wow! You see Ghosts dancing); It's a Small World   very charming. So many others. Do not miss the Dragon in the Castle Dungeons. Or Micheal Jackson. Food is not cheap. One cafe had baguettes on offer ranging from 14 euros to 16 euros. Cheapest meal was approx 12.50 euros (without drinks) And Gentlemen   if you fancy a quick drink   (as a 'pick me up) forget it. You may be able to get a beer with a meal but that's about it. Perhaps Walt was a teetotaller. Hey ho!!otherwise, everything is fantastic. A WORD OF WARNING  Beware the shops. The whole place is designed to encouage you to spend. So many people did. At great cost. Be careful you are not not temped to buy things that are not quite so appealing when you arrive home........ otherwise   have fun! It's marvellous",Disneyland_Paris
145488444,4,2012-11,United States,took my 11 yr old daughter for a 2 night stay bonfire night display had a full day at the park which closed at seven ready for the fireworks wich started at nine thirty i thought it was a bit late after getting up so early. Would reccomend that u use the fast pass tickets to book a ride that u would like to go on as waiting times r long the places for food in the village r really expensive and r not worth the money paid there is a macdonalds there and it is the same price as back home so dont go paying 15 pound for a burger or hot dog in the other cafes the french guests r really rude and ignorant and will just barge past u on the rides and go straight to front with a family trailing behind so dont be afraid to stop them or u will wait for ever they r paying guests like us all.we stayed at the santa fe hotel which. was ok for the amount of time that u spend there clean and tidy and a nice warm comfy room .Only had half a day left and went to the universal studio part of the park which i thought was real good and the rides were amazing would like to return one day with the granchildren.,Disneyland_Paris
145463090,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,"As you would expect, Disney are the daddy of theme parks and clearly a lot of thought has gone in to the customer experience at this place. This was our third visit.However, its success is its biggest weakness! If you don't like queuing upwards of 1 hour for a ride then this is not the place for you.Also, having spent   196 for one day's entry for 2 adults and 2 children, how can they also justify a charge of 15 Euros for parking there? The souvenirs were a rip off but a necessary evil, especially when travelling with children!And finally the other gripe that we had was the very limited range of dishes for non meat eaters.That said, if you do go then make sure you take advantage of their 20th Anniversary tickets this year. Our ticket allowed us to visit both parks, benefit from late closure and the highlight of the day was the firework and light display at 10pm.Top tips are plan ahead of your visit, take advantage of the Fast Trak system and spend more than 1 day to do it justice.",Disneyland_Paris
145459384,2,2012-6,United States,"My granddaughter (age 10) and I spent over a week in London and Paris. On the last day of our trip we decided to go to the Paris Disneyland. As it was the end of June, it was very crowded. The Disney staff was no where near as pleasant or accommadating as in the Florida Disney, in fact, most were neutral to downright rude. We did both parks in one day   very small compared to Disney World. The food venues were crowded and overpriced, but the same can be said with Florida. We waited in line for both food and rides, as expected. But what was not expected was that whole families of people would push ahead and cut the line. This happened 4 times while we were there. When others complained, it did no good. As for characters, we only saw 2  princesses  hurrying off toward their break. If you are an American and have access to Disney World, don't bother with this. Even my granddaughter was a bit dissappointed.",Disneyland_Paris
145456024,5,2012-11,United Kingdom,"Had a great 2 night 3 day break at Disneyland Paris 7th 9th November 2012 (incorporating bonfire celebrations and 1st day of Christmas season)  2 adults and 2 children aged 4 and 2 years, staying onsite at Santa Fe hotel. Firstly I'll admit I've not been to any other Disney's (WDW Florida etc), but know that WDW is on a completely different scale to DLP, so am reviewing this purely on my family's experience of DLP as a stand alone attraction.Pros highlights  Highlight of the trip DREAMS hands down   amazing, emotive, saw it both nights would never tire of seeing it   even hubby was impressed and converted to Disney after seeing this show. for us full of disney magic   very convincing fake snow, festive music, bright colours, didn't appear run down to us quite well maintained in fact  just feels 'different' and 'magical' compared to your average theme park good crowd management we found although lots of people in the park,the flow of people was managed relatively well although a bit crowded leaving the park at end of Dreams Easy to get to   we went direct via eurostar (express baggage service excellent), great with young kids as no long haul flight involved or anything! Smaller than WDW, makes it easier to navigate park and less tiring for little feet. I'd say a good introduction to Disney holidays for smaller children (am going to start saving in the new year for florida once the kids are a bit bigger)Cons  Expensive but then to be expected for Disney (exchange rate wasn't too bad which softened the blow!) Research beforehand so you can prepare your budget so don't end up with a shock when you're there! Character Meet and Greets in the park can involve a bit of a jostle but never really had any problems with this, son always managed to have photo taken with characters he waited for and I do not feel French children were picked before over him. we also did 2 character meals which gave quality time with the characters. Queue times can be long (up to an hour) especially in studios but then again we did visit during the French school holidays. Try and make use of Extra Magic Hours if staying on site, and fast pass tickets. We managed to do all we wanted to rides wise in the park but found the studio queues were laughable! so missed out on a couple of things in there It is very tiring and involves lots of walking   you can make use of shuttle buses from Disneyland hotels, which take you straight into the park to reduce on walking. I'd say you need 3 days to cover both the park and studios, and I did look at where I wanted to go in the parks rides parade times and write a rough itinerary which helped things to flow smoothly unpredictable weather   however, we were very lucky and it didn't rain and wasn't too cold we didn't rate the bonfire firework display   much like any display you'd see anywhere else   non Disney music playing and missed the disney 'magic'For what it's worth we didn't come across any rude French people they were all pleasant and cast members helpful   I did try and speak in broken french to show willing! Yes people smoke in the park but it was never 'too much' or in our faces so a non issue for us. Food expensive but we found the quality of food good. Even hot dogs etc in the park were fine.",Disneyland_Paris
145414244,3,2012-11,United Kingdom,"I had a lovely few days at Disneyland Paris, but was disgusted by the fact that the park is not a non smoking area. You can smoke in all outside areas.

This is Disney..not family friendly at all.",Disneyland_Paris

145294166,4,2012-10,Australia,"This was my second trip to a Disneyland Park in two years but my first time to Disneyland Paris. It was exactly as I expected in terms of similarities to the Disneyland Park in Anaheim (U.S.A). We went during what must have been the low season as most of the food outlets were closed but there were minimal people to deal with for rides. Lines were short for everything except on Big Thunder Mountain (for which the fast pass was definately used). So many things to do in one day, I didn't even have time to check out the Studios (which I had a ticker for). If you want to do both parks, definately give yourself two days. A downside to the day   I wish there was more food outlet seating undercover (or more seating full stop) as it was raining for the later part of the day. No matter which park you go to, it is guaranteed to be a day that will leave you acting like a big kids and smiling all the time.",Disneyland_Paris
145287977,3,2012-9,Australia,"I am one of those lucky people who have been to all the Disneylands and feel like I am in a position to compare. It is not a patch on the 2 USA ones but it was a lot more easier to navigate. I think economic times must be hitting because many of the attractions were closed down in the second park. I felt the ''Haunted House'' was actually the ber than those in the other parks but the rest of the rides had no flair. Sorry! It's a ''small small world'' was still fabulous. The day we went was a Friday and we never had to wait more than 5 minutes to go on anything. The Restaurants were awful but that is not just restricted to Paris. Hong Kong is disastrous!!! The Grand Parade was magnificent and the colour was terrific. It is something you can do in one day even with the 35 minute trip to Marne La Vallee from Paris thrown in. I don't know, it just doesn't have the magic that the others have. Maybe I should learn French!!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
145278825,1,2012-11,United States,"Disneyland Park outside of Paris, France does not have mobility scooters for rent inside the park. I choose not to go inside because I have trouble walking for a long time and if you have been to any Disney Park there is a lot of walking involved. The cashier suggested I could rent a wheelchair to have someone push me but I traveled alone and even if someone had been with me I would not have asked them to spend a whole day pushing me around. The Metro and Trains stations in Paris were also a huge problem  endless stairs up and down and very few elevators. France is not for the faint of heart or anyone with any problems walking and climbing stairs. Good Luck and Happy Travels.",Disneyland_Paris
145183694,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,"As theme park regulars in the UK, I did have quite high hopes of Disney   and was not disappointed. We had booked an in all trip so had picked up our tickets before arriving at the park so after the seemingly endless trip to the entrance, went straight in. The 'no picnicking' rule may seem slightly scary, but I suspect this is more to do with deterring people taking in loads of stuff. We took in drinks and sandwiches with some small cakes without any issues. I think if you were taking in enough for a whole day, you may have problems, so expect to have to buy something, but it is possible to take some food in with you.We were in Disney for 2 days and spent the entire of the first day in Disneyland. Just looking down Maine Street can take a couple of hours, and by early afternoon we have only got as far as Discoveryland!! The Fast Pass tickets are a good idea and we used them a few times for Laserblast and the X Fighter experience, though there was plenty to see without even going on rides! We walked through to Fantasyland mid afternoon, before heading back to Maine Street for the 5pm parade. The programme says be early, suggesting 4.30pm, but seriously, by 4.30pm most good spots were already gone!! At this point, our 6yo got a bit moany, however the parade was well worth it!Certainly at the time of year we visited, the park became much quieter after 5pm and we managed to get on quite a lot of rides between 5pm and 9.30pm, literally walking straight onto popular rides like It's A Small World and Dumbo, before making our way to the end of Maine Street for the end of day show, which is spectacular!The second day, we spent the morning in the Studio Park (review to be posted soon) and the afternoon in Disneyland, visiting the parts of the park we had not managed the day before  and not even managing that! We were booked into the Cowboy Cookout (see review) and then hopped onto the train to see the rest of the park, however this broke down at the first station, which was disappointing!In hindsight, I think you would really need 2 full days to see the park, let alone go on the rides! It is a long day from 10am to 10pm (even longer if you get Extra Magic Hours) but worth it. There is so much to see, without even going on the rides, and we didn't even look for characters or shows!!Already planning next visit....",Disneyland_Paris

145125196,4,2012-10,Australia,"I'm a Disney fan and going to each Disney park is on my bucket list. Until I'd visited Paris I had only been to the 4 Disney parks in Orlando.We had pre purchased our  2 parks in 1 day  tickets through Viator and although it was cheaper than buying the ticket at the gate it meant we were locked into the specific day. The  tickets  were actually a voucher which needed to be exchanged for real tickets, so we couldn't bypass the long queues. When we reached the front of the queue the staff member couldn't find any reference to our voucher on their system. Although this did mean a delay of 15 minutes at no point did she make us feel like it was our fault   this was a real credit to them. We eventually entered and nothing more was said about the matter. I suspect this isn't common with Viator but I thought I'd share my experience nonetheless.I had done some research and found that it was best to visit the Studios park first and then head to the Disneyland Park later in the day. I was surprised at how very close the two entrances were, literally a stone's throw, nothing at all like Orlando!I had misread a time on the show schedule which meant that we were not going to be able to see all the shows we wanted to in the Studios park. We did however see Animagique and Cinemagique   both of which we thoroughly enjoyed. But there was something missing. I couldn't quite put my finger on it until I realised it was  the magic . The Studios park may as well have been a generic theme park. Sure there were attractions but I didn't feel the Disney Magic. We had lunch at the Studios, thinking that it would be quieter than at the DP, which it probably was but the choices weren't great   and the options were expensive   like all Disney park food is. After lunch we headed to the Disneyland Park and we found some magic. Not as much as we'd experienced before, but maybe that was because it wasn't our first time, or that the skies were grey, or we'd arrived later than expected   whatever... It was still Disney and I still loved it. Some of the attractions were closed but we'd come more for the  magic  than the rides themselves. I've given this a  Very Good  rating instead of  Excellent  because I believe it can be improved. I don't know how the staff (cast members) are trained, but they could take a leaf out of the books of the Orlando cast members. Paris staff are polite and helpful enough but Orlando staff make you feel like you're the most important person in the park   that's the magic.We found our own way to the park and it was our first experience on Paris public transport. We did originally get on the train that was going in the opposite direction, but we soon corrected that and aside from that incident the trip was easy. The train takes you right to the gates.",Disneyland_Paris
145121961,4,2012-10,India,"I recently visited diney Paris. All characters like mickey, Cindrella etc are escorted by a staff ( Mostly girls) who control the crowd(Mostly small children). I distinctly observed for 2 days for most of the characters that they choose to autograph and pose for pictures with the white children largely. Being a non white my children were disappointed on a number of occasions even when they were among first ones to approach a character. Even the staff escorting these characters get the white children to the characters despite they saw our children being there for long time.. On one such occasion finally, when I protested, the girl staff immediately asked the Cindrella to have a picture with my children.If this is really a case, this needs to be urgently corrected.",Disneyland_Paris

144915920,5,2012-6,Monaco,"I travel to Disneyland Paris every year and the Disneyland Park is always excellent: from the rides which are always kept in good conditions (which, I believe, go through a refurbishment at least once a year), to the seasonal themes and anniversaries. Halloween themed park is wonderful, and I would recommend to see the Christmas season, which starts early in November and adds even more magic to the park. This year is the 20th Anniversary of Disneyland Paris, so there are special shows like  Disney Dreams!  that you should not miss! The park is divided in 5 different areas: Main Street, Frontierland, Adventureland, Fantasyland and Discoveryland. The atmosphere is magical and different in each one of them, with the music and surroundings completely unique to each small area.Do not expect the resort to be as big as Walt Disney World in Florida, for example! Though the Disneyland park is  small , it offers a big variety of rides (Pirates of the Caribbean, Phantom Manor & Big Thunder mountain being our favorites). The staff is friendly in the restaurants, boutiques and rides; and the park is also clean considering the huge amount of people that goes there every day.To avoid crowds, there are, of course, the Fast passes (normal ones that come with your hotel reservations and VIP ones, which they provide with  Castle Club  rooms or suites), but also strategic dates which can make you skip long waiting times! I would recommend weekdays (between Tuesdays and Fridays) in less busy periods, such as the end of september, may or june (you should first check that there are not holidays in France!) and also some days in november (though the weather is already colder). During these less busy periods, the prices are also usually lower.If you are planning to go there more than once a year, there is the  Passeport Annuel  (or Annual Passport) which offers discounts on restaurants, hotels and of course, free admission in the parks (beware of the restriction dates!). As for the hotel, the best one in my opinion is the Disneyland Hotel (though a bit more expensive than the other ones), located at the very entrance of the park!Whether you travel with young children, teenagers, as a couple or with friends, the Disneyland Park is an experience you should not miss.",Disneyland_Paris

We went on the Tuesday by free shuttle bus to Disney Parc we went on various rides including Space Mountain not a ride for the lightheartedness like me, but looking back it was ok(even though my eyes were shut throughout and I was praying. We did fantasyland after that how so gentle after such a violent ride fantasyland is where you sit on a boat like pod and it takes you into a huge building with music and dance from puppet in traditional country costumes in my case a couple were in kilts and playing the bagpipes there were hoola hoola dancers from Haiwii it was amazing saw many characters and we got our photo taken with Mickey and various other characters. Word of advice for disabled people take your Blue Badge(UK) WITH YOU AND GO ON YOUR FIRST DAY TO CITY HALL IN THE PARK AND YOU WILL BE GIVEN an exemption standing in queues at rides although there may be a small queue of other disabled people but not so long and you get priority over other members of the public it makes a difference. The Disney studio we went on the Hollywood train worth the ride, not going to spoil it for you.

The queues were long wherever you wanted to go, and you have to suffer rain or too much sun during your wait. Even at the restaurant we had to fight to find a table, just to discover our expensive lunch would probably be overlooked even by stray cats.The place is managed in a very cynical manner, they charge you 9 Euros for a lousy kids stroller, and after waiting for an hour each time just to spend a minute and 20 seconds on flying Dumbo or Buzz Lightyear we broke and travelled back to paris around 6 PM. Our impression was that the management doesn't bother to do anything about this deliberately, as they prefer their fraud victims to return the next day to spend again many hours in the endless queus.The  Fast pass  system also sucks   who is going to wait for his queue for  Peter Pan  at 8:50 PM if he gets the card at 3 PM, and can't get any other  fast pass  until then ?Do not go there, at least not in August and school vacations.",Disneyland_Paris
144788568,4,2012-11,Ireland,"Visited for 4 days over Hallowe'en as part of a hotel & parks package (family of 3 with a 9 year old boy) and wanted to enjoy the experience before my son got too  old  to appreciate it...needn't have worried! From the moment we walked through Disney village to the entrance to the park, until he waved goodbye to the castle from Main St USA, he was totally into the whole Disney dream. The park itself is not for the adrenaline mad thrillseekers, whilst there are a few rollercoasters, I've seen more frightening rides at Port Aventura, but as I don't like them anyway that was fine for me. What you do get is four lands of Disney magic, with shows , rides and character appearances to make even the most cynical visitor smile. Yes there are queues, and yes it may be more expensive than your average theme park but this is no average theme park and you know it from the minute you first set eyes on the sleeping beauty castle. The Pirates ride is probably the highlight of the park and kids will love the Buzz lightyear ride, although there are plenty of others that are worth a go   the free fastpass also a really good idea. The end of day light show and fireworks display is all that you expect from Disney. The Studios park is definitely the poor relation, but still worth a visit, with the Cars stunt show and Cinemagic very enjoyable. Food in the park is a little on the expensive side but I can't say it was over the top, and the free drinks vouchers were useful later on in the day. Would highly recommend it to any paren with young kids   would suggest between 6 10yrs is the ideal time to take them as they can walk for longer (even our son managed a full 3 days without moaning!), and it always gives you the chance to take them back again before they become teenagers!

Obviously speaking English I had to help assistance from one of the visitor people wearing Red rain mac's spoke French so they tried to help as much as possible... As saying this one did try hes luck! But we thought it was funny! Had a wonderful time here and everyone enjoyed themself also reccommend Planet Hollywood not actually that badly priced and Annettes Diner very reasonably priced. Indiana Jones ride is the best! The best part of the whole trip was the amazing fireworks display 'Disney Dreams' at the end of the day at park closure it really is spectacular I have never seen anything like it! This really appeals to all ages of people and not just the really young! I am always looking at returning to Disneyland as I go most years!",Disneyland_Paris
144686956,3,2012-10,United States,If you have ever visited Walt Disney World in Florida this one can not compare. Disneyland Paris is a miniature version of Magic Kingdom and Hollywood Studios. We had the opportunity to visit while in Paris. We love Walt Disney World and wanted to check out Euro Disney. Although it was a nice trip I would not go again. It was extremely busy on a chilly day in October. I know smoking is a common and acceptable habit in France but I was shocked that it was tolerated in a Disney park. People were smoking and throwing buts everywhere! Overall I am glad i had the opportunity to check it out but would suggest spending your money on a nice dinner and skipping Euro Disney.,Disneyland_Paris
144685152,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,it's a lovely experience for the whole family. seeing the castle was amazing the fireworks show is lovely. rides were good as we got there early we managed to go on a few kiddie rides before all the queues started. if you have young kids who can't go on rides you should do the parent swap well worth it.,Disneyland_Paris
144679641,5,2012-10,Denmark,"Great parks, Both Disneyland and Disney studios were great. The kids loved it and we had 4 splendid days at The Disneyland hotel.The attractions within the parks are good and they are very diversified, so there are options for all sizes and ages. We were there during autumn holidays in Denmark not that many people so no long lines at the attractions, which was fantastic. I must recommend the lunch with princesses at restaurant Auberge if you have girls with you, my two girls of 5 and 8 loved it. Good food too.Go watch some of The shows too they are of high quality and very well performed. All in all a great experience with a nice trip to magic fantasy world og disney characters, plus a very cool light show every evening during the celebration of the 20th anniversary.",Disneyland_Paris
144675085,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,"I have read that some people find the Disneyland Paris site quite small . It is a bit different when you are travelling with an older parent who cannot walk very far. It can be done though. We travelled from Ashford on the Disney Express Eurostar which worked very well. We paid extra for the express check in which was useful as we were able to do the check in at Ashford and put our labels on our cases and get our park tickets.Once we arrived we were able to ditch our bags at the bag drop and head towards the park. We had already worked out we needed to hire a wheelchair for my Mum so we headed straight to the wheelchair and buggy hire which is hidden behind a shop to the right just beyond the park entrance. We had to leave a credit card slip imprint as a deposit and pay 6 euros a day to hire. We were then advised to go to city hall to get a special access permit. Mum needed proof of her disabiltity for this   she had a copy of her bluebadge and DWP letter. We were given a little green card with information for the park staff. This little permit was a godsend as it gave us access to the disabled access of some rides that mum could transfer into and ride with us:for Its a small world and Pirates of the carribean you had to get a ticket to pre book a time to ride. Some rides such as the haunted house and Buzz light year we could go up to he disabled entrance and we would be put on the ride. Mum could not do the more adventurous rides so she had to wait outside while the rest of us enjoyed the thrills of Space Mountain mission 2, Big Thunder mountain, Rock n Roller coaster and Tower of terror   as much as possible we used the fast pass so she was not left on her own for too long. Where possible I pre booked restaurants and used the half board vouchers to make budgeting easier, the deluxe vouchers were expensive but eating at the Inventions restaurant ( excellent choice of food)and the Auberge de Cendrillon was well worth while and the whole family loved getting photos with the characters. We stayed at the Hotel New York   booked because it was the nearest hotel to the park other than the Disneyland Hotel which was not in our budget for this trip. It was very nice apart from the lack of air con I have mentioned in another review. The pool was lovely but we don't mind the water being on the cool side as we like to swim. All in all there was plenty to do for 2 adults 2 older children ( 10 & 11 yrs) and a grandparent enjoying a second child hood and we had a fab time.",Disneyland_Paris
144674589,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,We are great Disney fans and have been more than 10 times. We had a great break and still enjoy just walking around as much as going on the rides. The Disney Dreams spectacle at the end of the day is phenomenal   do not miss this. However some of the staff were not as friendly and customer focussed as we have experienced before and when we had a problem although it was resolved I did feel that it was my fault and that an excuse was made   not my previous experience of the Disney way,Disneyland_Paris
144657988,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Having had a brilliant time at Disney Orlando in August I was expecting to be disappointed with Paris. But no, of course it's colder, but we had a sunny October day the, drier than most of our days in Orlando.As for the park itself, main street is pretty much the same and still magical even when you've seen it before. There were a real mix of rides for all thrill levels. We only had one day in the park so we raced around trying to go on as much as possible. I think the fast pass process could be improved but it's the same in the US. On the down side.....The Europeans struggle to deliver that intense customer service experience and some of the staff were standing around and more interested in chatting with their colleagues than getting visitors onto rides, but others were brilliant. The only other disappointment was that the park closed early on Halloween and you had to buy a special ticket for the evening. Didn't realise this when we booked the tickets and would have gone on a different date if we had realised just because we only had the one day pass. I think there could be more done with the Disney Village. It is small and pretty much impossible to get a table at most of the restaurants unless you book before you go, especially if you want to go to the Wild West Show. Other restaurants such as Planet Hollywood don't take bookings but the queues can be very long if you don't time it well.Back to the positive....Loved Crush's Coaster and the stunt show. It was good that there was a mix of rides from the US as well as some different ones too. The laser show was pretty awesome. Will definitely go back.",Disneyland_Paris
144641156,4,2012-9,United Kingdom,We travelled to Disneyland Paris with our two young children aged 1 and 3. The journey from CDG airport is seamless and straightforward and you can be at the park in around 20 minutes. Having travelled to the US Los Angeles park we had a basis for comparison and the park is virtually the same in terms of the rides and the characters. The park is spotless and such a pleasure to walk around. We were concerned that with such young children they may not be able to go on that many rides but actually I would say the 3 year old went on 95% of the rides and the 1 year old about 90% and they both absolutely loved it. Seeing the characters was a highlight for my 3yo and he has not stopped talking about since. They probably won't remember much of it but seeing their faces and the enjoyment they got is something we will never forget. It is very expensive which you expect but with current exchange rates you feel the expense even more. I found food choice a little limiting we were fed up of the fast food options by day 2 and would have liked a bit more variety in the affordable range. For the convenience to the UK it was brilliant for a three day break and I would probably go again but I think when the kids are old I would save up for the real deal in the States.,Disneyland_Paris
144611580,4,2012-10,France,"If staying at a Disney hotel you get two extra hours access in the mornings but not all rides etc are open at this tlme so no real advantage. We found the cast members seemed to have more Disney spirit than in the Studio park. My daughter worked there 20 years ago when the park opened and she seemed to think the training was not so good, as they would say in those days 'c'est bad show'!",Disneyland_Paris
144603937,5,2012-5,New Zealand,"I once went to Disneyland in LA when I was a kid, I remember it as fun, but I also remember the 3 hour long queues to get on any rides.I surprised my Fiance with a trip to Euro Disney, he had absolutely no idea where we were headed when we left London on a train until we arrived at the Marne la Vallee train station and he saw the hot air balloon and some of the rides! Priceless reaction :o)We spent three days at both the Disneyland Park and the Walt Disney Studios Park   out of the two, I preferred Disneyland. It cost around    150 for tickets to both parks on all three days each and we bought the tickets from the hotel reception on day of arrival.Disneyland had all the usual rides and attractions you expected, like the teacups and it's a smallworld. Some rides I didn't expect like Space Mountain II, which was pretty cool since I went on the first Space Mountain back in LA 22 years ago! We are definitely roller coaster goers   and our favourite rides were:Space Mountain Mission 2Buzz Lightyear Laser BlastBig Thunder MountainIndiana Jones and the Temple of PerilBut apart from the rides, I think the Disneyland Park really has that Disney feel and atmosphere to it that the Walt Disney Studios doesn't seem to have. You do really feel like a kid again, and when you can use the Fast Passes to your best advantage, it's even better! We managed to get on all the big rides at least twice if not more.One thing I found dissappointing about the park was the lack of affordably priced healthier meals. The only meals we could find that were quick and not too overly priced were burgers, chicken nuggets and hotdogs. It's safe to say we were absolutely sick of all three by day three and looking forward to a good meal by the time we got home. We did try some of the restaurants but unfortunately we must have been hungry at the same time as everyone else because we couldn't find any without a long queue of people to be seated. We did find it easier to find more variety for food at the Disney Village outside of the park.We definitely couldn't have done both parks like we did (and Disney shopping!) in less than three days, but we were absolutely knackered by the third day.We were also very lucky to be there during their 20 year anniversary celebrations and got to see the light show on the Castle   which was absolutely spectactular, I've never actually seen anything like it   beats any of the fireworks hands down!!Had a wonderful time and will take a lot of great memories from the trip.",Disneyland_Paris
144601414,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,"We have just spent 5 days at disneyland paris and had the most fabulous time!! We stayed at the hotel cheyenne 2 adults and 2 children. We organised a private transfer to and from the airport with ezyshuttle and cannot recommend them enough, on time polite chauffeur.The hotel was good nice clean rooms but to be honest we literally just slept there and spent all our time in the parks. Breakfast was busy and same things everyday the usual fayre bread rolls, croissants, ham, cheese, fruit but was ok. There are shuttle buses running from the hotel to the park free of charge and they come almost every 5 mins we never had to wait for a bus.The parks are immaculately clean and beautifully decorated for halloween while we were there it was busy and we probably queued for approx 45 mins per ride but it was fine as they are very well organised and the queue is always moving so you don't feel as if you have waited so long plus most of the queues are indoors or undercover and there are usually things for the kids to look at while waiting. Noone pushed in the queues although you need to be quite quick when waiting to have photos taken with the characters. The staff were all very nice, polite and almost all of them spoke excellent english and if they didn't we were still able to get by!The food was all ok quality wise but all fast food so fed up with chips by the end of the week!!! I would avoid mcdonalds though it took us over an hour to be served so we didn't return. We visited most of the restaurants there such as planet hollywood, rainforest cafe, annettes diner and had no problems getting a table without reservations but we did eat early for lunch and dinner compared to others so probably missed the rush hours! The prices for food were slightly more than UK but probably on a par with theme parks here drinks and snacks in the park again were more than you would usually pay but we expected it to be really over the top after reading other reviews. As well as the rides the shows are definately worth going to see in the studios park and the end of the day show at the castle is not to be missed. We are saving our pennies to go back again as soon as possible!!!!",Disneyland_Paris

144576476,4,2012-9,United States,i am a big disney fan and this park is most like disneyland in california in size and scale then the magic kingdom in Florida. It is a very easy trip from Paris (RER train) and has all of the disney fqvorites available with a french flair. If it rains there is a covered walkway behind the mainstreet shops.,Disneyland_Paris

144571262,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"After reading some of the reviews on here I was worried that I would be disappointed with the whole Disney experience but thankfully I was not. We travelled at the end of the September by Euro star and stayed at the Sequoia Lodge for a 3 night 4 day break with 4 adults and 2 children (2 and 5) (see separate review). When we first entered Disneyland I felt a little overwhelmed by the size of the resort and thought that we would never cover everything but after a day in the park I realised that it would be manageable.I am not a smoker and was dreading the prospect of my children having to stand in smoke filled queues (as some of the reviews have stated) but we never experienced any of that. The queues were also reasonably short for most of the rides. We did try to use the Disney extra hrs but was never organised enough to get there much before 9.15 a.m.Favourite rides: Pirates, Buzz, It's a small world, Autopia, Big Thunder Mountain (5yr old didn't enjoy the last bit) Star Tours. My 2 year old daughter loved the Carrousel especially as she had to ride the horse alone (only one person per animal though the children are strapped on and you can stand by them).My Husband and my In laws went on the Space Mountain ride and looked like they needed therapy by the time they got off, so I   m glad that I didn't try that one! The children were not overly keen on the Pinocchio ride.Make sure you visit the less talked about bit's such as the Dragon under the castle (my children now believe that Dragon's exist after all) and the quirky Aladdin   s passage.On the first evening we went for early supper at the Steak Restaurant in Frontierland. My Daughter fell asleep in the restaurant so whilst the others sat and relaxed I took my son aged 5 off to explore the park. By this time it was about 6pm and getting quite dark, Frontierland was really quiet we explored this park then went into Adventureland as they sort of merge together. We explored the caves in the dark and visited the tree house. We saw about three other people which made it really special and almost felt like it was for real and not in a Disney theme park!Highlight of the Holiday was Disney Magic, DO NOT MISS THIS SHOW! Even if it's pouring with rain (it did twice with us) it is still essential that you stand and watch. I would say that the cost of the holiday was worth it just to see that show and we watched it every evening. The first night we arrived an hr before hand then between 30 min to 5 minutes each night after that. Watched it from different angles but preferred the show from the front central view by the white rope (if that makes sense).For me the negatives of Disney were that the toilets are not that clean, and a few of the restaurants were closed as they were lot's of buisiness meetings conferences taking place whilst we were there. But overall I thought that the park was clean and fresh looking and not the tired drab place that I was sort of expecting. The staff were also friendly and helpful too. Also not as expensive as I thought it would be, we used the meal vouchers and spent 200 euros whilst we were there and 100 of that was spent in the gift shops on the last day. I cannot wait to go again, Thank you Disney!!.Tips: Plan, plan, plan. Take lot's of dressing up outfits my children never wore non fancy dress for the entire holiday and a Disney Dress to buy thre is 70 Euros plus! Take a buggy and a bike lock, I took food with us and sandwich bags, there are water fountains in the park. My children were too tired to eat breakfast so I use to take ham and cheese from the restaurant and make filled wraps for lunch. I also made Disney autograph books before I went, I used good quality small ring bounded sketch books, then decorated them with Disney motifs. These are now filled with autographs from the park and photos of my children with the characters. Visit Mickeys cafe (see seperate review).",Disneyland_Paris

144514558,4,2012-1,Australia,But still worthy of a visit and we all had a great time. I must admit that we went on a weekday in January when the European children were at school so didn't have to hardly queue for any of the rides. We were staying in Paris and got the train to Disney....it was so easy to do and it drops you right outside the gates. We got there as soon as it opened and had a plan to go to the most popular rides first and then visit the rides that don't get as busy. Our girls loved it and it was the highlight of their holiday. It doesn't have the same magic as Florida but it is still Disney and a lot of fun. The food was quite expensive but we only ate lunch there and opted for a hotdog and chips which wasn't fantastic but we weren't there for the food any way.The parade was great at the end of the day although it had started to rain when we were there.,Disneyland_Paris
144495909,1,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Really disappointing. A real surprise that it was so bad: poor on any absoilute scale and utterly shocking that Disney of all companies would tolerate such appalling standards.When we went to Disney in USA I was blown away by the professionalism & dedication to detail: friendly, clean, efficient   a lesson to people to learn from. None of that showed here, and it is a lesson only in the sense of things to avoid.Admittedly, it was half term & busy, it was a cold & rainy day, but still, that was a test   a test EuroDisney utterly, utterly failed.1) Lines for rides were very long. 1 2 hours. OK, so it happens but.....Disney is famous for its management of expectations: you see a clock saying  70 minutes wait  and I know this, so I think  60 minutes . When it is nearer 100 minutes I am staggered: not only by the actual wait but that expectation management has gone s o o o wrong.2) This is why they have FASTPASS. But the machines didn't work.Specificaly, they couldn't read the bar codes from online tickets.Long, long lines, and one poor cast member running around doing it by hand...3) Which was a consistent theme.Everywhere was understaffed. Long lines, long waits, harrassed staff.Awful.4) Some of the rides were broken. There are not *that* many so if one of the big rides ( Rock & Roller Coaster ) closes, that spills over.5) The food was *DIRE*. This is Paris: you have to search out bad food, but  boy  Disney managed it!!Waiting 40 minutes for an expensive plate of sub KFC fast food...Inedible, disgusting. Even our kids (who normally eat everything and who have mno problems with fast food were not impressed. I found it literally indeible).6) It is eye wateringly expensive.    9 for a tub of bad popcorn, incredibly expensive fast food.7) Where were the cast (1) ?The rides & concessions were understaffed, but where were the  helpers ? I don't think I saw a cast member.Again, in USA I remember being overwhemled by how many, how helpful people. Not a soul...8) Where were the cast (2) ?Where was Mickey, Buzz, Princesses, etc etc etc.Several small children were asking puzzled: they'd been promised to see them   but no one....9) Not to mention no parade, no fireworks...Paradoxical because it was Guy Fawkes w end in UK but nothing.10) Had anyone from Disney noticed they were in Paris, not in CA or FL?Has no one mentioned this in 20 years?It was cold & rainy.But that is not a surprise: the city has the same weather most years & it will rain. So plan ahead....Building a shelter to protect people as they wait in line for 2 hours is not that had: the concept of  a roof  has been known to architects for several thousand years.There were precious few places to shelter from the rain, and even fewer where you could warm up    all imppossibly crowded.The lines were cold & with rain pouring downIf this were  No Name Theme Park  I would have thought it was rubbish, serves us right for going, but what do you expect....But from Disney? Disney !!?? The company famous for professionalism, dedication to detail, micro management...???I don't own shares but if I did I would sell: this is a sign of a company that has majorly lost the plot.In the mean time, there are better theme parks in Europe (or maybe as bad, but cheaper & with lower expectations)   or save up and go to CA or FL.",Disneyland_Paris
144494477,5,2012-11,United States,"So living near the California Disneyland, I wanted to compare it to the Paris one. It is close to central Paris, about 30 minutes from Paris by taking the RER train A. It was a great park. Similar to the one in Anaheim with little changes here and there. Also, there are some rides not in California such As the Aerosmith coaster. I would recommend it if you have time while in PRis",Disneyland_Paris
144489339,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Our trip to Disneland Paris for Halloween did not disappoint . We went through the day and purchased the night ticket for the not so scary halloween party. Dressed in our disney costumes for the evening we had so much fun. I think next time we will just purchase the night time ticket as the park didn't seem as busy as it had been thought the day, getting on the rides was not such long waits in the evening. The shows that we're put on just for halloween were fabulous. The disney parade and dreams is something to see.Food and drink in the park is well over priced, the park in comparison to Florida just doesn't compare in friendliness of staff or cleanliness , I think they could do and should do better considering its disney and the premium we all pay to be there we expect things to be better .

144480006,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Well Done Disneyland! Our children had a fantastic time at the park! The queues in this park moved extremely quickly (we waited no more than 45 mins for each BIG ride) We ate at The Lucky Nugget and enjoyed the different sort of atmosphere (i wont spoil it!)However, we did encounter a few problems. We found some of the Disneyland staff very rude at times especially when we would ask why a ride was not open to be told  not working can't you see !We also found the parades generally stopped the ease of being able to walk around the park. Our youngest daughter is 9 and after seeing the 1st parade they were not interested in seeing it again however, at least 15 20 mins before it would start they would make people stand along the road edges and stop people being able to walk through causing chaos in certain areas, we nearly lost our children a few times due to people pushing and shoving!Overall, we will visit again for convinence but this park still has a lot to learn from Florida.",Disneyland_Paris

144444176,3,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Firstly let me say that I love Disney, but having just returned from a 4 day visit, over halloween, I was quite disappointed with a number of things. We stayed in a Disney Hotel to make use of the extra hours (Disney Hotel guests are allowed access into the park between 8 & 10am, before the general public), we felt that as the park becomes so busy, this would be a crucial time to cram in lots of rides. How wrong we were! Disney Studios does not open until 10am, so we went straight to the main park, once inside we soon discovered that Frontierland and Adventureland do not open until 10am, Leaving just Discoveryland and Fantasyland open, and of those only half of the rides were available before 10am (no rollercoasters). Leaving the few available rides with ridiculously long queues. To be frank it was hideous. By day 2 the so called advantage of extra hours faded into insignificance and we found ourselves aimlessly wandering round. People started queueing at 9.30 for rides that were due to open at 10am, which we found ourselves doing to stand any chance of getting on before the gates opened. The second annoying thing was the amount of people in the park, I do not know of the parks health and safety policies, but there seemed to be far to many people in the park (this was our 3rd visit and it seemed dramatically busier), queueing was a very uncomfortable, lenghly experience. With people insisting on trying to push in and smoking whilst waiting. Not nice when you have 2 young children with you. I would recommend that if you were planning to book a Disney hotel on the basis of the extra hours   don't bother. Also we stayed at Santa Fe (which we found more than satisfactory) which has an esso garage behind, where you can go to stock up on supplies, much cheaper than in the park. They do sell alcohol between the hours of 8am and 6pm, where you can get a bottle of wine for about 5 euros!",Disneyland_Paris
144397790,5,2012-10,Ireland,"loved the park,was a very busy time but we still managed to get to try all the rides and attractions,hated the queues lost a lot of time but still had a ball.",Disneyland_Paris
144394794,1,2012-11,France,"I took my son to Disneyland Paris two days ago. I wanted to have a special mother son day, and in his eyes, we probably did. BUT for such a highly reputed theme park, I have a hard time believing the good reviews. I've been living in France for 9 years and I fully understand that it is VERY hard to train French people about the hospitality industry, what the difference is between good service and bad. But the workers for the most part were unhappy in their own lives (maybe can't blame them if they're working at Disney), and not afraid to show it. I would like to think Disney has the means to train employees on being friendly, or even how to fake being friendly.That said   there is a system called  Fast Pass,  which did eliminate some of the queing time. But it was quite inefficient and had some restrictions. Inefficient because they would tell you to come back between 2   5 hours!! And you couldn't use it for more than 1 or 2 rides at a time. Now the biggest disappoinment to me was the FOOD. Never in my life, even from my simple grocer cheap discount food, have I had such terrible, awful food. The exception was the popcorn and candy apples. Every restaurant offered the same  American  fare, that was so flavorless that stating it  left a lot to be desired  would be a severe understatement. I am not a 5 star luxury diner and not someone who has the highest expectations either. I am a regular lower middle class person. But I would not be surprised AT ALL if the food they serve you comes from the same factory that prepares DOG FOOD. And maybe it's even below that. I mean really, Disney, how do you get away with that? OMG, my son loves  Ribs  and when we went to the  Western  style restaurant and he ordered ribs I thought he was being picky until I cut into them and tasted them. First of all, 90% of the  ribs  were blubber layered over a bone. What little meat there was, tasted like boiled mush   literally. They are serving premade microwave meals and I can tell you, with all honesty, that they are as low of quality as you can find. But you will pay a premium price for it. I am ready to write to Disney myself about this matter, because I would think a corporation with such a reputation would want to please their guests. However, this was just beyond disappointing. It was just flat out disgusting. Keep in mind, I am NOT a picky person!!! We also had a hotdog that tasted as if it were boiled beyond oblivion. I mean really, how hard is it to make a simple hotdog. I can do that myself with the cheapest hot dogs from the grocery store and it will taste better. I realize some people are just of a complaining nature and nothing is ever good enough. But this is why you should listen to my review, because I am not one of these. This is why I am writing this, because I really think you should read my warning, and I hope the people at Disney have a look at these reviews every once in a while too.In addition, I'm sorry, but there were a number of E. European guests who lack what W. Europeans would call manners. And then you have the French teenie boppers who are in heat in line behind you about to have sex while waiting. No discretion for public displays of affection.The Buzz Lightyear ride did have technical probs. And so did Indiana Jones, after we waited for 45 min. in line (posted waiting time was 30 min), then they told us it would be at least another 30 min and we left. It is just very, very tiresome to walk around with these huge crowds and stand in line for so many hours. I would suggest that Disney 1. outsources food services if they're incapable of delivering anything decent. 2. Set a maximum capacity for the park so that it isn't overcrowded and the guests can enjoy it.One last bad point   You know Paris has the same weather as London, right? Well you probably don't. I didn't. Now that I've been living here for 9 years, I can assure you that they might have 10% less rain, but that's it. It rains here nonstop. And it's very cold most of the year. You might have a 1 month window of good weather. But I'm sure the crowds during this period are intolerable. So I would just suggest avoiding this park at all costs. You would probably have a better time at one of the real Disney parks in the US if you can manage to save up enough to get over there.Hope this helped",Disneyland_Paris
144386400,3,2012-10,United Kingdom,"We booked for the Halloween party with very little information on the website before we went, it was difficult to research what the   30 per person was going to give us for our money.Following the trip it was very disappointing compared to America Disney it was LAZY !!!!! Not alot of trick or treats very mean with the sweets.Poor parade and not alot of spookey goings on.The visitors in fancy dress were far more interesting to watch and very few characters were in the park.The end to the poor evening was the fireworks and light show which was good was ruined for two families the lady next to me who fell head first down some steps due to very poor lighting and my own family while i attended her injuries, my children formed a human barrier to stop the poor woman being trodden on ! Staff did not seem to have great first aid knowledge and she was moved walked up steps and put in a wheelchair just hope she had no broken bones.As i always try and think of one positive it would be the fact we saved on the cost of fast pass and at a very busy time managed to get on more rides with the children.",Disneyland_Paris
144367539,3,2012-10,United Kingdom,This is the busy side. Very busy at weekends or school holidays.  Some decent rides but overall more for the smaller kids.  Queues can be quite horrific and don't trust the minutes to queue signs!  The shows on the castle are spectacular!,Disneyland_Paris
144362056,3,2012-10,Canada,"We went to Disney Paris for their Halloween Party and found it very frustrating. We love Disney back home but Paris Disney is dirty and not well organized. The smoking all over the park in large crowds and even in lines are almost dangerous as the kids rush by to try to get to the rides. The lines are not well managed and people jump the queues and cut off the children trying to get on the rides. Space mountain, mission 2 is awesome and there are some more exciting rides at the park. Fantasy land is there with many traditional rides and there are many new rides in Disney Studios. There are characters to meet and greet and the kids enjoyed their day. The Halloween Party was horrible with no space to move and very few little kids in the park.",Disneyland_Paris

It still has a lot of the same features as the Florida park such as the Rockin Roller coaster, the Tower of Terror, Animal Kingdom etc. The food can be very expensive in Disney and we find a lot of the tourists who do not speak English can be very rude towards you. Apart from that it is honestly wonderful! We are hoping to go back next year!",Disneyland_Paris

144265092,4,2012-9,United States,"The park is celebrating it's 20th anniversary this year. The fireworks show at the end of the evening is worth the entry alone. The park is not as developed as the US parks so I had a pretty easy time getting almost everything done in one day going into both parks, but the parks were not busy at all either. Alice's Curious Labyrinth is unique to this park and it is one of my highlights. And Space Mountain 2.0 is very different from the US Parks as it goes upside down.Characters are difficult to take photos with as they all get mobbed with no such thing as a line. That was disappointing.Taking the train from central Paris took about a little less than an hour for those who want to know.",Disneyland_Paris

144218308,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,"We traveled to Disneyland Paris on our second last day in Paris. The weather was on and off but mostly overcast which didn't dampen our enthusiasm. However, with any theme park comes long, winding and everlasting queues. At one point we waited 90 minutes and more for a single ride. To be fair it was the day before Halloween but it was a Monday and we expected it to be a little quieter than what we experienced. All in all the park is brilliant, great for the kids but you will need more than one day here to experience it all and have fun at the same time. Crushers coaster in the toon studios was a great ride, I think it is the newest to the park! All the classics are still there too, Thunder mountain, Space Mission 2, indianna Jones and Aerosmith. Sadly because of these long queues we only managed to get on 5 major attractions once. If we were to return again we would fork out for the Fast Passes. Especially when you pay a large sum for a ticket, you would expect to get on as many rides as you possibly could. One major pro off our trip was the new laser and firework disney dreams show which was amazing! It was on at 10pm and that was the highlight of our trip! Ps go for the full day 9am   10pm.",Disneyland_Paris
144214225,3,2012-10,United Kingdom,"We visited for four days over the Halloween break, where the park was plainly over crowded. We travelled by rail, and stayed outside the park, which was a considerable saving. The longest we ever waited for a train was about 5 minutes, which is more than can be said for the shuttle buses.We stayed in the Val d'Europe area, where there are some good and reasonably priced restaurants, a huge shopping centre, and local shops. On the train, this is literally 3 minutes from the Disney station.We found long queues for all the rides, with the fast pass options running out very early in the day. The tickets are very expensive, and its hard to see real value for money. The number of shops easily outnumber the rides.",Disneyland_Paris
144212596,1,2012-10,France,"Not impressed. Where to start: we had to pay the same price for children as adults (what a ripoff). Had to pay AGAIN to park   15 euros, you'd think the high cos of admission would include this. None of the restaurants accept ticket restaurants, and the food was very poor quality though super expensive. Hugely long queues though perhaps this was to be expected on a weekend in school hols. Ride kept stopping on Buzz Lightyear. Tech problems with Indiana Jones ride also, so had to wait an extra 30 minutes. Didn't have the option to leave the queue either. My daughter waited 40 mins to buy candyfloss   no idea why, the queue wasn't v long   think maybe the vendor had gone off to watch the Parade but didn't tell the customers! And as you had to buy a token elsewhere, if you left the queue you lost your money! Discoveryland was v tatty. Sooo, I certainly wouldn't recommend a trip to Disneyland unless you WANT to see an example of a greedy conglomerate in action.",Disneyland_Paris
144204279,5,2012-10,United Arab Emirates,"Wonderful experience at both, the park and the studio. More than the rides, I was impressed with the whole festive concept and also the way it has been designed. 1 day is definitely not enough as the park is divided into 5 zones and could not cover it totally. The studio has few rides and movie experiences which were really nice. Overall, a nice place to be but please ensure to spend at least 2 days.",Disneyland_Paris

We still had to wait 25 mins to get on a ride later on with an FP, which isn't very 'fast'. Disney should use bar codes on their day tickets from the booths (like the tickets bought online) rather than mag stripes, as the latter cause a good proportion of the delay in obtaining an FP, with people having trouble getting the flimsy cards read.Dreams show was a highlight, bit of a scrum to get out after so if you've got young'uns hold onto them !",Disneyland_Paris

144091709,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,"As a newer version of the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, this park is beautifully designed and is by far the prettiest. The only thing that spoils it is the Europeans smoking in the queues. It's a shame Disney make no attempt to ban this behaviour.There are a couple of attractions that would benefit from an update (Pirates of the Carribean and Star Tours for example), but otherwise, it's a beautiful park. The new Disney Dreams show is phenomenal.",Disneyland_Paris

The queue's for most rides weren't too long but if you have a fastpass that isn't a problem anyway.Although the Peter Pan ride did have technical difficulties on one of the days and we were waiting in the quite for around 50 minutes, this was on one of the particularly cold days which made it worse...luckily it's worth the wait.The Small World ride was closed on two of the days for maintenance, so on the day it did re open the queue's were ridiculously long all day, this put us off going on as all the other rides had ques that were less.The whole park really makes you feel child like and especially when you go into Sleeping Beauty's castle you really like you are in a fairy tale...which is the whole point.All in all, amazing. I cant wait to go back again!I have only 1 negative comment; some of the employee's of the park and I literally mean a very small portion of them   mostly they working in the shops, seemed lacking in customer service or even happiness, some were quite abrupt and did not seem to grasp that even they have an influence on the whole of people's experiences and it seemed like just a job to them.

144025271,4,2012-10,United States,"EuroDisney is just like the Disney in the States...except that its in France. Don't get me wrong, the place looks and feels just like the ones in the States. It's easy to export mechanical stuff. What doesn't translate so well is the French  work ethic  or the lack thereof. People go to an amusement park to be amused. They understand that they'll pay higher prices but they have hopes of forging wonderful memories with the kids. That's hard to do sometimes when the employees clearly look at this as a job and not an adventure. A lot of the employees are very good but some, and they always seem to be in places designed to be noticed, simply don't seem to get it. Everything is just a little harder because they don't have the American  customer is king  approach and prefer the  if I ignore you, you will go away and my job is safe because we are the only game in this town.  It's is primarily true in anything involving customer services   restaurants or sales points. The cast members who dance around or work the rides are ally pretty good. Maybe a bad attitude is required to sell popcorn. If you go, don't expect happy, smiling kids grateful for a job in hard economic times. Maybe they should hire people from Spain.",Disneyland_Paris

143933644,4,2012-10,United States,"So, a year went by, and the pain of Disneyland Paris 2011 was a distant memory (see previous review). So, we booked to go again for our sons 4th birthday. We were tempted by both time and money to try again ...... & I am glad we did. Our first visit was a little shock to the system, being frequent Disney USA travellers. Disney is Disney ... but the French will ever be American!!We travelled during the half term break in October and there are good points and bad points from our experience last year;Good points:1. The queues were not as long for food or the rides (although Peter Pan was never really below the 45 minute mark);2. Themed for Halloween, which made it a little more special (we liked playing spot the pumpkin);3. Although a no smoking park   some nationalities are still not used to being told when and where to smoke ... but this was without doubt, more controlled than last year;4. The new layout of the Disney Village (1 security check) was far better;Bad points:1. Parts of the park are closed for half of the week (being  out of season ); Small World, Caseys Train and Fairytale Boat ride were closed from Tuesday through to Friday ... if we knew this, we would have made more of this area before the end of Monday ... there should be more awareness around closure of rides!;2. The rides that should have been open for disney hotel guests who benefit from extra disney hours were not open when we went ... Snow White & Pinocchio were closed, and Buzz, Peter Pan were broken ... which left only 3 rides open during the 2 extra hours ... and you guessed it the Queue's for those were long! 3. Toilets were better cleaned, although those near Peter Pan are still awful (and we went in two sets of different womens toilets and found men in there (odd)!On the day of our little boys birthday, we were advised to go to City Hall and inform them that it was his birthday. He was treated to a personal call from Mickey, and a birthday gift of wither a Traders Pin, Balloon or an Autograph Book ... what a special thing to do!Prices are controlled, (still disney prices) but not really any higher than last year!All in all a good break and being back a day ... we are already planning Christmas at Disney for 2013!",Disneyland_Paris

I could not get over how clean the parks were and how friendly the staff are, and Main Street is so pretty.The Small World ride was lovely and the Phantom Manor in Frontierland was very good. Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast is worth a visit. In the Disney Studios Park you must go on the Studio Tram Tour it is very very good.Cine Magique is brilliant as is Animagique for the little visitors . We also went to see Stunt show Spectacular which was amazing if not a little noisy but it is worth a look.

It is difficult to decide which our favourite ride was.. Pirates of the Caribbean? Buzz's Remote Control Car? Star Tours (a personal favourite), Tower of Terror? Toy soldier Parachute Drop? Thunder Mountain? and many more. We were a little disappointed by the fact that the Disney characters were not particularly in evidence. Also a couple of broken rides meant that our very first ride of the visit (Pirates of The Caribbean) had to be abandoned, though we went on it four times later. Also we were unable to re visit Buzz's alien blaster ride. On day two, despite the fact that it was a busier day, it seemed that a lot more food outlets were closed.

The parades were wonderful and the firework display on the castle was superb. Just make sure you find your spot early. To get the best autographs and photos instead of having to push when they appear in the park book into Mickeys cafe for breakfast, lunch or dinner where 5 different characters came in and were happy to pose and sign.

143677221,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Disney guide,Getting there, eating, trains,rides, queue and fastpass. Please click more to read all the article.I had a two day pass, which I purchased on line. It's available on the day but the on line voucher was 93 pound where as buying from Disney on the day it cost 131 euros. if you're can get a voucher pre hand you'll save money.With the voucher all you have to do is take it to the counters that are selling tickets to redeem for your Disney ticket, job done.Getting thereWe stayed at val de Europe which was one stop away on the RER train line, it took about 3 mins by this train. If you do stay in the Val de Europe area, don't use the local bus as this will take you around the whole Val de Europe village taking around 30 minutes.TIP,,,, if you buy train tickets, we asked about return tickets like you buy in England, they didn't offer this system, you just buy two tickets, one for the outward bound journey, one for the return.Important when you start you train journey don't enter the platform through an open gate, you ticket will not work when you try to leave the platform the other end of your journey, by running your ticket through the machine when you enter the platform you validate your ticket, the machines at the other end recognise a validated ticket, it won't recognise your ticket and you'll have problems getting out..EatingLots to choose from on the park, But there is a avenue of restaurants including Planet Hollywood, Starbucks, McDonalds and many more, if you want something a little more adventurous such as Italian, Chinese, you can come off the site get on a train to val de Europe it will take you 5mins by train and choose from a number of restaurant's and there's a lovely shopping centre there, including a huge French supermarket Auchan that sells everything from lobster to paracetamol . Hot slices of pizza, panini's, huge fruit and veg area, fresh bread you can get almost everything from this supermarket. What you can't get from there you'll get from the rest of the shops. Designer clothes, games, hardware even a dry cleanersThere's also a Sea world.Disneyworld the parkWell on arriving you have to redeem your voucher this can be done at any of the ticket kiosk.Once through the gates you are met by the Main Street area this includes plenty of Disney shops and restaurants.The Disney trainIt's goes around the perimeter of the the park giving in you an over view on the park.TIP,,, get on at the main entrance, there are four other entrances but we found that at the other stops nobody was getting of as they got on at the main entrance and travelled all the way round.The way it works is, people off people on, so If nobody gets off nobody can get on and if all got on at the main entrance they tend to get off there.Fast pass and queuingThere's signs above the entry point of each ride telling how long you will wait from certain points,these are very accurate.There's a free service called fast pass, which is great. This is how it works, near each ride there will be a collection of four five machines which normally have attends close by. If you can't find he machines ask the Disney attendants at the main entrance to the ride you want to get on.You run your main Disney ticket through a fast pass machine it will give you another ticket with a time on it, these are normally 30min, say from 12:35 13:10 and that is the time you can enter the ride. The time slot is normally displayed above the fast pass machines. Don't worry If you don't make it back. You can get another fast pass ticket after the time slot on you original fast pass ticket has passed. This system only run up until certain time always check when the fast pass system stops.This will save you load of time queuing. I queued for 40mins on the Temple of Doom through normally queue system.The next day I got a fast pass ticket for mountain roller coaster, I got the ticket at 10:39, my slot was 12:30 13:10 so away I went for another ride came back there was a 40min wait in the normal queue, I went throughout the fast past queue, 8mins later I was on the ride, whoopieeeee.The showsIn the leaflets you get when you by your tickets, you'll find times for when all the shows are on.We caught the big parade which came around at 17:00 this was great and had all the main characters from Disney on it.There are also bands playing at certain times on the stages scattered around the parks this happens at certain time, check the time tables. The Disneyland characters make appearance around the park again check the time tables this will tell you when and where they will be..The night showIf Disney could be more magical.The night certainly hit all the right buttons, Disneyland Paris is twice as magical.Castles and building were all illuminated, bands playing it was great, there is a celebration at 10:00 or 9:00 check times, I think 9:00 is Sunday.It's not just fireworks......There's a animations Display projected onto the castle based on Peter Pan, Including many Disney characters, there's lasers, fire blast and fireworks.The crowds are not for the faint hearted though, everybody's wants their bit of Disney magic. Putting this aside it was spectacular, get a good place though, I got there around 20:30 and loads of people where already there in prime position.We stayed at the Relais SPA Val D'Europe the hotel was booked through Easy click, it cost 210 for three nights, the hotel it self was well fitted, nice and clean, positioned on the outside of the village. 2 5 walking distance from the restaurant and shopping centre.The room was superb, very clean and plenty of room.Went through the main door into the room and found a galley style kitchen microwave, fridge and dishwasher. There were two doors, one into the bedroom the other into the bathroom.The bedroom was spacious the bed was very comfy, nice fixtures and fitting. Nice size bedroom and bathroom.Room all round very spacious, clean. Helpfull staff, a taxi cost 100euros.I would diffidently use this hotel again..ps it was a Great...",Disneyland_Paris
143674961,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Just wanted to write a review based on our recent visit. Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Definately! Everything was so smooth, the booking through WorldTravellers.com, the Eurostar, Disney Express, hotel and park, everything was absolutely fantastic. As I said we booked through Worldtravellers and nothing seemed to be too much trouble. They answered any questions I had and made the whole booking really easy and always kept me well informed. I especially wanted to mention them as there doesn't seem to be any reviews, good or bad. about this company. I Iike to check other peoples experience before I pass over my hard earned cash to someone over the phone.We stayed at the Santa Fe, which was basic but gave us what we needed. The rooms and linen were clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful. A great base, I don't really see the point in paying more for a hotel when you are really only there for a very short time.I can't praise Disneyland enough, we went Sunday to Wednesday, the week before half term and although there were a lot of people on the park we were able to go on everything we wanted to and see some of the shows. The longest we really waited for a ride was about 45 minutes, but mostly the waiting times were fairly short. Try to head for a popular ride when the parade or a show is on and take advantage of the extra hours opening times if staying on the resort.This has got to be the best break we have been on and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.",Disneyland_Paris

There was a lack of staff present as you see in Disneyworld...usually you see cast crew walking around smiling, a random street performance, characters walking around..not here. There was smoke everywhere! Yes, this is France, but it's also Disneyland. The rule of  no smoking other than in designated areas  was not enforced and people even smoked whilst in the queue! The studios only has 3 fast pass rides and one of them being a small kiddie ride, the other for a ride for over 1.2m. There should be a FP for the Crush ride or RC rider. The crush ride was posted as 60 min wait but in reality it was 90! The rides were riddled with technical difficulties, throwing us for a loop when we'd come back for our FP time slot and the ride was closed.

That is twice on my credit card, once on my debit card and once on my wife's card. Disney is now responsible for tying up all of my available finance, all of my credit card limit and most of my current account over   5000 for a weekend break. I still don't have a booking. Their excuse,  if your bank doesn't approve the transaction immediately we don   t progress the booking . As far as I can tell the bank did process the transactions immediately. The bank have given me a payment reference number for each of the payment saying that Disney had to cancel them, when I contacted them they said that they couldn   t do this as there was no booking and that the transaction would cancel itself in 5 or six days. I can't access my funds for a week because of their system and they don't care. THE MAGIC ENDS HERE!",Disneyland_Paris
143587874,5,2012-3,United Kingdom,"As wonderful as we expected, So much to do. Spent everyday out in the parks and restaurants and every night totally exhausted but looking forward to the next day. The parks ultimately cater for the children but all of the adults had such a good time as well. Went to see Bill's Wild West Show (on site) , which was absolutely brilliant. Plenty of choice for food. Lots of walking and Queuing but worth it. The holiday was completely enjoyed by 3 generations of the family and would I definately recommend a visit wheher as a couple, or for a fun family holiday.We stayed on site in one of the many hotels, we think this made the holiday so much better as no travelling was involved. You definately need at least a couple of days to see everything and to make sure you get great value for money. The parks are open from early to late but there is so much to see and do, it would be impossible to get around everything properly in just one day.",Disneyland_Paris
143577503,5,2011-11,India,"Carry water,eatables, wear light shoes and be ready to walk 6 8 km. Its better to wear light cloths and have the MAP before hand,narrow down your choices to few rides and better to avoid weekends.",Disneyland_Paris

143521522,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Well my wife and I visted in October 2012 for a day(2 parcs) and the only real complaint I have is the prices, everything is expensive. Using the fast track system is good and is a must to do on the good rides(as waiting time can be 60mins) Some of the better eating places you can book for lunch, this I would recomend as at busy times it's hard to find somewhere.If you can't get to USA then this is better than the UK based parks because its Disney, and we all love at least one character. Something you just have to do in your life! This is our third visit.",Disneyland_Paris
143512258,4,2012-10,France,"Visited in October 2012 with my husband and 4 year old. I think after 20 years its generally holding up well but could do a lot better in the following; toilet facilities in the restaurants and general park areas are not that clean and really need attendants with more regular servicing   disappointing. Food   at peak times midday and 7.30 8.00 pm the queues are out the doors and this is off season mid October so I dread to think what its like in July & August, more seated restaurant and takeaways with seated picnic areas are needed. Disney Paris need to up their game in terms of crowd control on the character appearances with cordonned off queuing as its just a free for all with ittle kids pushed all over the place and it can't be great for the characters either. Apart from these points though there is still plenty magic, on arrival the sight of Sleeping Beauty's castle just beyond Main St USA is wonderful, and the staging of each of the 4 lands looks great. Particular highlights for us were the dragon's cavern under the castle, Skull Rock and Captain Hook's pirate ship, everything in Fantasyland, Buzz Lightyears Laser Blast and of course the Disney shows. Mickey's Hallowe'en Treat in the Street show was very entertaining for younger kids and the Disney Dreams show at park closing (projected onto the Sleeping Beauty castle) is worth the entry price alone   its spectacular. One good thing thats new is in Fantasyland the theatre where you meet Mickey Mouse, the queuing system is genius you walk through a kind of cinema and there are mickey cartoons playing constantly and its the only queue that was a pleasure to be in as the kids were pre occupied with the cartoons, they should introduce this where they can in other attractions, its sure saves frayed nerves! Be sure to pick up a copy of the weekly events guide on arrival as this details the daily shows and character appearances, which are not listed on the general park map. I think there's enough to do in this park for 2 days max, although we did what we wanted in 1 (as quite a few of the attractions do not suit younger kids). But I would never visit in high season, its crazy enough with queues in mid October.",Disneyland_Paris
143482813,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,Travelled with my 10 year old daughter to disney   she loved it.  Great closing ceremony on the Saturday night.  Rides for all ages and if you do not like the rides plenty of shopping   characters to meet.,Disneyland_Paris
143475404,1,2012-10,United Kingdom,"I was expecting for a theme park for children and adults, i found one toliet in each area, which is not great when you have kids wanting to go to the toliet. There were also hardly any shelter for push chairs and prams, when it was raining during rides etc.There was hardly any characters walking around the park, I know we may of gone out of season but this theme park is open all year round and there should not be a difference in staff rates depending on season.I found the disney village the worst place for kids, Each resturant would not accomadate for families with prams. out of 10 places to eat in the village,there was only two resturants that had a downstairs area. one resturant was a pre book only and the other, we were told we couldn't eat downstairs.I found the disney village staff very rude and not helpful at all.The parks had some good rides but be prepared to do a lot of reading from screens as most rides had french commentry and no english was repeated.Also read carefully all maps and show information as most live shows were in english but they were not indicated properly on the maps or at the live showing areas.",Disneyland_Paris
143474787,5,2012-10,United States,"We spent one full Saturday at Disney Paris with family (kids 4 and 6, parents mom 7 months pregnant, and grandparents) and had a great, great visit. Our six year old is autistic and travel and vacation can really be tough. I frankly thought such a trip might be impossible. I am so very glad I was wrong. We bought tickets online for 4 of the 6 family members before arriving. Upon arrival, we inquired at the ticket window as to where we may purchase a special needs ticket for our son and for dad who was to be his designated 'carer'. We were directed to a special window at which we presented a letter from our doctor explaining his diagnosis (it was short and I worried it wouldn't be sufficient, but it was). The staff made a copy and sold us a discounted ticket for our son (59 euros for 2 parks 1 day) and a free ticket for dad, his 'carer'.We entered the park and stopped at City Hall, right on the left of the main square. There we showed the letters (the one for our son, and one from our doctor mentioning that I was pregnant) and they issued two different access cards, one for mom and one for son. We used these access passes by entering attractions at the exit or handicap entrances  we usually only used them for the kids and us parents, but when we asked at the Disney train station, they let all six of us go together. With them, we were able to get on the rides without waiting in the main line. The access cards made the visit do able and we'll never forget the experience.A note on food  we wanted to bring snacks as our son can be calmed in rough spots with a snack and because he has a number of allergies. We had read on various message boards that bag checkers confiscated food at the entrance, so we brought very little (and tucked away in pockets). Upon entrance, our bags were put through xray machines, but not searched. The folks in front of us had their bags searched because of bottles of liquid they were bringing in. They were allowed to bring their water, but a mini bottle of wine was confiscated. We saw other families that entered with bags of chips, etc in their packs. Ultimately, between the snacks we packed and the many options (including allergy free at some locations) we found enough for everyone to eat. We really enjoyed the Plaza Gardens buffet for a big, late lunch. It was pricey (13 euros for kids, 25 euros for adults) but ended up being our one big meal of the day. Good food and selection and the chefs were behind the buffet and willing to field questions on ingredients, etc.)",Disneyland_Paris

143401891,4,2012-10,Canada,"We were all adults in our group and we all had a fun time. Having been to the Disney parks in Florida and California, this one seemed smaller, yet there are lots to do and see. The free park maps available make it easy to find your way around and plan your day.The Walt Disney Studios are smaller than the Disneyland Park and there are fewer attractions, yet the fee to see them is the same. Disneyland was beautifully decorated with the yellow colors of Fall. Going on a weekday in October, the queues were not long and we were able to see all major attractions. Highlights: Big Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones, the Aerosmith Ride. Space Mountain is also a thrill, but the constant bumping of your head against the headrest makes it less enjoyable. We didn't have this problem on the Aerosmith ride. Food is expensive, about 15 euros for a burger with fries, but tasty. Service is slow, even in the fast foods. Bathrooms were relatively clean, yet smelly. The Disney Dreams show is absolutely fantastic. It is amazing what they can do with a few colored lights and some fireworks. Attractions in Fantasyland around Cinderella   s Castle close early in preparation for the show, about 60 90 minutes before the start of the show.",Disneyland_Paris

Toilets leave a lot to be desired and I know they are well used but they need to clean up more often! The food is really expensive and not great unless you like chips and reformed chicken and meat. Maybe the bigger restaurants are better for quality food but which family can afford 30 euros plus for a meal? Never thought I'd be glad to see a Macdonalds!! Our visit to Cafe Mickey was memorable for 2 things   the characters were wonderful and the food was extortionate and pretty awful, such a disappointment really but the children had a wonderful time. The parade and laser show were just magic! Although our children were 3 and 5 we found the stroller rental really great as it's a lot of walking.",Disneyland_Paris
143356968,5,2012-2,United Kingdom,"This was my first visit to Dianeyland Paris and it was a magical. There is so much to see and do. And there are also many characters to meet.Once you depart the hotel bus and walk towards the parks, you go through a security check, putting bags, etc through a x ray machine. The staff are very polite!!Then you are on your way to the park and sutdio you are greeted with the site of these beautifully maintained gardens and fountains. With of course the iconic image of Mickey Mouse's head designed in flowers, located in front of the incredible Disneyland Hotel.Once through the turnstile with your entrance ticket you make your way onto Main Street.....A typical small town American at the turn of the century. Which is made up of souvenir shops, (a little expensive, but excellent range of toys, clothing, keyrings etc). Also Restaurants, snack bars and even a barber shop, (if you fancy a quick trim)Straight ahead is Sleeping Beauty's castle. Which rises up and dominates the view! The entrance of course is free and well worth a look! The central plaza is in the front of main street and perfect for photo opportunities.The park is broken into four parts: Frontierland, Discoveryland, Adventureland and Fantasyland. Ride: I would highly recommend the  Haunted Mansion , Big Thunder Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean. and Alice in Wonderland Maze is great fun for all the family!! To name but a few of the rides.I would highly recommend the riverboat ride in Frontierland was very realxing and took about 30minutes.Also the train which circles the entire park, you can catch this at the station when you first enter the park. Stopping at each of the different areas of the park!!All park and studion staff are very helpful!! And help make you trip and experince on rides a memorable one!Tips: Don't forget you maps from the entrance to the parks, they were invaluable and helped mamximise your time there!

Also check if you have little ones, were all the toilets are located, of which there are plenty.I can't wait to return......Very highly recommened!!!!!!! Let the magic begin. Happy 20th Birthday  Disneyland Paris",Disneyland_Paris
143352296,3,2012-10,Ireland,"I just returned from four days in Disneyland Paris. There are a lot of pros and cons to this place. I went with my husband and my daughter who had just turned eight the day before we went. We arrived in CDG. Airport and we had booked return private transfers with a company called BT  Transfer, they were excellent, the driver picked us up promptly, he was curteous and helpful and we were in Disney in an hour. The car and the driver were impeccable. The driver spoke english so no problems there. We checked in to the hotel which was the NEWPORT BAY CLUB, check in was simple and the staff very informative and polite. Our room was on the Admirals Floor with a lake view. The room was a very good size and spotlessly clean. The bathroom wass also spotless. We were given towels which I must admit had seen better days . We got the usual bathroom stuff but only on our arrival.The other problem with the hotel is the heat, it was unbearable at times and when we turned it down the maid just turned it back up again and closed the windows as well. The next morning we went for breakfast, we had signed up for the 7.am breakfast as it gets really busy in this hotel, they only serve a continental breakfast and there was croissants, bread ,cereal and some sliced meats and cheese and fruit along with coffee and other drinks, so if you like a hot breakfast your out of luck. The coffee wasn`t replaced when the maid cleaned and she didnt leave any loo paper so we had to ring housekeeping to get extra towels and loo paper which I was a bit annoyed about and on another occaision we asked the maid to leave us extra towels and no she didn`t. Well on to the parks. If you`ve been to Florida or California as we have for many years this is a big comedown but if it is your first time you won`t be dissappointed. There is a lot to do, some of the rides are a bit outdated compared to what the kids have access to nowadays and some of the kids can be very critical of the rides, my own child included, but thats disney, if it aint broke don`t fix it. The shops are very expensive and not all staff pleasant. If you buy your child a balloon in the parks make sure it is tied properly as there are quite a few that end up on the roofs or up in the sky. Now about the meals. Cafe Mickey is the best restaurant in my opinion it comes in a meal plan and if you want to go off plan you can choose what you want off the menu and pay the difference. The food is very good and it is table service and if you have a birthday child with you a cake can be prepurchased and it will be brought to your child and the characters will sing and dance happy birthday. One tip, the cakes usually end up in the bin as they are very choclatey and the kids don`t seem to eat them, my own included, so thats a waste of 25 euro. There is another restaurant that has characters at it. Its called inventions and its in the Disneyland Hotel and it is the greatest ripoff. It is a buffet and there is very little choice for kids. The rest of the food is ok but at 175Euro for 2 adults 1child and two beers with the meal not very good value. It can be quite a long wait for characters depending on what time you go. There is another character meal that is quite good for little girls, it is called the Auberge de Cendrillion and there is a bit of choice on the menu but once again not very good for kids and very expensive. The characters are all the princesses and they come around to all the tables frequently and make the children feel very special. If your little one is into the princesses it is the best place to see them as there is a princess pavilion where you get to meet one princess and you have to queue to queue to get a ticket and then when you get your ticket with the time on it to come back you then have to queue again to get in. At this time of year there is alot of things closed in the parks for repairs and alot of the restaurants are closed. The waiting lines are also a lot smaller and tempers don`t get quite so frayed. They have a lovely parade and one of the best places to see it is at Small Worlds entrance as that is where it begins and if you get there just before it starts you will have a brilliant view. The new nighttime spectacular show which is done off the Castle is amazing and it can be seen right down Main Street and the fireworks afterwards are fantastic. At the moment it is all done up for Halloween and everything looks great. If you pick out the rides you want most make sure you get the fastpasses as these are a must, particularly if you go in high season. There is no organisation when it comes to meeting the characters in the parks, its basically everyman for himself and the parents can get quite forceful where there little darlings are concerned so toughen up the kids before you go. When it was time to go to the airport the driver from BT Transfers arrived exactly on time and because it had started to lash rain and the traffic was getting busy he brought us around another way and put a DVD on for my daughter so she was happy and no delays, I cannot recommend this firm enough. We had a great time and my daughter cried her eyes out having to leave so I`m sure we will be back. Just take note of some of the pitfalls and do your research before you go and you will have a ball. Sorry its so long but I wanted to get everything in.",Disneyland_Paris

143246904,3,2012-9,United States,"As an avid Disney World fan and past cast member, Disneyland Paris was on my  must do  list during my first trip to Paris. There were many things I loved such as the pirate ship for kids, waterfall out of the pirate skull mouth and the opportunity to explore Sleeping Beauty Castle. The Halloween decorations were cute and the Halloween show on the castle stage was great for kids. I was also surprised at the occupancy level...much lower than I thought but maybe that's because I'm used to WDW. I found the park to be slightly confusing to navigate as there were many more paths to take than expected and the castle, the traditional center of the park meant to be seen from any location, disappeared at times. At about 6 pm on our visit, we decided it was time for dinner and found that 6 of the restaurants (possibly more) weren't available. 3 of them being ones we wanted to try, the other 3 beings one we stumbled across but we closed. Why? Was it occupancy levels? Slow time of the year? That would never be acceptable at WDW. We ended up eating at Hakuna Matata and it wasn't very good. The parade and nighttime show were definitely unique and I was glad to experience that. Overall the visit was disappointing. Maybe my standards are too high because I'm used to WDW but I don't feel as though that should matter. All Disney parks should be held to the same service and performance levels and sadly this park fell short.",Disneyland_Paris

142843064,1,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Absolutely agree with the previous reviewers, we went in August with our two daughters. We arrived around 5pm as we wanted to avoid the crowds, waited in line, got the 1 day tickets for two parks, cost almost   250. On arrival the kids were blown away by both Cinderellas Castle and unbelievably Pirates of the Caribbean ride had hardly any queues at all, so far so good! Unfortunately things took a turn for the worst when we quickly realised that as the clock reached 6.30pm certain attractions were being rapidly shut down. By 7pm there was nothing open that the kids could go on (neither are big enough for the roller coaster rides), so we decided we would go visit the second park, only to find it was closed! Now, let's point out here that at no point at the ticket kiosk were we informed that the second park closed at a certain time, no they were quite happy to sell the 2 park tickets to us, tickets that were completely useless.Needless to say the only places open were the horrible food joints which were in total carnage and the retail outlets (surprise, surprise). Of course we had to eat somewhere as the kids were starving, and just when you thought the night couldn't get any worse along came Planet Hollywood! Yes, we should have known better, but hope springs eternal and none of the other food outlets were particularly inspiring. Let me just advise others, please do yourselves a favour and just go to the McDonalds a couple of doors down, because compared to Planet Hollywood it is a Michelin Star restaurant. Staff could not have cared less and the food....well I actually can't bear to write about how awful it was.I wrote to Disneyland Paris Corporate Office to let them know about our experience at there resort, to give them an opportunity to clarify why we were sold tickets for two parks when obviously they knew one of them was closed, to explain why attractions were shutting at 6pm. I did receive a response, it was the standard 'couldn't care less' corporate cut and paste, Dear Sir, so sorry for your disappointment blah blah, we value customer feedback, yours faithfully Ms Don't Care.So much for pixie dust!So you don't waste your hard earned cash like we did, DO NOT purchase the 2 park ticket if you arrive any time after 5pm, I am telling you this because Disneyland Resort doesn't.",Disneyland_Paris

142638708,3,2012-10,France,"If you go with the expectation of another Orlando Florida or Anaheim California, you shall be gravely disappointed! The Park is extremely under maintained, i.e. more than half of the rides were closed or under construction. The ones that were open are worn out and dirty. In the only (!!!) burger joint inside the park, called  The Hyperion  we saw cockroaches on the floor. No burgers there for us! Still, extremely long lines. Although there were enough counters   only one of them open, manned by a shouting Frenchman. Having tried the dreadful French version of a Hotdog, we left the park for lunch and found a 1950ies style Diner named Annette's which was better than anything we could find in the park. None of these ruined our day. What really got to us, was that we spent a full day there and saw one (1) single Disney character (i.e. Jack Skeleton). The kids got really upset about not meeting Mickey or Donald. What is wrong with Disneyland in France? A Disney character strike maybe? All in all: The lines were not as bad as compared to the States (it was raining, you see), the problem was: everybody seemed to be smoking!!

Be careful that in some of the roller coaster the children must have a certain height (for example at Indiana Jones it's 1.40 m); another roller coaster, a frightened one is The Space Mountain Mission 2: even if it is for children to 1.30 cm is Worse than every other in this park. You can use the fast pass (in the map that you take at the entrance there are signs FP at those games that you can take fast pass   spend less time queuing and more time having fun at all attractions displaying this symbol.

142472835,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"I absolutely love this park! When I first saw Cinderella's castle I almost cried with excitement. The rides are brilliant although they are mainly for the children but thats what it is all about. We were lucky that when we went they had started to get things ready for Halloween although it was only September and they also had the Christmas bits in the shops. The longest queue was about 45 minutes so not too bad although i did expect it to be quieter. A few rides were closed for refurbishment but there was still plenty to do. My sons favourites were definitely Fantasy Land and Discoveryland. Buzz lightyears lazer blast was his favourite whereas I love Space Mountain and Star wars,I was a bit disappointed that we didn't see more characters and when we did people did just push their kids to the front but my 3 year old soon learned to duck down and crawl between their legs. It was everything I imagined and I miss it so much. Can't wait to go back again.Although the weather was a bit chilly and we had some rain it didn't dampen our spirits!",Disneyland_Paris
142458514,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Great rides, amazing attention to detail and spotlessly clean. But the food, oh THE FOOD!!! Disney please sort it out. I don't mind paying a lot for food if it's going to be good, but I resent paying 15 euros for a burger and chips that isn't even as good as Macdonalds! Other than burger and chips, theres.....fish and chips, or fried chicken and chips. Nothing healthier than that. And there's nowhere to sit and have a coffee and cake, which, when your other half is queuing to get a ride with your daughter, would be a nice thing to do. Please Please Disney   sort out the food, DLP is a fantastic place to go, but the food really lets it down.",Disneyland_Paris

142417068,4,2012-10,Ireland,"We have just returned from a great (even though wet) 3 days at Disney Paris. The park is great and has something for everyone. But I'm just wondering has the 20 years caught up on it. I was really looking forward to the Peter Pan ride, but it's closed, and that was not the only ride closed or having techinical faults. Maybe the park should consider a week closed down, get it sorted and open up working! We were in 2 rides that shut down half way through   Buzz light year and Snow White   a 5 year old doesn't particularly like being in the dark with a witch in her ear!!! And I agree with one other reviewer, the staff need an injection of Disney magic, some are very gruppy!!! I think it would be worth advising guests of attraction close downs in advance. And the food in the park is shockingly expensive!! But it's Disney, that happy go lucking feeling gets you through the expenses, it's just the closed rides and gruppy staff that take the edge off the magic. But regardless I'll be back, bring on Thunder Mountain!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
142409549,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Halloween at Disney  the park is decorated with ghosts and pumpkins,the evil laugh pours out of speakers, the villians are out to pose for pictures the kids loved the halloween show with Mickey Mouse I must admit if I had room in the suitcase I would have tried to sneak the massive pumpkin with mickey mouse ears back home. The only thing that disapointed was the lack of the halloween theme in the hotels but not the end of the world!!The new toy story section is fab I lost count of the time we rode the slinky the dog ride. The whole Disney experience is magical for kids and adults and I do think if you are able people should definately try and go at least once.I am aiming to go back with my family but will go back for the christmas periods as for me the decorations are fantastic and the atmosphere wonderful.",Disneyland_Paris

Didn't help that a couple of rides were closed, and a couple of others had problems so we had to come back later when they were up and running. The park is OK, not as good as the one in Florida, and I didn't find the staff as enthusiastic as the one in the US. Food and drink is fairly expensive, but so is eating out in this part of France anyway",Disneyland_Paris

We lived in Florida prior to Europe and visited Disney World on multiple occasions   while this park is much smaller, it retains the same Disney feel as its US counterparts. We went in October, and the Halloween themed decor, parade, and show were delightful. Fantasyland was a big hit with the kids, whereas my husband and I loved Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in Adventureland (it was much better than the Disney World version!). Be ready to pay for your good time, but if you plan on going 2  more days, an annual passport is worth the cost (especially with free parking and 10% off food and shopping).",Disneyland_Paris

Although they were scared to go on any of the rides except for Its a small world they loved meeting all the different characters and princesses   they received hugs and autographs from all. and even though we had a few rainy and cold days   we had the best time! the only thing that was a little odd was that there really wasnt too much background music as i remembered from our trip to Disneyland years before..it was pretty quiet actually  maybe because of the rain?In any case   awesome vacation for us all!,Disneyland_Paris
142283524,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,Real nice feel as you enter the park & it also has a great selection of rides. I would say this park appeals to 5 years 12 years old...girls and boys will love it!,Disneyland_Paris
142277183,5,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Disneyland park never fails to entertain its guests. Its the attention to detail that put it in a league of its own. We have visited nearly every year since the park opened and keep coming back. Halloween is a favourite time as the theming is terrific. The parades are bright and cheeful and the fireworks one of the best your'll see any where. The ride times for the most popular rides were up to an hour, this can get quite tiring especially with small children. We eat at the Garden Plaza 27.99 euros per adult, but this did include un limited soft drinks, and eat as much as you like buffet with a good choice of main and dessertst. Booking is necessary if you want to eat at a popular time between 6 8pm. Good value for money. A one day 2 park ticket is good value for money but there is toom much to see in one day especially if it is your first time. We reccommend 2 days minimum.",Disneyland_Paris

In Spring if the weather is nice it is really pretty as well planted with bulbs etc all coming into bloom. What not to like, and if you do not like Disney then what are you doing there in the first place ? I told a colleague who was going there with his family that he would enjoy it, he was not convinced, when he came back he said he had a wonderful time and consequently booked again, says it all really. Christmas is a magical time, lovely shows and even if it rains there are places to go in between showers, nice gift shops with varying prices so suited to most budgets.",Disneyland_Paris
142216306,2,2012-10,Germany,"Great transport by train from Solihull to Disney. The Disney experience was appalling. Stayed in Sequoia Lodge, the door lock system does not work, the manager admitted that it was a 1992 system that badly needed replacing, but they had been refused permission to spend on the replacement system. Far too many rides and food outlets were closed, frustrating a lot of people. Rides also breaking down too much. Before going I doubted the French' ability to emulate their parent company's country's ability to host such an enterprise. Our visit only confirmed that it is not in the nature of the French to make you feel welcome and the events special. On the Disney channel in room one of the claims was that you can relax as all the on park transport is free, well no it isn't, some is but the train that takes you from your accommodation to the park entrance is 2 euros per person. Not in the Disney spirit at all. As for the breakfast experience at the lodge, despite the genuine and good natured efforts of the far too many black faces that do the menial work, the experience is one of being cattle herded. Very poor. Finally the name of the park defies the trades description act. It is not EuroDisney at all, and should be renamed FrancoDisney. It is very French, which would be fine if that had been what it was marketed as, but it is not. Thank heavens that we have a great family, otherwise this trip would not have been enjoyable at all.",Disneyland_Paris
142189118,4,2012-10,United Kingdom,"Visited with 2 kids aged 3 and 5 in October for 4 nights. Overall, a great alternative to the cost of Florida for smaller kids who will not appreciate the bigger rides etc. Very pleased with the quantity of attractions suitable for the children and had no trouble filling our first 3 days and then revisiting favourite rides etc for the final day. Much quieter in the parks Tues to Thurs with Friday and Saturday being much busier with queues of over an hour for rides which we were getting on in 10 mins the day before. The only disappointment is in the quality of service which, with few exceptions, is very poor at best! Every member of staff seems more concerned with talking to other staff members than customers. This ranged from being slightly annoying to some stores where staff were actually rude  certainly not the Disney spirit and a lot can be learned from their American colleagues. Parades were great for the children although you do need to get a good spot at least 30 mins before the start if you want to be able to see properly.",Disneyland_Paris

142016144,4,2012-9,Australia,"We did Disneyland as a day trip while we were in Paris for a week. I'm not a theme park person. There were so many adults at Disneyland without kids, and I honestly cannot understand why you would go there if you didn't have kids!My kids absolutely loved it and wanted to go back there the next day. My husband & I were pretty disappointed that there weren't more characters just roaming the streets meeting people (only Pluto and Chip & Dale), and all the waiting around in queues was so exhausting and annoying (but I think that's par for the course at any theme park). We waited half an hour to meet Mickey Mouse, 20 30 minutes for a few of the rides, and the most ridiculous of all was the 1hr 45min wait to meet a princess. For 'meet a princess', we were told it would be an hour wait and that you couldn't choose which princess   they have 2 princesses in there and you don't know which 2 it will be. I didn't really understand why they couldn't just have all the princesses there and have the queue move a lot faster. My daughter wanted to do it anyway, and it turned out she got to meet her favourite princess, Belle. Belle was very sweet, she chatted with my daughter for a few minutes and gave her a lovely, close hug. My daughter was SO happy and said it was her favourite part of our 6 week trip to France, so it was worth the wait for that (and the look on my daughter's face in the photos!). Finding food was a bit of a nightmare. My kids were looking forward to going to Pizza Planet for lunch, but when we got there it was closed (and there was nothing on the map or anywhere else saying that it would be closed)   major disappointment there. In the evening, we went to the Plaza Gardens Restaurant and waited 10 minutes in a queue, only to be told we were in the queue for people with reservations, then we waited in the other queue for over half an hour.The parade at 5pm was fun, make sure you get there early to get a good spot (and go and do a ride straight after the parade before the queues build up again). The show at closing time was absolutely spectacular   well worth staying until closing time (even though it meant walking among a huge crowd of people in the dark to get out of there   there were hardly any lights!)",Disneyland_Paris

We too advantage of the early morning passes from the hotel, which were a great way to avoid the worst of the queues for some of the rides .Tip: DO NOT miss the afternoon and nights shows.

Fantastic Rides for kids and adults. December month is extremely busy. The lines are very long, advisable to opt for a fast pass ticket so that you are allocated a time to return to the ride without standing in the line. After the park we made dinner reservation at Disney Village ,Cafe Mickey (kids can mingle with all the disney characters, memorable moments) Make reservation ahead of time. Disney Store offers great toys and gifts for all ages. Parks open 9 am for Hotel residents and10 am for day visitors and closes at 7pm. Disney Village closes late.

As a 71 year old grandfather I wasn't particularly looking forward to the visit, but I quickly found myself caught up in the marvellous atmosphere and happy to try out almost anything, including one or two scary rides. Minnie Mouse was a star with the kids, includi'tng our little one, and the parades were fully of colour and vitality. We must have chosen the busiest week of the year, but it simply didn't matter. Nor did the constantly changing weather. If I had a criticism, it's a minor one. It's hard to find an alternative to hot dogs and cheeseburgers, and although these are fine for a day or two, I was yearning for a different diet by day three. I loved it, however, and would like to try it again nearer Christmas when, I'm told, it makes you feel even younger! Can't wait.",Disneyland_Paris

141585211,3,2012-9,United Kingdom,"My husband's first Disneyland experience; I've been to the one in LA. This is not a patch on the US destination which really is where dreams come true. Poor weather   well, you've got to expect that in late September in France   didn't phase us. But lousy customer service really isn't what the Disneyland brand represents. And we experienced disinterested, laissez faire, really couldn't give a toss, 'service' from the start. No boring details necessary, just don't expect the enthusiastic welcome of an American park, where everyone employed there seems to want to be employed there.In terms of the park itself, I'd recommend focusing on Disneyland Park rather than Walt Disney Studios, but only because of the wonderful detail and full experience that the Park provides. When you enter Disneyland (which opens at 10am and the queues only get longer from then on), you enter Disney's dreamland. Each 'world' segues seamlessly with the next and is notable for its amazing attention to detail.Best advice is to get to grips with the FastPass system. If a ride you want to visit has a long queuing time, you can swipe your card at the FastPass reader (if the ride has a FP system) and be issued with an advance booking ticket. This usually lets you come back to the ride in an hour or so's time and gain entry via a special entrance; much shorter waiting time. But not all rides have a FP system and even those that do aren't always working.We stayed at Radisson Blu, a golf resort outside the village. It's got a free shuttle bus every half hour and was a great hotel for adults (not for kids really). If our budget had stretched to it I would have considered staying at one of the on site hotels; they sometimes offer early entry (an extra two hours' worth of visiting) as well as no travelling time.Despite queuing for several hours over the course of the day, we did and saw everything we had intended. Returning the following day for Walt Disney Studios was something of a disappointment   the only highlight here was the engaging movie experience 'Cinemagique'.All in all an extremely expensive visit that won't be repeated, in Europe anyway.",Disneyland_Paris

I knew it would be costly and I had allowed for the expense...no problem...Now here is the BUT...It was so so so crowded that it was impossible...impossible to go on virtually any rides...at all. When we arrived we headed straight for space mountain...ok...45 minute wait. Not ideall but doable. Then something to eat...another queue but doable....then things fell completely apart. The wild west ride...80 minute wait...the Indiana jones ride 70 minutes...but then it was closed. The pirates of the Caribbean....70 minutes. Then we thought we would try our luck in the other park. Every ride was well over an hour wait. Then we tried the Armagedon ....thing( could hardly call it a ride). The wait was supposed to be 10 minutes...what a croc...about 45 minutes later we emerged from there extremely disappointed. Then to top it all off we wanted to get in one last roller coaster so we queue for the rock and roll roller coaster...supposedly 70 minute wait....1 and 1 2 hours later we left the queue that we were still stuck in and couldn't see the end of.

This meant that by the time the Park had officially opened, on one morning we managed to do Space Mountain 4 times and Buzz 3 times! We liked to stay late too, and for 2 consecutive nights we headed over to Thunder Mountain at about 10pm (park closed at 11) and managed to ride it 5 time and 4 times respectively.

141391297,1,2012-8,Singapore,"We went to Disneyland after a year of our 4 year old nagging us   we had never been previously. On entering we were met with not one but 2 patrols of 3 armed army personnel who were carrying semi automatic movie style guns pacing the place. This was particularly terrifying for my children and such a stark contrast to the supposed magic that lay ahead. After going through what felt like miles and miles of security and fences we finally came to the entrance, where we were met with over a mile of effectively a shopping mall of hundreds of shops all selling the exact same over priced disney paraphanalia. Finally after much walking we got to the rides. Not one ride had less than a 30 minute wait and none of the rides we eventually got on were longer then 65 seconds. We searched in vain for characters to take pics with and did see one   Jasmine who was being chased by 30 frenchmen while she ran away   she was the only dressed character we saw the entire day. We searched and searched for Mickey and were told it was a 45 minute wait and 20 euros for a picture. Eventually exhausted disillusioned and unhappy my little girl asked to go home. this was an expensive day out which was effectively just an awful expensive unsatisfying trip which would have been much more rewarding if they were not trying to suck every single penny out of you as they could.",Disneyland_Paris
141350585,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Had a wonderful time, Fast Pass is great, The Castle is just beautiful, great rides, great parades and the 20th Anniversary Disney Dreams show is absolutely awesome",Disneyland_Paris
141348521,5,2012-9,Ireland,We went Wed to Sun and we got on everything Wed and Thu. We had three year old twins so would highly recommend to bring your buggy or rent one.  Crazy wait times at the weekends.,Disneyland_Paris

141240052,5,2012-9,Ireland,"Here you find everything you see on the adverts: Princesses, Disney Characters, magical buildings, castles, rebuilt scenes, roller coasters etc. There is nothing left out and the whole park has a lot of attention to detail. Be aware of the overpriced but yet low quality food items but other than that, what a fun park!",Disneyland_Paris
141224607,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"Brilliant, the attention to detail is fantastic. The characters are great with the kids. (Apart from Chip robbing my camera!) and there is plenty for all ages",Disneyland_Paris
141219348,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,Had a nice time at the parks but it was not verty good as a family that has come from england and dont no any french. All the speech on the rides was french so we knew nothing of the story behind the rides.But apart from that it was amazing :)),Disneyland_Paris
141214664,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"This visit was the 4th 5th visit for myself to Disneyland, but the very first for my Fiancee. We chose to visit on the first day of the 20th anniversary celebrations (1st April). We drover across from Normandy for the 08:00 opening and stayed in the parks until they closed at 23:00 before driving back (4 hours each way). I purchased the tickets online prior to visiting and saved a fair bit on 2 x 1 day 2 park hopper passes. The visit brought my childhood flooding back, it is so amazing how immaculate the park is, regardless of its age, it still looks the same as when I first visited for the parks 5th anniversary back in 1997. If you read through the park's history, it is obvious to see they are in financial trouble, but when you see the park, they obviously spare no expense and rely on people coming back and bringing friends family the whole clan!The 20th anniversary parade covered me in goose bumps and my other half could not stand still with excitement! She ended up sitting on my shoulders and video'd the whole parade on the camcorder. The overall spirit of the park is so alive and the evening celebrations are the highlight of the day by far. They way the images are projected onto the castle are nothing short of a technological marvel, this combined with the shooting flames and amazing fireworks from all over the castle provide a beautiful opportunity to re connect with the long lost child inside you. I was so buzzing from the evenings festivities, I drove the 4 hour distance back to the cottage wide eyed and singing away to a Disney CD that I bought in the park, while my other half was fast asleep.I won't review the rides, all I'll say is they are all unique, meticulously maintained and all worth trying at least once, maybe even 3 4 times!There are inevitably going to be negative reviews over an attraction like this, over long queues, distant staff, fast food quality, but what do you expect from something this large and so popular? Be prepared for your visit to Disneyland and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. If possible, bring your own bottles of pop water, some snacks etc and just buy a sandwich for your lunch dinner in the park. Bring a pack a mac just in case it rains and there won't be anything to ruin your day. Be prepared for queues, read up beforehand on the rides you want to go on and make use of the Fastpass system.As with any attraction city visit be careful with your valuables. If you leave something in easy reach, especially when the park is busy, you are asking for someone to help themselves. Just use common sense, keep passports ID in a bag across your body and do the same with money. Just pop into a toilet to remove a few euros if you want to buy something, its all easy if you prepare and plan your trip properly. Remember, you are alowed to leave the park and return to your car if you want a break for half an hour, as it is a long day in the park. Just remember to get your hand stamped on your way out!We always plan a trip properly and 'touch wood' nothing has ever gone so wrong that the trip has been spoilt. If I could afford to visit Disneyland more often, I would without a doubt visit at least once a month, outside peak times of course! Hope this review helps, and if your reading this, I hope you have a lovely trip to Disneyland. :)",Disneyland_Paris
141202249,3,2012-7,Malta,The place is definitely beautiful. Both my wife and I were amazed...and my daughter was excited to say the least. That is until we discovered the long queues. The fast pass helps but you would need to calculate that   with kids   the waiting time doubles!. Looking back i realise that I spent most of the time... waiting The place is packed with shops and food stalls...food is particularly expensive. The shows are really well organised and spectacular. The Tarzan show and stunt car show are not to be missed. A few tips which will make youir life easier:1. most people follow the map provided by disney to go around. You will find out that starting your  tour  the other way round will result in shorter queues.2. Once you are at the park use your fast pass immediately...so that you will avoid queues at a later stage3. ASK about the time for the final show. For some reason its not indicated on the programme...it is held after the final parade and is exceptionally good...DONT MISS IT!,Disneyland_Paris
141186667,3,2012-9,United States,"We are huge Disney fans and have been to the parks in Florida, California, Tokyo. Last week we went to Disneyland Paris. It's a very beautiful park, but something is definitely missing. It's the magic. The cast members just don't seem enthusiastic, and after 11 hours, we never saw a character which was bizarre. I guess once you've been to the US parks, you can see and sense the difference in the cast members and the atmosphere. Getting on the train after the park closed was horrible. People were like animals pushing and shoving to get on. Some ignorant woman shoved her way between me and my husband and he almost didn't get on. I have never seen anything like it. When it comes to manners unfortunately the Europeans are quite rude and unruly. Americans are so much more courteous. If you've been to the US parks, unfortunately you might be disappointed in Disneyland Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
141173824,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"This is again my 5th visit to the park. You walk in and straight away you feel yourself relax and feel like a kid again!! There are Disney characters everywhere and the walk up to the castle is full of shops and Disney fun! The castle takes your breath away and it's beautiful. There are maps available to show you were all the rides are and there are always staff walking around tha will happily help. The park is very similar to the one in Florida. The rides are superb, and there are rides that will suit all, from high thrill rides to Disney fun rides. There are loads of eating places around that will suit everyone, and the prices are very reasonable! Everywhere you look there are Disney shops so you can stock up on your souvenirs!! The parades are spectacular and get there early so you can get a front row view!Overall a fantastic day out and I wil, definetly be going back soon!!",Disneyland_Paris
141171247,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Had a wonderful time in Disneyland Park again. Children really enjoyed it (12&14) as did we the adults. Prices high for food etc but not much more than we paid 4 years ago on our first visit. The queues werent too bad and moved quickly. Got a full board deal so this saved us a fortune on food as we were there for five nights. The anniversary show after the evening parade was superb. The park was spotlessly clean, the staff friendly and helpful. A couple of the main attractions broke down which was frustrating but on the whole a thoroughly enjoyable holiday. Good walking shoes a must!!",Disneyland_Paris
141135436,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"I have been to Disneyland Paris twice before in the peak period of August during the traditional French holidays and it was, as I expected,busy. No complaints, I chose that time so no moaning if it is busy.However,this year went in the first week of August and it was absolutely jam packed with people.I mean queues of frustrated people everywhere...long queues at the rides,long queues at the toilets,long queues at the food outlets.I have never experienced so many people in a such a confined area.I cannot believe there are no safety limits in place,but it certainly seemed like they were squeezing as many people in as possible.I was lucky to get on three rides for my 60 odd euros...!! Value for money..no chance..!!Fast Pass.. what a joke.. machines not working and told to come back in three hours on average to get on..!!15 Euros to park as the car as well..this was my last time at DP never ever going back... if you want a day of ignorant people,pushing,jostling,smoking..fill yer boots at Disneyland Paris.. me I'm off to Parc Asterix..100 times better..",Disneyland_Paris
141119483,5,2012-5,United Kingdom,"Disney is DIsney, and despite it being manic we enjoyed ourselves lots!! The clue I found was to get in early (if you can use the early passes   USE THEM!!!) Ok, so not all attractions and areas opened early, but as I was travelling alone with a 5 year old it was perfect!! We got to do the rides my daughter liked over and over again before mayhem decended.",Disneyland_Paris
141117951,2,2012-4,United Kingdom,"We have never been so disappointed in a resort. Maybe the expectation was too great but what we found was a grubby and tired Disney that Walt would be ashamed of. The queues were horrendous, the food basic and expensive and very poor quality   considering this was France! The attractions also seemed to be in need of updating with the old favourites needed some TLC and very busy   even the rides for the small ones had queues in excess of an hour for rides of a minute or so. It rained a lot whilst we were there and there didn't seem much shelter apart from the restaurants. The Hotel we stayed on was about 10 minutes from the centre and was equally poor and basic with miserable staff and little service.Perhaps we would have been better off adding a few pounds and going to Florida. A great relief was that we went to Paris for 2 of the 5 days which as usual was fantastic   and only about 30 mins from Disney by train.",Disneyland_Paris
141110392,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"To be fair we visited as a family with 2 young children, at possibly the busiest time of year. The park was very busy, so the queues were long. It was very hot, nobody's fault, but long queues in the heat is not great   on 2 occasions, after waiting for a long time, and getting close to the front, the rides were closed. Once for maintenence, and another time for an electrical storm that never arrived, on both occasions, the staff were not great at passing on information, or making apologies.The food was dull and expensive   but we were expecting that.We still had a reasonably good time, but we certainly were not 'blown away' by the magic though.having spoken to people who have been to both, I understand that the American parks are much bigger, and impressive, with a far higher level of customer service.",Disneyland_Paris
141081898,4,2011-11,United Kingdom,"I love Disney Parks and have been to Florida many times, but unfortunately Disney Paris just doesn't have the same American touch! I love the way the Americans are so enthusiastic about everything, but in Disney Paris it just doesn't work. I took my partners daughter and children and they loved it and thought it was wonderful, but for me it was disappointing. If you have never been to the states then you will love Paris Disney but anyone already been to America will find it just doesn't come up to the mark!",Disneyland_Paris
141012861,4,2012-8,Cyprus,The park is a paradise for children. They have that game you can imagine. For parents is quite tiring.,Disneyland_Paris
140999833,3,2012-9,United Kingdom,"Visited disneyland paris plenty of times but decided to do a quick visit in sep 12 as we had free admission vouchers from sky tv offers and tesco vouchers. Found a nearby offsite hotel which saved a lot of money compared to disney accomodation.Was prepared for prices to be inflated being disney but this was over the top! 2 hot dogs with drink and fries to share came to 16 euros!! would nt mind but it was nt even that tasty!! but being a huge disney fans and frequent visitors to florida also, we decided just to make the most of our trip! Queues were short and longest wait time was about 30 mins but most rides were about 10 mins.Night time show with fireworks was amazing and worth the wait, glad to see they ve invested heavily in their 20th anniversary celebrations! Overall we had a great 2 days but were grateful we didnt pay full admission price! We were 2 adults and felt we were being ripped off at meal times etc so goodness knows how a family would manage!One big reason for the visit was to buy merchandise that we cannot easily bring back from the florida parks, crockery, glasses, ornaments etc...but we could not belive how much the prices varied between the parks for the same or similar items!i believe that 2 weeks in orlando works out cheaper on a day to day basis than what you have to spend here!It was a fun trip and at the end of the day its still great because its disney but feel its lost a little of its magic over the years!",Disneyland_Paris
140994842,5,2012-3,United Kingdom,do not be put off by these ridiculous reviews i have visited DisneyLand 7 Times with and without my Children and it only gets better the staff are absoloutly incredible and honestly cant do enough for you! The Staff and characters treat the children like royalty and make them feel like princes & princesses! i have stayed in all of the disney hotels and all are incredible although i do recommend Sequia Lodge its amazing and very cosy! BUT if you can stretch the budget do stay at the main 5* DisneyHotel its sensational!! Character breakfasts every morning something which other disney hotels do not offer for free! the park is literally on your door step! Christmas is by far the most amazing time to go its extra magical!The rides parades and attractions are superb and can't be beaten!you can NOT compare this to Orlando its a completely different experience trust me! i use trip advisor a lot and i am very easily influenced by the reviews on hotels attractions restaurants and it would be an awful shame for someone to read the negative reviews and not visit this wonderful place!!,Disneyland_Paris
140983601,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"If you have younger children, you should try & visit. The attention to detail puts UK theme parks to shame! Go on a weekday if you can as it was a lot busier on the weekend. Eating & drinking can be very expensive but there is a McDonalds on site that is reasonably priced. (very busy though) The rides are so much better than UK theme parks & even queues are bearable! The rides in the Disney Studio park are geared towards older children & the  Tower of terror  is a must! The French are not all very friendly, dont really understand queueing or the concept of personal space whilst  No Smoking  means absolutely nothing to them!! Dont let the small minority spoil your visit though. Let your inner child out & enjoy the tremendous attention to detail on offer. Dont miss the parades either! Get a good spot early! We loved it!!",Disneyland_Paris
140977149,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"Don't compare this place to Magic Kingdom. Its its own park and completely different in its own right. Firstly, its stunning. They have put so much effort into it looking perfect that it is lovely to wander around. There is so much to do and even the kids rides are great. Honestly try dumbo on a sunning morning in early magic hours... great fun!!Some lovely restaurants too.",Disneyland_Paris
140912114,3,2012-9,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from a 5 day visit, while it is magical and worth a visit, there is a lot that lets the park down.Firstly i would agree with others that the park is dirty for example the toilets are mucky before the park has opened to the general public on a morning? While others areas of the park are spotless and constantly being washed down, the cleaning seems inconsistent. If i am correct from reading other reviews it is supposed to be illegal to smoke in places such as disney land in France, the amount of people smoking is discusting ( We even saw a couple with children smoking what smelt like cannabis outside the pirates of carrabean ride) and they do not care if they are blowing smoke all over your children, disney land staff do not enforce non smoking policies, they are ignorned. For a place that is aimed at childen, i am suprised passive smoking seems to be promoted!! The ' Baby care centre' is very dated and could provide alot more. The park is not well planned out if you have a pushchair with you, you have to leave pushchairs unsecured outside most attractions and cafes. The vast majority of people in the parks do not care if they push into you, walk in your way or know how to que, this does spoil the magic of some of the attractions.Some of the staff lack enthusiam, and do not take great care about there job, for example we witnessed the staff that are litter picking walk past smaller bits of rubbish several times. Visiting in September we expected the park would be quiet, it was not, some of the attractions still has ques of 45 minutes   the fast pass however really helps and is a great idea. Some of the smaller attractions only has a 5 minute wait or no que though.The parrade was amazing as was the fireworks display.The characters are all really freindly and many made an extra effort with our shy son who would not approach them. I would reccomend staying in a disney hotel so that you can access the extra magic hours.Overall we would probably visit again, but would probably see if we could afford Florida instead, as have heard from people who have been to both that it is cleaner, more friendly and better organised.",Disneyland_Paris
140828921,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Wouldn't bother going again, it was dirty, there were only a few rides it was mainly shops and food outlets. The ride ques were very long the staff we encountered were friendly but the visitors were not! We arrived to find armed forces petrolling (Eeek!) then we found that people don't que and they have no sense of personal space! Lots of people were spitting, smoking and they have no manners. I didn't enjoy myself with all the queing we managed 3 rides a day max doesn't help that it opens late and it closes early. Best bit if the whole trip was the late night firework display on the castle.",Disneyland_Paris
140753544,5,2012-9,Greece,"Disneyland is a magical place, from the minite you step your foot in, it makes you forget all your problems! The best time to visit is September or in the Spring... in the Summer is too hot and the queus are long and in Winter there is a risk of finding some attractions closed! Furthermore, Saturday is a total nightmare in Weekdays there s only a 5 minite waiting time (awesome!) in all attractions. Be prepared to take some water and sandwich with you, if you cannot afford the expensive restaurants!",Disneyland_Paris
140687542,1,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We have been to Disney Florida & California and loved both of them. We only have memories of happy times.We knew August would be busy at EuroDisney so expected the queues for the rides and that the parks would be very crowded. Nothing prepared us for the amount of pushing, shoving and queue jumping. The restaurant food was terrible and the toilets were stinking.However, we had two really bad moments:The first was buying a Yearly Pass. The queue at the Annual Passport Office took 2 hours, despite the girl saying it would take 20 minutes. They are fanatical about you leaving buggies outside for Health & Safety reasons. They repeatedly asked us to do so, but we refused until we were close to the doors of the Annual Passport Office. When we eventually put the buggy with the others outside, our 2 year old daughter began to scream ...and scream ...and scream. She is in the Terrible Twos after all. We had one French man shouting abuse at us about her screaming. Inside we decided to complain about the long wait. The girl on the desk said   what do you expect, it's August!  We asked to see a manager, but she was another member of staff with an attitude problem. Basically they laughed in our faces. You pay a lot of money for Annual Passes and we expected administration to be fast, it isn't. What a waste of 2 valuable hours in the Parks.2) We came out of the Peter Pan ride late in the evening and decided to join the people gathering for the late night show. What a mistake! It became incredibly crowded in the area by the castle. Eventually there was absolutely no room to move. We were starting to get fairly worried by the pushing and shoving going on. On the one hand EuroDisney go on about not taking buggies into the Annual Passport OIffice for Health & Safety reasons, but people were trying to run us over with their buggies, so that they could get a better view. EuroDisney needs to take a good look at its crowd control, especially when you cannot see much in the dark. We would have liked to leave because we felt so uncomfortable in the crowd, but there was no room to move to exit.The only redeeming feature of the whole 4 days at EuroDisney was the parade at 7.00 pm, which was fantastic. Get your act together EuroDisney:  for the amount of money spent you expect better administration, better attitudes and better crowd control.",Disneyland_Paris
140668034,2,2012-8,Italy,"I've been to euro disney in August 20, 2012. at first I was full of expectations, I thought it was the most beautiful park in Europe and one of the most beautiful parks in the world, but I was really disappointed, I knew that the park was called a  flop , but not to this extent. the price of the ticket is very expensive compared to other parks, more than 65 euro, inside the view of the castle is beautiful, however the attractions are very old and date back to the 90's, there are only 4 attractions for adults and are not even too good .. I can recommend the park for families with children, they will be crazy, but for adults is 100 times better Gardaland in Italy..only for children under 13 years ..",Disneyland_Paris
140664859,2,2012-9,Spain,"Disliked the whole experience from start to finish over rated, 3 rd visit in 20 years and not changed my mind terrible resort.

140593033,5,2012-9,France,"I enjoyed Euro Disney more than my trips both to Disney in FL and CA. We visited with our two children, 5 and 7, and spent the day in the park with them constantly laughing and grinning and running around. Luckily in September the lines were not too long and the temperature was perfect. It was very enjoyable to be able to relax in the park without the heat and humidity of Florida. The park is traditional Disney and the TGV station arrives directly at the park entrance. If you want to have the whole experience, stay at the Disneyland hotel, it is located at the main entrance and a great but expensive addition.",Disneyland_Paris
140544315,4,2012-9,Spain,It is the best trademark of disney.

People were smoking in the lines cast members saw it but didn  t say anything about it.What was great this visit was the new night spectacle Dreams. Very very very beautifull.",Disneyland_Paris
140469004,5,2012-9,Austria,"We visited from Sept 11 to 14 and had a great time at Disneyland Park. Everything is so clean and there is music in the background the whole day long. A magical place. The waiting times were very short (mostly 5 15 minutes) on the weekdays but got longer on Friday. The parade at 5pm and the Disney Dreams show at 21 were amazing!We got to meet a lot of characters. The only downside of characters popping up is that, as an adult, you have to wait until all the small children are done with the autographs and photos. And they keep coming and coming. If you're not the pushy person, you'll have to hope the character sees you and just takes your hand so you can take pictures. I loved every day of our visit and I want to return soon!",Disneyland_Paris
140426711,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We had another four days here (about the right amount) and loved every minute. We went in high season this time & although busier we were rewarded with more stuff open. As the kids were older we were also able to go on more rides and watch the evening entertainment which was all excellent. The firework show at the end was particularly spectacular.The kids thoroughly enjoyed the Phantom Manor (we went on it several times) and the Big Thunder Mountain. Other popular rides included Buzz Lightyear and Star Tours. We too advantage of the early morning passes from the hotel, which were a great way to avoid the worst of the queues for some of the rides.Little things pleased us too   the flowers were fantastic and I really liked the posters showing the future from Victorian eyes   very clever.We're done with Disney for awhile though   sad to see that the prices have risen again. Does it really have to be that expensive?",Disneyland_Paris

However cueing slightly longer for smaller rides!Expensive for bottles of coke etc ! take your own!Lots of shows and things to see aswell as charatcter signing and meeting them also having your pics taken with them if you wish to do so! Queing system seems to better than when i went in 2005 where it was lik mostly free for all wel, the french mainly did this as it's was there way i suupose but now things are or shud stil be when we last went of cueing like here ! u wait your turn basically!",Disneyland_Paris

It is smaller than the magic kingdom and lacking the disney 'magic' but still quite enjoyable, you dont get the boat ride over to the entrance or anything like that !.It is quite expensive though, for the four nights we stayed plus the flights from Ireland just a couple of hundred euro extra would have got 2 weeks in Florida which is by far the better location as there is endless things to see and do.

140351150,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Well, what can I say about this place. We visited just for one day on the 29th August 2012. It will live up to your expectations and more. From the minute you turn up you are swept along in a wave of anticipation and excitement. We drove to Euro Disney from Normandy, so I   ll start with the carpark. It   s huge ! Make sure you take a note of where you have parked and also take note of how you are entering the park. It can be quite a walk to the entrance of the park, depending upon where you end up. There are toilets just before the entrance, but unless you   re desperate I   d wait until you get into the park as they are nicer. The whole process of having your bags checked and getting into the park went smoothly. We were told not to take any food or drinks into the park, so hadn   t. Ignore that though. Loads of people had picnics and drinks with them which will save time and money later on. We spent our time in the Fantasyland area, as we have a 7 year old daughter. As soon as we entered Minnie Mouse arrived for photo   s. One thing I will warn you is that there are no queuing systems for most of the photo   s with characters, and they will just pick a child, regardless of how long they have been standing there. Our daughter was one of the first to wait and one of the last to get picked. Thankfully she did though so we could get some photo   s. You will also experience the pushy parent syndrome whilst you   re there as well. Some parents had no shame in pushing their kids into the arms of the character   s to ensure a photo was taken , even if it was at the cost of another child missing out. We went expecting queues, and there were some, but not as bad as we imagined. The longest for us was one hour, and that was to go into the Princess Pavilion to have our daughter   s photo taken with a Princess. This experience is quite unusual. There are two Princesses, completely hidden from view, and you do not know who they are. The staff who control the queuing also say that they do not know. When you get to the front of the queue ( for us one hour later in a very warm room with very excited kids running up and down) you then get directed to one of the rooms where the Princess is, and it   s just pot luck as to who is there. Our daughter had wanted to see Cinderella. She ended up with Ariel, which was fine as she still enjoyed it, but we were disappointed to find out Cinderella was actually in the other room. A professional photographer takes the photo, and you are also allowed to take some. You can then buy the professional one if you want for 18 euros in a nice frame. I do think they should just tell you who is available for photo   s. It would save a lot of time for those queuing to then have their kids disappointed if it wasn   t the right one. The daytime parade is amazing. Probably the hi light for us. Our daughter absolutely loved it and we were lucky to get front row standing room, so she saw everyone up close. Again though, be prepared for the pushing and shoving. It can be very stressful there   all thanks to the pushy parents which range in pushiness depending which country they are from ! The park itself is very clean. The buildings are wonderful and the palace is just beautiful. There are plenty of benches dotted around for well needed rest. We did eat there   bit of a downer for us. We just wanted something quick and simple so queued up for a burger. 45 minutes later my much disgruntled husband turned up with the food. The service was extremely slow, and when you have queues of people wanted their food, the urgency to serve didn   t seem to be there. The other problem was finding somewhere to sit. You just have to dive onto the first available chair that comes up and don   t move otherwise you   ll lose it!We went into a couple of shops and bought a couple of souvenir   s, but be prepared to pay over the odds. The night time parade was amazing. The floats and characters are all lit up and the displays were just fantastic. The only thing we didn   t enjoy was having to start sitting on a foot square of pavement from 8:15pm to secure a decent viewing point! There were people everywhere just sitting down and we knew if we wanted our daughter to get a good view we would have to do the same. The parade doesn   t start until 10:15, fireworks at 11pm. By the time the parade started the rows of people were very deep, so being at the front entailed a lot of pushing, shoving, treading on feet and verbal abuse to get out the way so people behind can see !!! Leaving the park wasn   t great. After the fireworks and closing ceremony, everyone started piling to the exit. It was dark, there were no signs and you just ended up going along with the crowds, hence the reason why we ended up where the hotels were and not the car park. When you have a very tired young child, you just want to get back to your car as soon as possible. Would we go back? Not in this lifetime. Would we recommend it? Absolutely has to be done!So, a few tips : take your own food and drink. Remember where you have parked and how to get back there. Be prepared for the pushing and shoving, and either push harder or back away from it. If you want photo   s with characters be prepared to push your child forward. Take lots of money for the shops. Wear comfortable shoes, not sandals, so you don   t come away with sore toes like I did with all the people standing on my feet in queues etc. Take something for the evening, regardless of how warm it is during the day, as it did get quite cool in August. If you want to see the evening parade, find a spot and be prepared to sit for a good couple of hours. If you can, take something comfy to sit on !! All in all Euro Disney is amazing. The palace, rides, characters, buildings, cleanliness of the parks but best of all is the look on your child   s face when they see all the characters they love and watch. That is priceless.",Disneyland_Paris
140350924,5,2011-10,United Kingdom,"You simply cannot describe your first experience visiting Disneyland Paris, I was 22 but I simply loved it and got totally wrapped up in the 'magic' there was a vast selection of rides, eateries, transport, characters and lively atmosphere. From first stepping through the castle to seeing R2 D2 I enjoyed every minute of the day! We went during off peak time so got it at a reasonable price and queues were minimal! Snacks and food were expensive but you're paying for an experience as a whole. There is no shortage of helpful staff, street entertainment, parades and excitement at Disneyland...the park and trip is what you make of it, so all these people who didn't enjoy it can only blame themselves in my opinion!",Disneyland_Paris

It just brings back childhood memories.There aren't new roller coasters or such, but overall the park is maintained very well and the attractions are good.I've been to Disney at mid September and the queues were very small (I arrived at 10:00 AM).",Disneyland_Paris
140329625,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,A wonderful and magical trip with our daughter. Make sure you get there early to fit it all in. There were two parades when we visited. One about 11:15 on a train down main street and then the main parade at 5pm. Both are worth seeing but get there early and position yourself on the kerb.,Disneyland_Paris
140327456,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"Visited 11th 14th September, Park itself is amazing! Staff all helpful and speak good english. Food good quality! & Not a single que. Only two rides shut but this did not ruin my trip as September is obviously the time where rides & attractions can have maintence work done before busy periods such as halloween & chistmas, Rides however were amazing, 5 minute que for space mountain, 15 for thunder mountain and no more than 10 for all others.We booked 4 days but got the park done in a day and a half leaving time to visit studios which are also really good! Everything is themed amazingly! Even signs to direct you to toilets, Detail put in is outstanding! Stayed at the Santa Fe hotel, 10 minute walk from the park, Breakfast included which was yet again brilliant! Rooms are a decent size with 2 double beds, TV, Places to store clothes, Bath & Shower etc. Brilliant value for money! Magical for children & Would visit again. September time reccomended!",Disneyland_Paris
140323635,5,2012-6,Italy,"I went to visit Disneyland Paris for 3 nights and 4 days. It was the best money i ever spent. I went there with a friend of mine, her mother, and friend of her mother. And we all had a great time! All of the staff were very cheerful and helpful, they were always there to help! And the buses were VERY useful, and moving around Disneyland was very easy. The lines were abit long in some places, but thanks to the fastpass cards, things were alot easier! The only ride that we didnt ride because the line was WAY to long, and it was way to sunny outside to wait, was Crushs Coaster. and some of the rides were closed but we still had a blast! I thinking that we were very lucky with the weather and timing, the first day it rained abit, but even though that might sound like a bummer but it wasnt!! we ran for Space mountain because on a normal day you would have to wait for atleast an hour! but we only waited for 10 minutes! it was totally worth it. I cant wait to go back to disneyland, because i will DEFINITELY go back! I miss it so much already, it was the best 4 days of my life! :D  3",Disneyland_Paris
140313549,4,2011-11,Australia,"We had a great time at the Disneyland Park. The rides were really enjoyable particularly the Peter Pan Ride, Pirates of the Caribbean and the Mine Train Ride (not sure of the real name). We were lucky with the weather having blue skies, wonderfully crisp days. We also were there on a Sunday Monday in November so the queues were manageable. I hate to think what it would be like in peak season. The parade was great fun as well although it was getting a bit chilly by that stage. We stayed at the Disney Hotel and therefore had a couple of hours early morning to ourselves plus an express queue ticket which certainly helped.On the minus side, you couldn't walk two steps without running into merchandise stores   they were everywhere! We were lucky our 3YO wasn't too interested at this age in lots of toys. In addition the food was average, nothing to write home about. (A pity as this was France) I should also note this is our first Disneyland resort visit so we can't compare to the other resorts. Still, it was easy to get to Disneyland, we highly recommend the Eurostar from London, it drops you at the front door. Heading to Paris post our trip was very easy also. Overall a worthwhile experience.",Disneyland_Paris
140302492,3,2012-5,United Kingdom,"For all the hype about their anniversary year celebrations, we found the Paris park decidedly showing its age. Little seems to have been added in the way of attractions since our first visit twelve years ago. In 2010, visiting with friends, we had a very unpleasant experience when our tickets, booked through Expedia, turned out to be for only one park instead of the two we had paid for. Two hours elapsed before someone finally obtained replacement tickets for us. I was so angry that I complained to Disney on my return, and was awarded a free ticket voucher in return. Thus, we duly returned this summer before the free passes expired. No problems entering the park this time, and as ever the jaunty jazz music and bustle of Main Street raised our spirits and our expectations. The sun was shining as well. The day was full of promise. As soon as the gates opened we hastened to our favourite ride   Thunder Mountain   only to find it closed. By now the queues for other attractions were already offering waits of between forty and sixty minutes. This turned out to be the order of the day   queuing for up to an hour for rides which lasted just a few minutes. Only three attractions sampled before lunch.The afternoon was spent in the Studio Park. Here we managed only two entertainments   the always spectacular stunt car show and the Studio Tour. The queue for this ride was advertised at twenty five minutes, but turned out to be twice that long as so many of the cars were not operable. We witnessed one unfortunate set of tourists become imprisoned in a car whose hydraulic side wall door resisted all attempts by staff to raise it for over a quarter of an hour. The jeers and witticisms of the waiting crowd as attempt after attempt to raise the door failed at least provided some welcome relief from the boredom of the endless queueing. By four thirty, feet aching, we called it a day and, leaving the parks, queued again to eat in the Rainforest Cafe in the Disney Village, where the food was good and the antics of the animatronic jungle beasts amused us between the extremely short breaks between courses. We left feeling that the Paris park must be very low on Disney's list of priorities. It is looking its age, and is long overdue for a makeover. The endless queues, the closed and faulty rides and the high costs involved mean that, much as we love the atmosphere, we shall not be returning in a hurry.",Disneyland_Paris
140244542,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,All the family had a fantastic day with our Sky discounted tickets easing the pain of the very high admission cost. After queing 90 minutes to get in I had my expensive picnic set Xrayed and the cheese knife and corkscrew confiscated set only to find that no search was carried out on my person nor any handbags and I could have kept the steak knife provided in the restaurant had I had any evil intention. The option given to take the items back to the car and try to return was not realistic but it was not possible to surrender the lethal weapons and reclaim on exit. Clearly the approach to security was devised by Mickey Mouse himself,Disneyland_Paris
140210511,3,2012-3,Australia,Two major attractions were closed. I know like anything in this world things require maintenance and it would be helpful if this was known before we booked. There were no advisements on the website when we checked. The park appeared to be very busy with people everywhere (at a guess three quarters full) and I am sure they would have been just as let down. Most of the eateries were closed as well. The western restaurant located in Frontierland was excellent. The parade started 1 2 an hour late which we observed was very hard on elderly people who had to stand. Not an overall good experience.A big shame considering how far we had travelled to go there and it was not in the middle of winter.,Disneyland_Paris
140193145,1,2012-9,United States,"Having grown up as a season ticket holder at Disneyland California this is how I'd review DLParis:IF you've never been to a Disney theme park, you will enjoy it.IF you've been to WDW or Disneyland California, you will find it too small and the castmembers both rude and obnoxious. i.e., stay away.As a former American, francophile, who lived in Paris, the castmembers at DLP are uniquely rude and condescending. The park is tiny, you can complete the park in half a day. You're money and time is better spent elsewhere.",Disneyland_Paris
140124524,5,2012-9,Barbados,"Excellent value for money. Disney Paris is an amazing fantasyland with one incredible attraction after another. It is hard to understand how Disney manages to provide so much attention to detail and such an abundance of attractions, rides, features for a single economical admission price. The Multi media fireworks display is incredible. A great place for the kid in everyone.",Disneyland_Paris
140085964,4,2012-7,United Kingdom,"We took our five year old boy to Disneyland Paris in July for three days  two night. I've broken down my review into accomodation and the park.Accomodation   try and stay at a Disney hotel if you can. The main benefit is that you gain access to the park two hours before the general public. Not all the rides are open but there's enough to keep you occupied. We stayed in the Newport Bay Hotel. Don't expect five star luxury but it has a lovely indoor and outdoor pool (it was really hot when we went so used the outdoor pool twice and avoided the park at its busiest time). Just make sure you get onto the Admirality Floor   it's a bit extra but you get access to wifi, mini bar, free pool towels and you don't have to book a breakfast slot. You also get to meet a character on arrival (and another if you go back to the hotel when the Eurostar arrives!). Characters in the park get mobbed and there are hardly any around so it's your best chance to meet one.Park   do use the early entry if you're a hotel guest as it gets really busy in the afternoon   especially in school holidays. We arrived on the Thursday afternoon and the queues were horrendous. You also need to plan what you're going on. We found the fastpass system a bit rubbish (fastpassed a ride at midday and couldn't get on until about 5pm!) but it's worth fastpassing a ride that you really want early in the day. Do some of the shows   the stunt car display was fantastic. Bring food and drinks with you as these are stupidly expensive in the park and mostly junk (only found one stall selling fruit in the film studios). They don't seem to restrict what you take in so bring snacks and plenty of water (there are plenty of fountains to refill them). Do go to the parades   my son loved them more than the rides (the night one is very late but fantastic).  Overall, it's a great experience for the kids. Some of the rides are a bit old and tired and the queues can be a nightmare at times but my son loved it all   especially the characters and shows.",Disneyland_Paris
140071099,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"We had a one day mission to complete both parks and succeeded. I guess we chose a good day to visit, mid week in September. The park did seem quite busy in areas but we managed to get on everything we wanted to with about two hours to kill before the Disney Dreams show at 9PM.Both parks were spotlessly clean and everything looked well cared for. The Disney Dreams show was absolutely fantastic.My top tip would be to get to the studios park first as this can be completed in a few hours then move on to the main park for the afternoon. We noticed a lot of people seem to do the parks the other way round as the studios park started to get very crowded from about 1PM.A fantastic day out!!",Disneyland_Paris
139937952,5,2012-4,United States,"Me great pleasure to walk in the park. I recommend going during the week. Over the weekend, a lot of people. And when a lot of people, a sense of the magic disappears. If this happens, use the fast pass. Our family favorite rides: Pirates of the Caribbean, Phantom Manor, Star Wars. For young children, Peter Pan is a very good amusement, Labyrinth Alice in Wonderland. . One day we got to the Princess Pavilion, which wanted to get a lot of people. We decided to go. We stood a full hour. It was a room where there was a Cinderella she had one and we had to quickly take a picture with her. We have been disappointed and were very tired.The super slides Indiana Jones and the mission to the moon, we go, next time ...maybe",Disneyland_Paris
139927985,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Took my 5 year old nephew for 2 days to Disneyland and wasn't really sure what to expect. But we both had a really great time and plans are already afoot for another trip next year. Though there are height restrictions for some of the rides, there was still enough so that my 5 year old nephew could go on lots and not feel like he was missing out. The park is huge and it's useful to plan where you are going, so you can avoid walking back and forth from one end of the park to the other. I'd highly recommend using the Fast Ticket System. With this system you can use your Park Pass to get a specific timed entry ticket for the popular rides   so you can go away and come back during your time slot rather than queuing for hours. Our favourite rides were Big Thunder Mountain and the Buzz Lightyear one and also the Tarzan show. The caves were great too   there's a lot to enjoy and we barely scratched the surface. In order to see the various parades and the fireworks at the end of the day, it's worth bearing in mind that it can be a really long day for little ones. One thing that was irritating was the fairly endemic queue jumping that went on. We found it was important to be firm and keep your wits about you or suddenly whole families and friends would push in front of you. All in all a really enjoyable time at Disneyland, we are already planning a return trip.",Disneyland_Paris
139912406,5,2012-9,United States,"Visited Disney Studios and Disneyland Park on a whirlwind one day trip to Disney. The Disneyland park was fabulous! On a weekday in September, the crowds were not bad. Short wait times for most of the rides, except for Big Thunder Mountain which had a disproportionally long line.What made this rating  Excellent  was the 20th Anniversary  Disney Dreams  night time show at park closing. I've been to Walt Disney World in Florida several times as well as amusement and theme parks around the USA and Europe. This was BY FAR the BEST show I've ever seen at a park. Absolutely stunning. My group agreed that it was almost worth the park admission to see this show and nothing else. EXCELLENT show and perfect way to end a fun day at Disney.",Disneyland_Paris
139884693,3,2012-9,United Kingdom,"We only really needed 2 days to get the best things covered in Disneyland Paris but our package allowed for 4. Loved the 20th Anniversary parade train   smaller parade experience but a chance to see things because it was less competitive than the 7pm parade.The 10:15pm fantasia lights parade was crazy busy and not great for 4 year olds (despite being told on check in that it was a must see event). The 11pm light show on the castle was amazing but again not worth the late night for little ones. Oppressive crowds who are not controlled (as they are for the parades) and lots of stressed people with strollers trying to get through.Smoking areas were not stuck to and there was so much smoking around the park that it felt as though we were in a smoky pub, not outside! Much worse at parade time. Limited availability of water fountains and very high cost for drinks and snacks was disappointing. The shops all sold the same things and it would have been nice to see some variety.The train station was closed in Fantasyland without explanation.Our daughter had an amazing time but one overnight with two full days would have been sufficient with good planning of activities.",Disneyland_Paris

Everything was very easy to do with children, from hiring a buggy if needed, to plenty of ramp access and space around the park.",Disneyland_Paris
139821691,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We took 6 adults and 3 young children as a group booking made direct with eurodisney staying at the Disneyland Hotel at the park entrance.The outward journey was excellent and the proximity of the station to the park and the hotel along with the Disney Express luggage service made for a good start to this short break. When we checked in to the hotel there was much confusion over which adults were in which room with the children and the reception staff seemed to be incapable of sorting it out. As a consequence, we experienced significant problems with allocation of charges to the right room person and had to spend some time at check out on the last day trying to resolve the mis allocation of charges. Whilst the original mistake is possibly understandable, not being able to correct it at check in is not the standard of service we expected from a 5 star hotel   even at Disney! However, the standard of service we received from other staff suggests that this failing was due to a single poor member of the reception staff.It is also not acceptable in a hotel of this standard and price, not too have tea coffee making facilities in the rooms, especially when the minimum charge for room service is 15 euros which makes for a very expensive cuppa! Moreover, when we did resort to room service one evening, the coffee and tea were no better than luke warm and came with no milk at all so were even cooler by the time it finally arrived at our second request. Also, our order for breakfast in our room was lost by the room service waiter and never materialised.Whilst this is a large hotel and breakfast is understandably busy, the dining room staff were friendly and helpful and the buffet breakfast excellent quality, hot and constantly replenished.There was a lack of information on where and when Disney characters would be to meet with children. A daily sheet delivered to each room   a la cruise ship programmes   or at least a daily notice would help parents plan.The Disney Express luggage service was especially useful (and efficient) on the return journey allowing maximum time in the park on the last day. Whilst the train journey was smooth the Eurostar staff were not and the special childrens' meals   goats cheese pasta and sweet potato pure     were not what my 4 year old grandchild eats, and she eats most things! The adult dinner was more of a light snack than a meal   even EasyJet portions are bigger. Given we travelled Standard Premier, this was not in our view acceptable.Overall, a good trip with failings by some staff members and eurostar catering detracting from the experience.",Disneyland_Paris

139757757,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"I have always loved this place and I have been going to it since I was a child myself but this is my first time I have been with children. I took along side another adult (the children's mother) 2 children a 5 year old and a 9 year old, they both loved it, it was their first time here and it was amazing to see their faces when they saw the castle for the first time, it was priceless. The first day was just going on the well known rides and rides that I knew that both children could go on with no fuss, as it is quite a large park they got tired by mid afternoon but that was ok as we were staying in a Disney Hotel so we could just nip there for a rest. A word of advice if a child, no matter how old they are has never been on a roll a coaster before then DO NOT take them on the Spacemountain Ride, this 9 year old hated it.I arranged for a disney character breakfast at Mickey Cafe and it was the most amazing breakfast I have ever had, and that was me not being able to eat wheat... The characters were wonderful with the children, Tiger tickled them until they ended up on the floor, the chipmunk's danced with them and Goofy came round 2 3 times just to spend time with them. The only thing I would say about it is that the loos were awful, 2 were blocked and leaking dirty water so you had to jump across the puddles to get the 1 clean toilet, but other wise it was amazing.I also arranged for them to have a birthday cake in the hotel and the whole restaurant sang to them which made them have the biggest smile on their faces.The park was clean, not too busy and a happy place to be I would definitely go there again, on my own and with a family.So thats it I hope you enjoyed my last review and this review.",Disneyland_Paris

She was also in a wheelchair and the park staff did everything they could to help us.Make sure you go to City Hall on main street and get yourself a special card which allows you special access to all the rides   this was absolutely brilliant and also gave her a great view for all the parades and shows.

Whilst many of the staff still showed the Disney charm, some were indifferent, others didn't appear to have been very well trained and a few down right rude.

No characters; in more than 8 hours in this park, I saw not ONE character. Half the restaurants were closed. Dinner   consisting of inedible burgers, soda, fries cost 50 Euro for three people. The Disney dreams show was spectacular   and it is the ONLY reason it didn't rate a 1 instead of a 2.

139626302,5,2012-9,United Kingdom,"We recently attended Disney's 20th Birthday Celebrations and all I can say is that if you have the opportunity to go, take it!!If you stay on resort you can get in to the park at 8am and stay until the park closes so you really get your money's worth. If you're not staying on resort, and you have tickets to visit both parks, head to Disney Studios first and ride all of the ones that don't have fast passes as this park closes earlier than the main park and it will give you a head start!!If you are fortunate enough to be able to see the Disney Dreams night time show, make sure you are in a prime position at least an hour before it is scheduled to take place.People will appear from everywhere and you will soon have to defend your place for all you are worth!! Watch out for people who will put their children on their shoulders and climb up a bank in front of you!! This is what happened to us   we were so shocked to see that people were climbing all over Disney's carefully manicured gardens to get in a good position and even if you think you are well positioned, please ensure there aren't any potential climbing aids in front of you as other people will use them!!My advice is to stand on the curb in the central plaza facing the castle, there you will get a good view, alternatively, you can stand on the hill by the entrance to Adventureland (but mind for the overhanging branches that could impair any photos you want to take   so stand the other side of them). Also, don't stand too close to the castle, you will lose the effect of the lasers, lights, water cannons and effects   there are some images that are projected on to the 'doorway' of the castle so try to be able to see these but the main spectacle is the effects on and around the castle and you will miss these if you are too close.Be mindful that there is a VIP area by Casey's that they don't rope off until closer to the time and an exclusive wheelchair access only area if you get 'moved on' you will have lost out on obtaining a good vantage point   if you are not sure of the exact position of these, ask a Cast Member beforehand.When it comes to general parades if possible, stand in front of a bin!! They are on the curb side and Disney cast members won't allow you to step off of the curb during a parade so you won't have anyone stood in front of you. Lastly, Disney are currently offering a Disney Dreams Dinner Package, although we didn't do this, (and I'm sure the food is amazing), the vantage point you have from Casey's garden isn't great as you still have people stood in front of you!!",Disneyland_Paris

Having visited the one in Orlando thrice and the one in Hong Kong once, I have to say that this one seems rather small in comparision. I would say half a day is enough to see Magic Kingdom, and maybe another half day for Walt Disney Studios.

Also paid to eat with the characters and not all of hem come to your table which is annoying. And the French are the most rudest arrogant people I have ever met.",Disneyland_Paris

139430425,4,2011-10,India,"After being here for a day I realised how dumb I was to think that I could cover this park in a day and not to mention the disney studios too! I would say that each of these needs 2 separate days. The park is very good and wide spread. One thing that I would recommend is that as soon as you get there, pick a copy of the events happening on the day. This will also include the parade timings. These events are definitely worth seeing. In fact there are parades events at both the parks and you can plan such that you view all but then you will be running around all over the place! Also, there was a queue for the entry tickets (we did not buy online). It was not very long but did take us a good half an hour. We bought the both parks 1 day ticket which I would stringly suggest no. And if you do, then keep your hopes low   you will not be able to do much in either parks. You will have to make choices.One aspect of the park is the THEME and the other is the THRILL. The rides can also be classified as theme rides and thrill rides. Irrespective, all rides have a huge queue. If you are pressed for time, then do consider investing in the fast track tickets. Try to prioritise the rides or rather choose which ones to go on. The rides had wait times of more than an hour! Pretty ridiculous but thats the way it is. So if you are prepared to spend on the fast track tickets, you can really save a lot of time and energy. My personal take away was that enjoy the theme and the ambience of the park and dont focus only on the rides. If you really want thrill then go to an amusement park and not a theme park. In retrospect, I was so busy queing up for the rides, that I forgot to enjoy the theme! You can just keep wandering and appreciating the creativity all around! Its beautifully crafted and there is great attention to detail. But sadly I didnt have time to appreciate all this. All I did was run around like crazy and stand in long never ending queues! honestly I regret this and would not want anyone else to make this blunder!Eating inside the park is definitely expensive and if you are a family with kids, then be prepared for a lot of spending. I found the souvenir shops very nice. Though again it was the park closing time and we had to rush but the shops had so many things to choose from. Quite a variety of items. Again, if you are pressed for time, do budget in an extra half hour for the shops. Alternately, there are shops in the Disney village that also sell these items. The Disney village is outside the park and open after the park closes. So you can leave the shopping for later. We also had our meal at the village. there are a lot of shops restaurants there. So once the park is closed, you can spend a good 2 hours here if you have any energy left.",Disneyland_Paris
139416094,4,2012-8,Romania,"The train will bring you from Paris to Disneyland in about 1 hour.Once you get there, you will have to face the long queues for tickets, so better book online before going there ! Also, a lot of hotels in Paris can give you a discount voucher, which will lower the price from 75 eur to 55 eur.If you wanna try all the attractions inside, consider at least 2 3 days for this ! Everything is amazing, just like on TV or even better :). If you are an adult, don't miss Space Mission 2, which will take your breath ! For kids, any other attraction is fine, if you have enough nerves to wait 40 45 minutes to jump into Pinocchio's train which leads you through the entire story, or any other kids story.If you go in the other park, the movie one, ride the elevator from  The Tower of Terror  ! You won't forget that trip !Too bad that you have to wait at long queues and some attractions are closed due to some  technical issues ... I used commas because they don't have any problems, they just don't want to open some of them :(:(.

I was a little worried about how busy it would be at the end of August, but we managed to do everything we wanted to do in two and a half days.

139347537,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We had one full day in the actual disneyland park and the only piece of advice I would give is to plan your day and decide what rides you really want to go on. We took full advantage of the fast passes on offer. They are free and all you have to do is swipe your park ticket in a machine outside the ride and you are then allocated with a time slot of about half an hour in which you can effectively queue jump. The food was pretty repetative, burgers and chips and ice creams and it was quite pricey but that is expected in places like this so we took our own snacks. The ride I would most reccomend is space mountain, it was absolutely thrilling, also the buzz lightyear ride was good.",Disneyland_Paris
139339974,4,2012-8,India,The parade and the the Dreams show was worth every penny had great fun there..the only problem is that they should do something about the 1 hour plus waiting lines at most of the rides and attractions..when they know that there is always going to be a crowd they should do something about it..secondly it does need a facelift.Overall a wonderful experience will do again when there.,Disneyland_Paris
139338751,4,2012-8,Australia,"It is within walking station of the train station. There are more adults than children in most areas except for Fantansyland. It is better to buy the tickets online rather than onsite. As this was the 20th anniversary, there was a special entry rate of 51 pounds for 2 parks (1 day) and this will go on till March 2013. There is a MacDonald outlet (very busy at most times) and a Disney store at Disney Village that is just external to the parks. You can most Disney merchandise here without entering the park, and thereby saving your entry fees. Be prepared to queue up to an hour for the rides, alternatively get a fastpass.",Disneyland_Paris

139333940,5,2012-8,Ireland,"Disneyland itself was amazing!I just wanted to advise and warn people about getting your train tickets from Paris central to Disneyland. First of all no one would help us at the local Metro station, even though there were 2 ladies in booths meant to help and even though I asked politely in my few words of French. This was after I tried to understand how to get a day pass as we would need to return to the city later. The ticketing machine was not very clear in offering you options. So after 20 minutes deliberating and getting what we thought were day passes for all zones, we got the train to Disney. At the station the tickets would not feed through the turnstiles and immediately some local Metro worker was over to us, asking to see our tickets. I thought oh great someone will help, but he ended up shouting at us, telling us the ticket was wrong and we have to pay a penalty fine of 60euro each and there were 5 of us!. I apologised as we had not intentionally done this and offered to pay the balance of fares. but he was so rude and arrogant, and kept shouting at this, eventually he dropped the fine to 30 each, threw a docket into my hand and pushed us through the gates. later that night I noticed that the only wrote half of the fine price on it and quite obviously pocketed the rest of the money as a few of his other collegues as well were joking about  how many they caught . There is a definite scam going on in the Metro station at Disney and I hope no one else gets caught. Disney is outside the Metro zone, so you need a national ticket in a way which costs about 7.50 euro. I hope this helps someone ..",Disneyland_Paris
139333842,2,2012-8,South Korea,"My 4th visit to this park, my first was in 1992 when it opened. Back then it was an excellent park, but per the years it has deteriorated. Even with the studio park, the old park has lots it's magic. The light parade has changed their lights and they know look cheap (where has the high standards gone), the buildings look old, the walkways, rides look tired and no new injection of enthusiasm into the park. Some of the staff are great, some good and some not so, but I understand that with such a large manpower, they can't get it all right but as Disneyland..they should. Seeing a member of staff smoking behind the fence is not what I would expect from this park, the magic has gone.",Disneyland_Paris
139331058,1,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We booked a week at Disney this summer, we were made up of my step mum, her sister, there three young children, my brother and my girlfriend. We have all been to Disneyland Paris before and had a great time and given the price and reputation of the park you wouldn't expect anything less!When we entered the park we were overcome by the amount of people that were being allowed into the park, I realise its summer but it was unbearable, it soon became clear that profit is the only thing that seems to matter here now! The fast pass machines were mostly broken and even if you did manage to get a ticket from one you will likely be waiting 3 5 hours before you can use it, or of course you can queue for 70 90 mins, the staff are rude and dismissive and very unsympathetic.We even resorted to using the arcade to pass time only to find most of the machines were broken or completely out of order although you have to put you money in to find out which ones!We didn't want to chance having a bad meal to top this all of so we booked 2 days in advance to eat at the blue lagoon restaurant inside the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' ride. It turns out if you like eating food in the evening like a normal human being you will have to book at least the day before for more or less any restaurant in the park. When we eventually had our meal they squashed all 8 of us round 2 tiny tables in a corridor 40 mins late! I would not exaggerate for effect but this was one of the worst meals I have ever had, we were so shocked, I complained about the table size and location and that one of the seats was covered in beer but it would have been pointless to complain about the meal! I wouldn't have known what to say. It was laughably bad and cost us    300.I could go on and on but to sum it all up none of us will ever be going back to Disneyland Paris, I feel betrayed and angry as I have recommended it so many times before and have fond memories of it from when I was younger. I hope our experience was unusual and that anyone going has a great time but if you are thinking about it I strongly suggest you think carefully about what kind of company you're going to give your hard earned money to and if your kids really are going to have a 'magical' experience.",Disneyland_Paris
139330464,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"Having been to the Disney parks in Florida we have always been keen to find out what the Paris ones were like.Out of the 2 parks there is far more to do in the Disneyland Park and at some of the places you could almost be in Florida. The rides were good and the parks were well kept and while we were there is was 30 degrees so it really did feel like Florida.I would advise that is staying in a Disney hotel to take advantage of the extra hours on the Disneyland park as we tried in Walt Disney Studios but they did not open their gates until 10.00 and then it was a mad scramble for Crush's Coaster which in view of the hype was actually quite disappointing.Be prepared for people pushing and shoving and smoking everywhere, the cost of food and drink is extortionate so have plenty of Euros ready. We enjoyed some of the set meals in the parks fast food restaurants we shared platters that cost    12 and found there was plenty to eat for lunch and in the evenings we ate in Disney village. The best was the Rainforest cafe which at    20 was not cheap but worth it for the good food and experience, Annettes diner served good burgers but they were vastly overpriced but then Disney has the monopoly.We were there for 3 days and felt it just enough to do the parks and rides, it was expensive but good and we hope to go again one day.",Disneyland_Paris
139304603,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Eurodisney was born into a privileged family of Disney Success in 1992 and followed on from a long line of highly successful and popular theme park resorts.Unfortunately it hit trouble almost straight away from its opening with numerous labour problems and losses that gave its American creators their first taste of loss related sleepless nights.The huge beast of a theme park that greeted us on our arrival is very much the product of this troubled history...it has to make money and it is unwilling to compromise on this even if its going to spoil your day.Almost without fail, if you read any of the Eurodisney reviews, the major complaints are the eye wateringly high prices that you will encounter for everyday items such as bottled water.The location of the park makes it virtually impossible to visit anything other than a Disney related venue or Hotel to eat and drink so there is there is a definate feeling that your being held hostage.The Park absorbs a huge number of people each day and I got the feeling that whilst I was there (Late August) it was not always able to cope with the vast swaythe of humanity that filled its every corner.Consequently the infamous queues become the major events that eat into your day...sometimes for up to 90 minutes for the major rides. A strange psychological effect also seems to kick in once youve been in the park and you become fully engaged in the 'queue to enjoy' mentality....you actually start to wait in huge lines of people to get on rides that are fully visible and which are obviously not that good....this happened to us...and we waited 45 mins for a 60 second ride on the buzz lightyear 'orbitron' which was nothing more than a basic 10 gondola carousel that can be found at any Fairground.Much has been written about the Staff at Disneyland....our experiences were positive when you consider that they have a hugh 'people' workload to deal with.Many reviewers comment that the Staff are Hostile if you dont make an effort to speak a bit of French....this is Pathetic and not true...Disneyland is a multi cultural and Multi Nationality experience and the Staff are mostly very comfortable with this.Eurodisney cost $4 Billion to build and this can be seen in the amazing attention to detail on decor, design and finishing touches which truly continue the Walt Disney 'Quality' Philosophy...unfortunately its in the operational aspects that I felt the whole experience at times felt like a failure....at times just the little things that spoilt the illusion...like cobwebs on the exquisitely detailed figures in the 'Its A Small World' ride or the rust stained hands and clothing that we all picked up from walking down the spiral staircase of the Cinderella Castle which was in almost complete darkness and highly dangerous to both young and old to navigate down.And the Good?....there is an event currently running that re awakens the spirit of Disney for all who see it...and even after all the open arguing that we witnessed between people fighting for good viewpoints for them and their children we were all in silent awe at the Disney Dreams 20th anniversary show.The show has been created to celebrate the 20 years of Eurodisney and uses hugely powerful projectors to turn the cinderella castle into a multicoloured canvas for a celebration of the Disney that was (Not is!). Absolutely NO expense has been spared here.The projections are combined with pyrotechnics and hugh moving fountain jets and also spray projections (Images projected onto hugh plumes of fine water jets)....but thats not all...the Disney team have also combined numerous multi colour multi beam laser projections into the show with additional high power moving sky beam spotlights and amazing huge multiple jets of fire that you can actually feel burn your face from more than 100 metres away. All these elements are not just fired off randomly...they are syncronised to all your favourite Disney music and work together to pull off a truly amazing 20 minute show.At the end of the evening we joined the numerous tens of thousands of other people leaving the park and for just a minute it felt like we had all forgiven Eurodisney for its many imperfections in favour of a single event that had moved us and made us rediscover our long lost Disney Dream.",Disneyland_Paris
139266256,1,2012-8,United Kingdom,"I think ones response might depend on what one was expecting. I went with my two youngest daughters (who regarded it as a trip of a lifetime) and was expecting a general standard comparable with other family focused entertainment. To enter there was a queue (or more accurately a jostling crowd) waiting for over 90 minutes in the hot sun with no shelter, drinks or entertainment (09:00 10:30). Only when we got to the gates that we found that this was the bag check (there was no way of knowing this or indeed of getting through   although bigger adults were shoving past smaller children I think they still only gained 15 20 mins). After that the ticket queue began which was an additional 60 minutes complete with ticket touts (or rather scammers   they did not actually have any tickets   just wanted money). Shelter from the sun at least, but no food, drinks or entertainment   very tough on a five year old and nine year old   and plenty of  attitude  from the staff who I think resent having to work in somewhere like this. (10:30 11:30) Very expensive entry prices for the travesty that we were about to experience which I'll report separately.BTW: In response to the other visitors   we speak excellent French and generally find no problem at all in France.",Disneyland_Paris
139247828,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"ok, dont get me wrong I had a great time but if you can go to America do so. It looks tired and in need of a face lift. When we went a couple of rides were closed due to them being refurbished. August seems a poor time to do this. Also dont worry about the kids bnot being tall enough for the rides the staff couldnt give a hoot. Children as young as 7 getting on the fast rides.",Disneyland_Paris
139173616,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"First     this is FRANCE not AMERICA. The reason staff may have been rude is because of the ignorant, rude English visitors. I saw so many people yapping on in English. They didn   t even say thank you in French. Learn some basic stuff like please, THANK YOU, hello. It will get you a long way believe me. We made mistakes but we didn   t encounter a single rude member of staff and actually, many smiled and were even more helpful because we tried. I was worried about the negative reviews. I am not easily impressed and went with quite low expectations, but, it was for my daughters 7th birthday so we did want it to be good. But, WOW, I was so impressed with the whole experience (yes, minor gripes apart). Planning and preparation is the key to a good experience though.We booked the whole package via Disney   s website. For two adults and a 6 year old we got air flights, coach shuttles to from the hotel, two nights B&B in a Disney hotel (Newport Bay, see separate review), three days unlimited entry to Disneyland Park and Studios for   1200. It   s a lot of money but it seemed a good way to do it.Pre booked shuttle to hotel was orderly and took about 45 minutes to door of hotel. On return in Friday rush hour traffic it was still only about 50 minutes. It would have cost    19 one way each if paid on the day.The park did not look at all run down to me so I can   t see why people are saying that. The only thing I can think of it that Discovery Land probably looked quite space agey 20 years ago but does look dated now. But give it 5 years and it   ll be retro chic!!We were there 11:30am     00;30am day one, 8:30am 8pm day 2 and 8:30am     4pm day three. We got to do all we wanted in the Park and the Studios plus the best rides a second time. We did this by making use of the 8am (8     10 are    golden hours which allow hotel guests in earlier) opening and going to the shortest queues, using the fast pass system and timing things like Armageddon (in the Studios) before the big rush of people came out of the cars stunt show and joined the queue! It can   t be done in a day.People complained they didn   t see the characters walking around. Even if its the case that they used to, it   s primarily a theme park so I can imagine they would get so swamped with autograph hunters etc. There are meet and greet in hotels etc. At 12 noon on first day we sat down just as the characters train came in. It had about 8 characters on who got dropped off at their own spots for meeting children. They also go to the hotels and restaurants for meals if booked etc. There were more benches and places to sit than I have come across (as a non rider) in other parks. There are loads of bins, toilets are a bit hidden but marked on the free map and there are water fountains so water is free if you take a bottle. There was hardly any litter and we saw lots of cleaners, sweepers, gardeners etc about.Toilets     I only had to queue once (in the Studios and only for a minute.). They were only dirty once and it was a bit of over flowed water. Otherwise no toilet issues at all.Food     we ate in the Plaza Gardens t 5pm one day and paid    67 for 2 adult and 1 child buffet and soft drink. Yes it was a bit over priced but we knew that before we went in. It was quiet when we went in but busy when we left. The salad bar was fresh, plentiful and varied. The cooked food on first inspection was chips, sausage, fried chicken etc but more dishes did come out to prepare for the busy period. McDonalds is in the village and will cost    17.    2.50 for a 20cl coffee but with all the water just one or two a day was a treat! BUT, nobody is making you buy the food! We took our own apples, muesli bars, crisps, dried fruit etc. On day one we had sandwiches from home day, one day two foil trays of shop bought meals. Day three we had some sneaky rolls from breakfast! Also, there has been a lot of discussion about whether you can take food in to the park     YES YOU CAN! The security checks are that, for security, e.g. to check you are not taking fireworks or anything silly in. There are not picnic areas in the park though, you have to grab a bench.Strollers     on day one e laughed at older children in the hired strollers. On day two we hired one for our 6 year old!!    8.95 for a full day   s hire was a bargain for a child with energy left to queue and stay up late! You can either pay a    70 deposit to take it off park or drop it back and show receipt to get another one later.Queues and busy rides   We only experienced one incident of attempted queue jumping which I think you would get anywhere. Smoking was not an issue at all and we are sensitive to it if it   s close. We did not experience any technical breakdowns or closed rides.If you want to do Thunder Mountain (its good!) then queue up at entrance to Frontierland at about 9:30 am then leg it when this section opens at 10am!DLP doesn   t offer your big thrill seeker rides or any real water rides for that matter but that just means it   s all more accessible to more of the family.The longest queue was just over an hour for Dumbo, what a waste of time! We just timed it wrong though and should have got there a bit earlier. The queues were no longer than what we had experienced in Legoland here.Eat your lunch in queues if you can, saves valuable time. We had a table booked for 5pm one day which meant we had to miss the parade in the Studios as a result so I wouldn   t bother booking.Non riders     I have back problems so can   t do many rides. If you are a non rider do chores like getting fast passes, top up water bottles, explore the shops without your child in tow (!), take younger children to play areas or just explore the little tucked away interesting places and views. These are sometimes along the exit walk from the rides. The park was busy (it was August school holidays so of course it was) but not    dangerously    so. We were not in a crush of people.Don   t bother with the train. We queued for ages to get it from the back of the park back to the entrance. They let it go each time with loads of seats empty. We could have walked quicker. Not a good view either.We re entered the park on day one at 6:45pm and quite by chance got a kerbside spot by the train station for the 7pm parade. My tip is to view the parade from this end rather than the top end of Main Street by the castle as that was heaving when we did it the next day at 7pm. The characters and princesses princes were smiling and waving like mad and making loads of eye contact with people. Children not smiling got a gesture to and so on, so quite personal given the scale of things.We caught the end of the evening parade at about 10:45pm and were gutted we hadn   t seen it all. It looked wonderful with all the lights. Then we had what seemed like quite a wait for the light show but it wasn   t really, it was just that we were tired. It seemed to go on a bit (again we were tired), but it was brilliant! Absolutely fantastic with flames, lazers, fireworks, fountains, music and lights. It was very busy but because you look up at the castle it   s quite easy to get a good view.Fast passes     one person can queue and get multiple passes issued so if someone isn   t riding get them to do it while the others are. Ideally you need to stay in a hotel at least one night to take advantage of doing an early start or a late night. Things to take     like here the weather is very changeable. Take thin layers and waterproofs, a small umbrella, lots of patience for dealing with your children,( think how tired you are then multiple it for them), snacks, water bottles, camera batteries charger!In total, over three days we did 28 rides shows attractions, 3 parades and the evening light show (between the Park and the Studios) with two afternoon rests back in the hotel and a dip in the hotels pool, Not bad going I would say.I want to give it a 5 star, but its a 4 atar because of 1) the queues, but, then, queues are to be expected, it   s a busy place!! and 2) the price of food is just too overpriced, but again, you don't have to buy it.I would definitely recommend a trip to Disneyland Paris Park and Studios but do your homework, go prepared and speak a bit of French.I'd be really happy to answer any questions, I'm still buzzing about it!",Disneyland_Paris
139169563,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"This has been our third visit (first just my wife and I (2005), second with our then 3 year old daughter (2010), this time with our now 5 year old daughter and 10 month old son). We found that this trip wasn't as enjoyable as our previous ones for a few reasons. This was the first time we visited during the school holidays (the last as well, sorry Mr Gove, I will be taking my children out of school during term time for any subsequent visits). On the first day i had to collect my tickets from one of the booths (I had printed my own vouchers off but needed to exchange them). When I joined an already quite large queue, there were 3 booths open at the front, then in the subsequent 25 minutes or so I was waiting, 2 of these closed (the queue had not shrunk at all in this time), and the one remaining staff member seemed to take an age to serve each customer. The queues were, for most of the rides, massive. this meant that during the average day we were lucky to experience 3 or 4 rides and most of the rest of the time we just ended up walking around soaking up the atmosphere. The heat at times was too much for us, it was usually 27 29C while we were there (we live in the North East of England where anything above 20C is considered warm). One of the things with DLP is the almost complete lack of shade due to there being no tall buildings on the site. On previous visits we have been able to meet many characters who would usually congregate at the bottom of Main Street between 10 11 a.m. and later in the day in front of the castle and various other spots around the park, this time none of this seemed to happen. There were  organised  meeting points, but we preferred the old way (not sure if this is now how it will always be done or if it was just done because of the crowds heat). DLP is a family destination, but on the whole of the site there is just one, dedicated baby change feeding area, this to us is a big minus point. Many families who visit have babies toddlers and it can be quite a chore if little one has an accident at a remote part of the park. DLP is supposed to be a no smoking site (they even have dedicated smoking areas), however most smokers seem to be completely inconsiderate towards all those around them, especially as most of their fellow visitors are children. Overall we found the trip enjoyable but not as much as it has been in the past, we will visit again, probably for the 25th annivesary celebrations.",Disneyland_Paris
139160342,1,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We stayed at Disneyland Paris for 3 days at the end of August and it will definitely be our last visit. We had booked into the Sante Fe Hotel   absolutely dreadful in every respect   in order to benefit from the Magic Hours. However, the number of rides which were not working during the Magic Hours meant the few rides which were working were as overcrowded as at the busiest time of the day. And, of course, it was the most poplar rides which were out of order most frequently.There was no information about what was supposed to be happening after 21.00 and despite waiting until 22.10 for something   anything   to happen on our first evening, we were disappointed and returned to our hotel without knowing what we would miss. I asked a cast member but she seemed as lost as I was.A number of the more popular rides broke down fairly frequently during park opening hours, too. The Fast Pass machines were almost always out of order and led to at least one punch up between customers that I witnessed   nice for my children to see. One machine for the Star Tours ride dispensed one FP followed by an invalid ticket, only to dispense another valid FP followed by an invalid ticket to the next customer. This meant people could not get more FPs as some of their tickets had registered correctly. I gave away the FP I got as I couldn't allow my 11 year old to go on without an adult and try as I might, the FP machine would not accept a second ticket from me. There was rarely a cast members to ask for help. The queues were extremely long and the waiting times given were not accurate.On our day at the Studios, we went immediately to Crush's Coaster, 20 minutes before the park was due to open. The queue was already 45 minutes long and by the time we were half way through an announcement was made to say the ride completely full. I am still unsure what was meant by this but it seemed to imply that the nobody else was allowed to join the existing queue.I cannot fault the cast members who took the roles of the various Disney Characters; they were absolutely marvellous and delighted my six year old niece. The people in the restaurants made an effort to deal with the dairy allergy of one of our group, although they had generally run out of the allergy menu. It was a far cry from Florida where the dairy allergic menu was amazing.The hotel fell far short of our expectations. We have stayed at Disney Hotels in the past and have always been delighted with the accommodation. This time was totally different: the beds were so uncomfortable, my son elected to sleep on the floor: he was the only one who got a decent night's sleep. There was nowhere to hang the hand towels in the bathroom and both of our rooms stank. This was a huge disappointment to us. I have always loved Disney but the Paris Park seems very run down. Avoid it if you can.",Disneyland_Paris

139130161,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Stayed at the Dream Castle Hotel just 5 mins on the free bus from Disneyland.The minute you enter the parks you are on a different planet  Disneyland planet so you have to embrace it inflated charges and all. The drinks and food are way overpriced but you are warned about this before you go, accept that burger and chips and a coke are going to cost twice what you pay in England so budget for it or go hungry or don't go to this place at all. Was impressed with the organisation and attention to detail at Disneyland. Almost all of the staff we talked to were polite and helpful and spoke perfect english. The only staff we saw that were miserable were those stuck on the tills at the fast food restaurants, their jobs were really stressfull. Disney should employ more pople at these places. The size of the place was just right for a short break and the mix of rides between Disneyland and Disney studio was diverse enough to keep you entertained. One of our party was disabled so we were given a disability pass with no problems. This meant a nominal wait at the rides. Be warned those who had to wait the full time this was an hour or more on most rides. The longest wait was for Buz lightyear. Must do with the kids: Crush indoor rollercoaster which is fast, dark, high and thrilling, we went on this 6 times during our stay.Car stunt show with Lightning Mcqueen as the star guest. The stunts are brilliant! Enough to keep the adults enthralled and the kids loved Lightning McQueen.Thunder Mountain great for younger kids and adults. The night time parade   get up high otherwise you will miss it. If you have small youngsters try and get to the front where the carrages stop. Tinkerbell comes out and interacts with the kids. stay for the end of the parade and the fireworks if you can, it is worth it. Be warned however the last busses are packed solid. Not so great when you have very tired young kids.I would go back again there is more than enough to keep you thrilled and entertained from 10am to midnight. Would not do more than 3 days. Just wish we had a young girl in our party, the boys refused to go to sleeping beauty's castle, the most iconic feature of the place.",Disneyland_Paris
139130057,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Where do I even start! I am very disappointed in DIsneyland Paris and would highly suggest they go to Florida for training in how to run a park, motivate staff, keep the parks clean and bring back the magic. One of the first things I noticed was the toilets throughout the park stunk of strong urine, they were very dirty and never did I see staff cleaning them. The park in general was dirty and people were smoking everywhere, no one ever approached them and told them to smoke in the designated areas. I got two fast tracks for two different rides and when it was time to use them both the rides were closed due to technical issues. I only saw Peter pan and Wendy walking around the park and even then they only spoke to each other, they didn't acknowledge anyone around them. The food is like cardboard and exspensive. The place was very cramped and it was hard to find somewhere to sit. Trying to get into the park took ages as the only open about 40 percent of the ticket booths. The lockers didn't work either. I visited DIsney Paris 10 years ago and is was clean and magical, now it's just a dirty park with no spark, staff and management have lost their mojo! my sister was going to book for next year but I have told the family not to bother, instead we are going to save up for Florida and take the kids to where the real magic is. I'm very disappointed in you Disneyland Paris and management should hang their heads in shame.",Disneyland_Paris
139101893,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We had 3 days here and on the first afternoon managed only a train trip and one Star Wars ride the 30 minute wait (on a board outside) was nearer to an hour and once in the queue there was no way out. They have a system of fastpasses where essentially you book to come back later even with this system we waited half an hour when we came back, and many of the attractions have horrendous queues but fast passes aren't available or some sell out by lunchtime so you never get to do it  they need a better system! Also the night light show started about half an hour after the parade ended by which time a lot of people were leaving as they were standing in the cold with kids for all that time very poor organisation!",Disneyland_Paris
139067474,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Sorry to have to say this, but this was a massive disappointment. We were all really excited about going to Disneyland Paris and yes certain things were lovely and magical....thunder mountain, space mountain, star wars, Mississippi steam boat, haunted mansion, the shows (Tarzan & the parades). We are normally positive people and look for the good things but we really struggled with this. We knew it was going to be busy but I have been before in August and I am sure this time they have legally let too many people in! The queues were unbelievable (what they need are more fast pass rides), the amount of rude people was overwhelming (my little boy was getting quite upset at this) and smokers were everywhere (where were the designated smoking areas). However, what ruined it for us was the extortionate price of everything. I can't believe that Disney who used to stand for everyone having equal fun no matter what your circumstances are would deliberately rob you. A bottle of water 3 euros, a horrible meal in the planet hollywood 100 euros....need I go on. Yes you can top your water bottles up in the park but you can't do that in the studios.Sorry but I would advise you don't go unless you enjoy being ripped off.",Disneyland_Paris
139063625,1,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We arrived for 5 days and nights at Disneyland Paris, hoping for the magic that we had experienced 3 years earlier, and we were so disappointed!!! Miserable, bolshy staff, rip off prices and what I would describe as a hatred for English people, this was the worst experience we have had in France ever!!! The staff understand English perfectly well if euros are mentioned or required, but should you raise a concern or complaint, forget it, total lack of customer service, ignorance and rudeness you will never experience anywhere else...... shame really because if they adopted the same mentality as their colleagues in the states then it would be a more pleasurable experience. As others say on here, either save your cash and go to Florida, or go to other parks in Europe.",Disneyland_Paris
139062414,4,2012-8,Portugal,"The Magical Kingdom in all her glory. What impressed me the most is how much effort and dedication has been put into the rides' themes and props, how well maintained everything is and the general atmosphere. With rides that suits all needs.... for adrenaline junkies,  Space Mountain  is a must, and those with younger children and just want to take it slow, there are plenty of other options too. With an abundance of souvenir shops, you can take home a piece of the magic forever.As soon as you step through the gates, you really do feel like you're in a complete fantasy world.However, remember to read the fine print first. Expensive  is an understatement. Apart from the highly priced tickets (starting anywhere from 50     p p), it's another 15    for parking (or more, depending on what type of car you're driving). Food and drinks..... best bring your own! A hamburger, drink and fries: another 15   . And, of course, not to mention if you wish to stay at the hotel. The queues   wow! I don't think there is a  best time  to visit Disneyland to avoid the crowds, so you will just have to grin and bear it. For any ride, you can wait a minimum of 30 45 minutes. For me personally, the large crowd slightly dampened the experience more than the prices.Also, there isn't much coverage..... so if you're waiting in a long queue, chances are you will be waiting in the open. So make sure you are dressed accordingly.Also, something that we weren't quite expecting; we didn't see any of the characters. That was a bit of a disappointment.Although, despite the negative points, I had a really good time with my family, and I will always value the experience!",Disneyland_Paris
139053089,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"This place is all about greed   squeeze people on shuttle buses, load the theme parks to capacity and then take customers eyes out when it comes to meal times!!! struggle to see how anyone can descirbe this place as magical!!?? took our 4 1 2 year old for a 5 nite stay and spent most of that time in queues for rides and food. DO NOT visit the disney princesses attraction   we waited almost 2 hours to meet 1 princess then were asked for 15 euro for a foto. waited on average at least an hour for rides. totally disappointed by the whole experience, staff are not friendly, toilets are dirty, food massively over priced. The nightime show is fantastic but be prepared to pick a good spot at least 45 mins before it starts otherwise you won't be able to see much of it. Also, if you're staying late and are in a hotel outside the main park, the shuttle buses are packed at closing time so as you can imagine it's a rugby scrum. maybe we chose a bad time to visit (end august) but even without the queues it really isn't that impressive   wish we'd saved the pennies to visit the real disney in florida : (",Disneyland_Paris
139045285,1,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We went to eurodisney with our 8 year old and our 2 year old. We usually go to Florida but decided to try Eurodisney. In simple terms.....  we stayed in an on site hotel to get access before the masses but many of the rides are not open in the golden 2 hours, only half the park is available and 2 of the most popular rides suffered 'technical problems' and couldn't be used  Almost all of the staff are awful, miserable and simply don't want to be there  The only food available is burgers, chips, battered fish and pizza and is the same in every restaurant. I recommend you play 'hunt the vegetable...'  The whole place and everything in it is extremely expensive. Child's plastic sword 10 euro. Plastic figure, 16 euro. Child's meal (burger and chips) 12 euro  in our 4 days and 3nights we saw 1 character (Minnie mouse) If you stay on site then the breakfast in the parks is good and the hotel was ok   Nweport bayMy advice? Save up and go to the US.",Disneyland_Paris
139040158,2,2012-8,United States,I book Disney for   200 for the day for our family of four and there was absolutely no value for money at all. During the day we saw absolutely no Disney characters and felt we could have been in any theme park. The shops and restaurants were stupidly overpriced and the only 'ride' the kids enjoyed was the play area! It's a shame Disney are more concerned about making money than entertaining kids. We won't be going back..,Disneyland_Paris
139020986,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,A european sized park with european sized queues! Ok what did I expect? it can get you down after a while though.We found the best things to be parades (get your spot early) and ride around rides like the train   so much to do you will have to visit more than once! Having now done one tour of duty we are eagerly looking at next years calendar to see if we can afford to go again!,Disneyland_Paris
139019893,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We were so excited to take our children to Disney;and, but were quite disappointed. It was no different to any other theme park we've visited. We were expecting there to be a little more 'magic' in the air.The nearest it came to magic was the last parade which started at 10.15pm, this was very pretty and worth staying for",Disneyland_Paris
138993431,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,The 20 years special parades were really good and the light and fireworks show on the castle was one of the best Disney attractions I have seen. Amazing. Only problem was the night time parade started at 10.15pm and the light show at 11.00pm. You got back to the hotel after midnight which was very late for our 6 year old granddaughter.,Disneyland_Paris
138982088,3,2012-8,France,"We have just come back from 2 days at Disneyland Paris and although the children had a great time, and were super patient with the queues (to be expected in August), I have left feeling short changed.1. Adults very agressive in queues to jump ahead and BADLY behaved children trying to do the same and not reprimanded. We had tried to queue for Rapunzel and were told the queue was closed so tried next day....after 10 minutes in queue the new arrivals were told it was closed and went off. 30 minutes late a lady came and pushed her child under the barrier into a space behind me and ahead of others who didnt speak French, so I politely made her aware of situation, and that the other children had already been queueing for 40mins. She left and slid in behind the last family, who were English and couldnt defend themselves so I told her again and eventually the security removed her   do adults have to behave like that??? Most queues were teh same   you had to be premanently on alert and stand 4 wide to prevent queue jumpers   Seriously stressful!!2. Food is extortionate! You dont mind paying over the odds in a theme park but the food is shockingly BAD! We paid 51    for 3 burgers, 1 mangy hot dog, 4 mini chips & 3 drinks!!! It was disgusting! Suggest walking out to diners just outside park to eat or McDonalds on the way home. Nice restaurants like Blue Lagoon were asking 20    35   for main course....3. We had bought the girls 4 tickets (2each) at Auchan so they had an envelope with present of tickets for birthday, and bought our 4 on the day we arrived. No one tells you to keep one half of the ticket to go in and out of park   so did not know to ask when the girl took the evelope and handed us back the 2 intact tickets for the next day...Next day came to check in and were told that the 2 intact tickets had been used the day before!! The girl spoke french but was already on the verge of tears due to stress and when I tried to explain that we her colleague had taken teh tickets the day before and obviously marked these as used too she did not want to understand that there had been a mistake! It turned out she was Dutch but spoke neither English or French well enough or had the will to sort out the problem. Eventually I asked for her supervisor who also did not want to understand that his colleague from the day before must have made a mistake.... He eventually came back from the office to confirm his initial opinion and only that we seriously insisted and had intact tickets in hand he let us through   but not happily!!!4. No characters to be seen.... Only 'Meet Mickey Mouse' building and one stand with Rapunzel   but no characters walking around to sign for kids or for the kids to see   even though they sell Autograph books at EVERY corner!!! You have to pay extra to see characters at breakfast rendezvous....Just to confirm to kids that if you have money you get more in life!!!5. Nighttime parade   all adults and kids sitting along the Main Street waiting and when parade starts all the adults stand up and dont give a damn about kids not being able to see   I thought Disneyland was about the children!! This made me really mad!6. Good points   Space Mountain ride, The Big Thunder Mountain, Train, Area with Dancing teacups was magical, Nightime parade itself, Fire works at end of nightFeel really ripped off in the area of service. No information to be found and VERY few staff wandering around to help guests or answer questions....but rich families with body guards had personal escorts. I really hope our girls did not realise this side of Disneyland Paris   that money gets you everything better and bigger and nicer. All kids should be equal in a place like this or is Disney not magic enough to make us believe that??",Disneyland_Paris
138980253,5,2011-12,United Kingdom,"Just a magical place, thought it was just going to be enjoyable for children but I was wrong! Loved every minute of it! The parades are amazing and a must see! So much to do and see you don't know where to start. Park is always really well looked after. Have been twice (sept and dec) and haven't found either time to be too busy, managed to get on plenty of rides with not a lot of queuing at all. The most we queued was an hour and that was for the nemo ride. Plenty of characters always in the parks. Just brilliant!!",Disneyland_Paris
138949800,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"if you have been to america disney dont bother with this park, its no where near as friendly and its hard to find staff to help. some of the staff were very good whilst others were rude and unhelpful. toilet facilities were a disgrace, smelly and dirty. there is a distinct lack of information and no one to supervise the que jumpers, who seem not to mind trampling small children to get ahead. come on disney get this park up to the american standards particually as the 20 anniversary is on at present. also the fireworks are too late for the little ones, it gets dark earlier now couldnt they do the parade and fireworks later?",Disneyland_Paris
138896758,2,2012-8,Italy,"Have been to Disneyland Paris in mid August, and the park is simply not worth the effort, for 3 main reasons:1) Crowd: although I am aware that August attracts the most people, the crowd and   even more important   the lines to ride the various attractions were just crazy. We basically rode on not more than 5 6 attractions in an entire day, with lines up to 1.5 hours, especially for the most thrilling ones, like Big Thunder Mountain (though more or less that's the same even for other activities   the wait time for children to meet and have a photo with Disney princesses was indicated as 75 mins!2) Overpriced: everything, from the entrance (more than 60    ) to food and souvenirs has just too high a price   again, of course all parks have more or less the same attitude, but spending more than 6 euros for an hot dog (scarse quality bread and a wurstel) is just as crazy3) For 2 (two!) times in a day, rides failed while we were in line (Pirates and Big Thunder Mountain). The result? After spending 30 mins waiting, we had to come back later, of course with double the people in queue   and more hours thrown away. Maybe it was an unlucky day, but I wouldn't be so sure..Conclusion: probably kids will love the setting (I admit it was truly beautiful, pure Disney universe) but the rides for adults are very very limited in number (their  ghost house  wouldn't scare a first grader I'd say), let alone the time spent in line, from tickets to rides to have lunch.Not worth it.",Disneyland_Paris
138882737,5,2012-8,Hungary,Though it is not the same as Disneyland Park in America but still it a wonderful place to be. Nicely maintained attraction park with lot of attractions. You can spend two full days to enjoy all the attractions. We loved to be here and forgot the whole world and enjoyed the disneyworld.,Disneyland_Paris
138875807,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We spent 4 days at Disneyland Pasris during the 2nd week in August. We had never been before so were all excited. We stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne which was great, clean and very friendly staff. Could do with a new lick of paint but for the time we spent in the room cant really moan! The Park itself is amazing. Took my breath away when I walked down Main Street and sw the castle infront of me. The kids eyes nearly popped out of their heads!!! The ques for the rides were anywhere from 20mins for the smaller rides like its a small world to 90mins for the likes of thunder mountain. We took full advantage of the 2 magical hours which hotel guests get from 8am til 10am. Only the Disneyland Park is open during therse hours and while theres only maybe 7 rides open at this time it saved a lot of queing later on in the day. We manged Buzz Lightyear, Orbiitron, Dumbo, Tea Cups, Carosel and Peter Pans Flight during the mornings and pretty much walked straight on. The longest que I stood in was for the princess pavillion which was 75 mins. The wait times are written outside each ride and we found them pretty accurate. 75mins was nothing when I saw my daughters face light up when she met Princess Tiana. Priceless!! Whilst we were there the temp was 38degrees so we drank lots. Water in the park is 3 euros a bottle but I did my research before our trip and took sports bottles for each of us. Nearly every toilet has a water fountain outside and saved us an absolute fortune. For food we went half board. Breakfsst was continental so lots of breads, cheeses and hams but a nice selection of cereals too. I was dubious about the food after reading so many bad reviews but we ate at Annettes Diner in the Disney Village(amazing food, plates stacked full and the kids meals come on a frisbee), The Silver Spur Steakhouse in Frontierland again first class and then Plaza Gardens which was an all you can eat buffet. Plenty to choose from and very nice food. The characters dont walk around but do have designated meeting areas and times throughout the day. Watch the French though as they dont like to que and be prepared to push back. Most character meetings have a que but some are just a free for all and its very much a case of who can push the most. Fully grown adults pushing children out of the way which I found very upsetting. We met Buzz Lightyear, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Princess Tiana and Donald and Daisy duck with about a 20min wait each time. If you can, book the character breakfast. It was fantastic. Each character came round to your table and played, danced and posed for the kids. They signed autographs and we got plenty of pictures. The character breakfast had Mickey, Goofy, Pluto, Eeyore and Chip n Dale. I think we enjoyed it more than the kids! The parade at 7 is a must and stay up late for the fantallusion parade and the light show and firework display. No words to describe it . Were planning on going back in a few years over christams",Disneyland_Paris
138875740,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,Absolutely loved it! Everything made magical especially at night.Queues were the only thing letting it down but what do you expect! Would loved to have spent longer! Would be good to ensure that when getting autographs from the characters children are not pushed out of the way as I had two upset boys who seemed to always miss out because others had pushed in before them and the characters were then whisked away!,Disneyland_Paris
138853279,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,Just returned from disneyland paris with my wife and two boys. aged 3 and 5.Having been here 3yrs previous when it was owned by disney and not by france.We stayed at newprt bay on all meal voucher basis.Hotel room was basic but clean. No free wifi ( most basic hotels now have it for free) It is there but you have to pay.No coffee or tea making facilities in room. Most basic hotels have this also.long wait for breakfast in a morning.Was given a breakfast voucher to use in the park for 8.15am wich says on it character breakfast.Be warned it is not. It is a a way of getting people away from the hotel to cut numbers down for breakfast time.But they do not tell you this. So after getting up very early and get the two boys ready and walk about a mile to the restaurant in the park expecting to see characters and non turn up. We wasnt amused.Meal vouchers were okay but be warned you may still have to pay extra in some places.I paid   35 extra in one place including the vouchers.The park parades have been shortened and do not stop to get out and dance etc.These are now to worth waiting for.Do not do a daytime one then a night time parade either now.Just one at 7.00 pm in disney and 5.00 pm in mgm.ride wait times are about 1hr to 1.30 hrs just to go on basic rides.When they can open both sides or lanes on some rides but are not doing it.Characters are about but alot less than before.Overall we were very disappionted from last time.I think france just want your money and are not bothered. Lets say the magic has gone out of disneyland paris.,Disneyland_Paris
138810941,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"The parks are good, but smaller than Florida and need some more rides. Queues are much longer than Florida taking an hour or over (in August) even for rides for small children. Avoid the taxis at all costs; assuming you can actually get one! Even a hotel transfer of 1 2 miles is a minimum of 15 euros, usually 20 euros each way on the meter. The local taxi drivers are in severe need of regulation and some competition to stop them completely ripping people off. Indeed this is something Disney should have the muscle to apply some pressure locally to correct and need to do so. Four times the price of a longer transfer in central London is not on! We used a Disney hotel (good), but as you get park tickets included on your arrival and leaving days, used another hotel on our first and last night as we had a long journey. Additional taxi transfers (necessary with small children and lots of luggage if using the Eurostar) were so costly we might was well have stayed put, as these and the additional food costs for not having the Disney half board option meant we saved nothing for the inconvenience. Using the Disney half board option for food while in a Disney hotel avoided evening meals completely breaking the bank and allowed us to use a buffet restaurant so we could pin our 4 year old down to actually eating something healthy. Breakfast is also included in the Disney hotels   hence we could get two decent meals a day down my daughter. However, lunch was not included with the half board unless we didn't want an evening meal. Unfortunately lunch options in the parks are very limited, typically costing 20 30 euros just for junk food. Anything better was at least 20 euros a head and we didn   t want that much food. Earl of Sandwich (in Disney Village) was the best option we found for lunch. Unfortunately we found nowhere nearby doing filled baguettes or providing the bits you need to do your own. Again Disney need to take action to provide healthy food options at reasonable prices. Otherwise food, taxi and accommodation costs make Florida a better option. If going again, I would use the car so I could get hold of lunch materials.",Disneyland_Paris
138799194,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Where do i start?! Rude staff, rude people, no magic at all!!Booked a 4 night 5 day stay at Newport Bay as a package through Disney 24th 28th August 2012 for myself, my husband and two teenage daughters. This was our first trip to Disneyland Paris although we have experienced Disney in Florida 5 times. We should have by passed Paris and made it 6! However we thought we'd give it a go with open minds not expecting an exact replica of our fabulous American experiences but at least something akin to them. How wrong we were! The French staff were rude and arrogant as were the people visiting the parks. Numerous times myself and other family members were elbowed or shouldered out of the way without apology. They did not seem to know how to go around you,prefering instead to aim straight for you! None of the staff manning the rides showed any enthusiasm for how they were dressed or where they were, this is Disney for goodness sake,get into character or at least smile!! Forget meeting the characters as it's a general free for all with no staff organising queues and offering to take your picture unlike Florida.On our last night we pre booked a meal in The Blue Lagoon inside the Pirates of The Carribean ride for 9pm . We were 'greeted' at the door by a surly man who informed us the restaurant was closed due to technical difficulties with the ride which made little sense. However there was no attempt to book us in anywhere else, just a shrug of the shoulders as he stepped back at gazed into the distance. I've not experienced that attitude anywhere and was the last thing i expected from Disney. We made our way across a now extra crowded park as people were lining the parade route to City Hall where we were told by another arrogant surly indifferent staff member that every restaurant in the park was booked.On another occasion we we shouted at by a staff member from across the park waving her arms frantically and shaking her head manically because she wanted us to move, polite,not!Park presentation and cleanliness was also an issue for us . Most of the toilets were not cleaned regularly so were messy and smelt bad,with at least 2 in each being unusable because of overflowing or general disgustingness. Although smoking is only supposed to be in designated areas as in Florida, in Paris this is not adhered to,with people even smoking in the queues and no staff monitoring it.This of course meant fag butts eveywhere as well. Night time signage needed checking also with lots of random large Disney letter signage out. For eg the World of Disney shop spelt out WORNEY with the missing letters unlit!On a more complimentary note we were impressed by the variety and quality of food available.We had booked a deal staying at the Disney Newport Bay hotel with all meals included, 4 nights 5 days for four of us for   1400(not inc flight) and considering the food alone would have cost us   900 this i thought was good. The rides and shows were all of Disney standard with reasonable wait times considering the time of year.Some of my points may seem a little picky but considering the Disney corporation push the magical experience theme (which doesn't come cheap) in my opinion that's what they should deliver regardless of which country it's in. The French lack the charm and friendliness of the Americans when it comes to Disney, needless to say we won't be returning to Paris!",Disneyland_Paris
138795286,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"This is the first time we have gone to Disney and my children were so excited. When we arrived the hotel reception staff were brill as were all the staff both in the hotel and around the park, except for the character  body guards  who were quiet abrupt and rude.We stayed in the hotel Sante Fe, it is now really dated and needs a lot of work, get up and in for breakfast early or you will be queing for a long time although the food was really good with a wide variety to suit all tastes. Disney village is designed to shop and eat prices vary greatly cheapest being McDonalds about 21 euros for family of 4 but as with everything else be prepared to que. We did the character breakfast pre booked before we left and although it cost   53 it was worth every penny, the characters were fab and just to see the look of wonder on my children s faces made it.The park itself is magical the parades, the rides, the live shows, meet the characters although some of the rides were a little disappointing for me but my 7 year old children were dumbstruck. You must see the evening parade and fireworks display fantastic.Best show is the cars stunt show WOW.My only quibble about the whole trip is how expensive everything was 5 Euros for a bottle of coke, 4 Euros for a small bottle of water, over 5 Euros for an ice cream,(tip there is a small shop in the train station before you go into the park where you can pick up sandwiches, water, etc for reasonable prices nearer to back home.), also if you take water bottles in with you there are plenty of fresh water drinking fountains where you can fill them up for free.Overall all of us enjoyed the Disney experience get up the park early and stay late this way you avoid most of the big queues and use the free fast pass system for the bigger rides",Disneyland_Paris

Fast passes are a good idea as you get on the rides quicker but you have to walk back to them at a later time, not all rides have fast passes available. The rides are on a par with the American Disney parks, the noticeable difference being on the way in to the ride where the American ones have more to see (and longer queues). We took 3 children 8, 10 & 11, they loved it though were nervous of some of the rides but enjoyed them once they had been on them. Evening parade was spectacular, though we waited over an hour for it to begin. Decided not to wait for the firework display, instead we went back to the car (which took about 20 minutes) and saw them from there   only lasted 2 mins. Get ready for really expensive rubbish food   we spent just under 60 Euro's for inedible 3xburger & chips, 2xhotdog and chips and a drink each. Water, coke, slush drinks are priced at 2.50 Euros so is expensive for a family of 5. Also get ready for extremely rude impatient people (not the staff but the other holiday makers). Other than that, you will have a great time",Disneyland_Paris

138718504,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"First visit with 2 young children and an 11 yr old we borrowed! The aerosmith ride is really good nd lots of the rides for younger children were good fun   a good range for our mixed age group. Space mountain was shut (broken down) for the duration of our trip..Quite a few of the other attractions were also a bit of a let down, for example some of the effects weren't working on the backlot tour. Also on several occasions we had queued for a ride and then it broke down. No fast pass for the people who had been in the queue for 30 mins   frustrating with a very patient 2 year old. Unfortunately this extended to the character signings, you would stand patiently in line and then they would announce that they were finished before you got to the front   no coordinated effort to close queues etc. Final grumble was restaurants, some you can book, some you can't, lack of information anywhere, when you arrive you are herded into a pen like queue with no real order waiting with hungry, tired children (and grandparents) which is no fun for anyone!",Disneyland_Paris

138668085,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We visited Disneyland Park as part of a two park day hopper ticket. Unlike what others have said on here, I bought tickets online and the paper I printed out clearly said  This is a ticket  and it was indeed a ticket   we used it to go straight to the entrances of both parks.We did Disneyland Park second, as it stays open later compared to the studios. It was definitely the better one of the two parks and if I had to choose, I'd rather just to Disneyland Park (we are a young couple with no kids).Some of the facilities could have been a bit cleaner and it was also exceptionally crowded. Despite being out from 10am to 9pm, we can probably count the number of rides we did on two hands. We used fast passes wherever possible and tried to plan, but you still end up getting stuck in queues everywhere.All in all, a good day out. I was wondering beforehand if you could do two parks in one day, and it's definitely possible if you have the ENTIRE day available. We did our first ride at 11am and our last one at 9pm   we did most of the  have to do  ones, so it can be done, as long as you plan.",Disneyland_Paris

138662019,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We stayed at the Davy Crockett Ranch at Disneyland Paris in August 2012   4 adults and 2 children aged 6 and almost 3. It was interesting to compare as I visited the park when it was still 'Eurodisney' back when it first opened. It seemed as though standards of cleanliness and staffing had gown downhill.Biggest gripe: Smoking is supposed to be prohibited other than in designated areas. But no one seems to check and people were smoking all over the place   including in the queues, in restriced space. It was unpleasant in such a supposedly family friendly environment. (Another potentially big gripe   what is the point of the bag checks? The security staff were giving the bags a cursory check   anything could have been smuggled in under buggies as these weren't checked.)More minor gripes:Ok, so if you go to Disneyland in the middle of August, you expect to queue. But the queues were incredibly restrictive with young children (90 minutes and more for the most popular rides). As we were staying at a Disneyland resort we thought we would be able to benefit from the early opening time for guests. But although the park itself opens for guests at 8am, very few rides open until gone 9 o clock and most open at 10, when the crowds start to come in. We did manage to get on some of the rides in Fantasyland early on, but so much more could be done to accommodate guests in the two hour period between 8 and 10. Information as to which rides open early on which days could be made much clearer. Rides could open earlier. Many of the drinks stands also remain closed for a long time   once we were inside Fantasyland early in the morning, there was nowhere to buy a coffee. When they did open, rides were not being used to their capacity   on the It's a Small World ride at around 10.15 one morning, two boats were going around empty for every one that was filled   even though there was still a queue of people whose wait could have been minimised. On the Pinocchio ride, seats were left empty (three people were being sent around in carts which can accommodate at least 6) despite there being a 20 minute queue. It's particularly disappointing that the Studio Park doesn't open early. We managed to get around most of the suitable rides in the Disneyland Park (in Fantasyland at least) over the 4 day stay, though taking advantage of the (limited) early opening. As we were unable to do the same in the Studio Park, we chose not to join the 30 min minimum queues in the middle of the day for any of the rides in the Toy Story area. It's also made to look as though the Toy Story area contains a playground. It doesn't. Our children enjoyed the play areas in the main Disneyland park (eg in AdventureLand and the Pochohontas playground in Frontierland). It would be good though if such areas could be increased enlarged to accommodate people whose children are too young to stand in queues of an hour and more. Crowds leaving the parade area around 7.30 are dangerous and badly directed by staff. Based on earlier experience we knew that food prices are prohibitive (which was one of the reasons we chose the Davy Crockett ranch so we could self cater). It remains the case that food is over priced and of poor quality. Avoid if you can.PositivesDespite the gripes our two children still had lots of fun and they loved the parade at 7pm. It's disappointing again though that there aren't more parades. The best thing about the break was the accommodation. We'd definitely recommend the Davy Crockett ranch. One junction down the A4 towards Paris, it was so good to get away from the parks in the peak of the day (we got into the parks early, had 3 4 hours there and came back for lunch before heading back for the parade at 7). The 'bungalows' at the ranch were basic but clean, with adequate faciliites for cooking (no ovens but we knew this in advance and planned meals accordingly). The ranch site itself was great with plenty for us to do   big pool, mini golf, archery, pony rides   there was also a Robin Hood evening on our last evening with dancing and archery   the children loved this. Staff at the ranch were extremely friendly and helpful   much more so than the staff working in the parks themselves. Advice   if you're staying at one of the Disneyland resorts get in early and make the most of what early opening there is   though check what rides are open (there's an Information board in the area in front of the castle) and be aware that most rides will remain closed until 10. Self cater if possible! You can bring picnics but can't eat them in the park itself; there's a picnic area just outside. It's worth knowing that sandwiches and coffee at the train station (right outside the entrance to the parks) are much better value and quality than anything in Disneyland itself. Be prepared for long walks   the path from the car parks to the parks themselves is very long (though there are travelators).Make the most of areas that don't necessarily involve queues   there's lots to explore in Adventure Land   caves bridges the cabin of Swiss Family Robinson   which can be done after you've been on some of the rides.",Disneyland_Paris
138633265,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Having been several times now and am never disappointed. The parades and nightime fireworks are really worth seeing. Be sure to get fasttrack tickets for Buzz Lightyear and Space Mountain, they are not to be missed. Pirates of the Carribean and the Haunted Mansion are a little out of the way and don't ten to have the longest queues, so make a point of going on these too.",Disneyland_Paris
138632479,3,2012-7,Greece,"I 've been twice in the Disneys' Parks in Orlando, Florida, in 1991 and 1995. This time I took the opportunity, visiting Paris, to take my kids to have the experience of Eurodisney, as they wanted it so much. I was warned from friends about large queues. But I could not imagine, that for every main attraction (except the Small World) the queue had to be 60 minutes!!! But let 's take it from the start. We arrived there at noon. To get inside, you have to pass the parking. The parking costs 15 Euros, something quite expensive for just an open air parking. From there you have to walk a lot to get in the park and there are moving corridors, but some of them don 't work. Then and while you haven 't got in the park, there is a welcome message in English and French, which is the same the whole day (even at midnight...) and you listen to it several times, becoming annoying. After a quite long walk (at least 10 minutes) you reach the entrance of the park. I payed 57 Euros for the adults (over 11 years, also for my 13 years old daughter!), prepayed in my hotel (the normal price for 1 park was 61 Euros). Getting inside having a ticket is easy. The first thing I thought getting inside is, what this American thing has to do with Europe. The Main Street you 'll find in front of you is a replica of an old town in USA. So it 's something out of the European culture. OK, you 'll tell me this is money, the American way of thinking! And it surely is!!! There are a lot of people getting around, with a lot of kids (this place is for them). Getting around didn 't impress me, except from how they changed the place making the lake with the river boat and the changes to a small jungle. The Disney company protected the environment quite well, as there is a forest there, something which you can see if you take the train making the round of the park (but we waited for it 40 minutes, instead of 30 that the sign wrote...). We had the opportunity to see rabbits in their actual environment. As I said, all the main attractions (Pirates of the Carribean, Toys Lazer Show, Peter Pan and others) had a 60 minutes queue. So we saw none of them, as nobody of us could stand being on the line for that long; it 's just silly. The Small World is nice, but normally is just for kids. There were 2 parades, one at 7 p.m. and one at night, at 10:30 p.m. They were nice and fancy (especially the night one with the lights). They could surely find a better music theme for the afternoon parade. As the park celebrated this year its 20th birthday, they had a special show at night at the castle of the Sleeping Beauty with video effects, fires, steams, waters, lazer and fireworks. It started at 11:00 p.m. and has a duration of 20 minutes. It 's nice and spectacular, but it starts very late and the most of the people and especially the kids are very tired at this time. In Orlando these shows (because the dark begins there earlier) begin at 9:00 p.m. and this is a better time. And another bad thing was, that I had to raise a lot of times my 10 years old daughter so as to see, as she could not see well with so many people standing, as the show wasn 't only fireworks high in the sky, but took place also in the low parts of the castle, and this is a minus, which haven 't been thought from the people who designed it. So after the show this crowd of tired people (notice that a lot of kids normally aren 't awake at that time and so the parents had to carry them asleep) have to make a large walk back to the cars or to the train to get back home. This is showing, that they thought only of money putting the park in the Paris area and not the people... And all this for getting into a luna park... The food was expensive and the most souvenirs are overpriced. I could not believe in my eyes, that there is no restaurant outside Disneyland, as there are a lot in Orlando. So the only choice you have, if you haven 't brought some sandwiches, is to eat there. You can 't of course expect the food to be something special, as they have to serve large crowds. So fast food is what you expect to find. The toilet where I went was clean enough for such crowds. There are only 2 3 points, where you can drink water free. Because of the tiredness, the half of the people of our company (we were 8) couldn 't stand to see the night shows. So we had to go back to our hotel and then drive back again for it. This was twice the routes with the corridors and all these. A good way to lose weight, but not suitable for a lot of people and kids. So, in conclusion, you give a lot of money for getting so tired and this is very annoying to me. They had to follow another financial policy for just a luna park. The whole thing can cost you for a family of 4, together with food and souvenirs, over 300 Euros, which are a lot of money, and they don 't deserve it.",Disneyland_Paris
138598987,2,2012-8,Canada,"I am a big fan of disney parks having visited disneyland in Los Angeles and Disneyworld in Florida five times tbhroughout my liife. And each time and at different ages I was always impressed with the high quality of the park amenities as well as service. These parks were always spolessly clean, had great service by staff and I always had a great time.So when visiting Disneyland in France it was a huge let down. Right from the entrance which was dirty and disheveled with garbage and cigarette butts on the ground plus worn unpainted dirty surfaces. Then we had to get into a huge slow queue to get tickets in exchange for our online purchase certificate.( We should not have to do this that is why you purhase online.)The staff was unhelpful and indifferent. The park and rides and food establishments were all seedy and run down. We ate an expensive meal at one of the restaurants where you can make a reservation. The food was good, but the service was lacking. And the upkeep of the dining room and washrooms was really lacking. There was cracked tiling, worn suraces, poorly painted finish, garbage on the floors. In the the other Disney parks not one of these things would be found. Every detail is taken care of. Thats what makes real Disney :Parks so magical and wonderful. Unfortunately this is not a real Disneyland!!!",Disneyland_Paris
138588745,4,2012-8,Guernsey,"We have visited all of the other Disney parks around the world and had left the closest one to home until last. Its a very different experience from the American one. we were there mid august and it was VERY busy so some forward planning is essential, decide what you want to do and get fast passes whenever you are able. If you are at a Disney hotel you can enjoy the magic hour before the park opens to the general public but beware very few rides are open in this hour and you are prevented from getting to the rides that aren't open until 10 o'clock. There was a distinct lack of staff, hardly any signs pointing you to the most popular rides and a lot of the stands selling merchandise, drinks, ice creams etc were regularly closed at peak times...again presumably due to lack of staff. Some areas of the park closed earlier than others and the staff were rather rude in shepperding people away from those areas, especially after the parade. But, all in all, we had a great time and a week later back at home we are all still singing the song from the parade...thats what disney is all about!",Disneyland_Paris
138543593,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We're a mature couple, we were staying in a chateau for my wife's birthday and as Disney was about an hour's drive away, I'd planned for us to visit there (for a bit of fun) and pre booked the tickets vouchers through Tesco which saved about   40. So, queued for 10 mins. to be told the vouchers had to be exchanged for tickets, queued for 30 mins. Armed with the tickets, decided to visit the  film studios  park first, visited 2 sets, where we queued for approx. an hour each Armageddon was good, apart from the boring intro. The next, a themed ride, showing bits and pieces from various films, which apart from a  tidal wave  and an  explosion  was a waste of time. The  stuntshow , having queued and sat down for another 25 mins. the show was cancelled  due to un forseen circumstances . We then headed for the theme park. First queue was to take the train to see the park. The queueing notice says, 45 mins. at the bottom of the stairs, the queue was a lot shorter approx. 20 mins. After 30 mins, we were still only half way to the platform, unfortunately, this is when, probably through the heat and a lack of seating when queueing, my wife feinted and collapsed, and was rushed to the infirmary, where she was attended to, by a nurse and doctor, given an ECG, blood and heart tests all within 15 mins. of arriving, (ten out of ten). Some 21 2 hours, we were able to leave, the nurse recommended  All you can eat buffet  restaurant, for quality food. To be fair, the food was high quality, but should be at   47 for two. The rest of the time we meandered around the park, not daring to queue and left just before the firework display, to avoid the crush on leaving. We've been to Disney, Florida several times, along with all the other parks they have over there, Paris is a very poor relation, it's very expensive, the queues are too long, and most of the work force are miserable. I'm still trying to work out the queueing and allocation of seats on some of the rides as it seems only the French could come up with some of the systems but if you're going to be ill, that's the place.",Disneyland_Paris
138520058,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"When one thinks of 'Disneyland Paris', one sees a true haven, heaven for the kids with magic bouncing off the walls like rainbows after sunlight breaks through a monsoon, and a place for adults to also, somehow get enjoyment out of the place too, and you all go skipping down the promenade holding hands while some beautiful music softly plays out of the tannoys.Stop right there, my friend. This is all a dream. Welcome to reality, and Disneyland Paris just doesn't cut it. We as a family, me aged 17, my sister aged 5, and my mum and stepdad went out there for a two day break (Friday and Saturday), as we were travelling from Center Parcs near to Laon on the Friday, the first day was really just a half day as we needed to do the one million things that come along with travelling and arriving. But enough of the tangent, this is our experience.We arrived on Friday afternoon, and we went in straight away after parking the car. Little did we know that there was going to be a huge walk to actually get into the park, even when you're parked in 'Zone A'. Annoying. However the travellators do take some of the weight off of your feet but only temporarily as more pressure is piled on when you hear the out of date, tacky music that is played at probably 100dB right above your ears when entering the park, of which I'm sure is a health and safety risk. Oh and how could I forget? Every minute or so a 'Welcome' message is played as well! A nausiating voice, in French and English will annoy you hugely while you enter. You'll probably be able to recite the lines upon entry, and not just in English!About the park, I feel over the years it has been slowly let to become just a generally tacky place, and what I find interesting is that this year it's the 'Twenty year celebrations', and part of me wonders if some of the places haven't been seen to since 1992! The rides, however are actually quite good and still cater for all of the age groups, for example children can still live out dreams in 'Fantasyland', whether they are male or female, or the boys can pretend they're still a cowboy in the 'Wild Wild West', in 'Frontierland', yee haw. These are just to name a few of the fantasies that can be lived out by your children, but it comes at a price..Example, take the image that I have just shown you, go on imagine it, you have my permission. Okay, now add lots of people. No no, more than that. Nope, still more than that! Okay if you need an idea, just add everyone who visits Oxford Street, Westfield London West and Westfield Stratford, on a Saturday, in the school holidays. Bingo! You've got enough people now in this vision. Make sure you've got enough crying babies, toddlers, screaming parents and arguments galore, add a hot Summer's day if you wish and your image is complete. Serve with a garnish of stress. This, dear reader is how crowded the place gets. I can understand why though, but there are limits, and I fear that this is the limit. The sheer volume of people on the site at one time can be bordering among the dangerous, an example of this being every five seconds, you are bound to hit another family and be saying 'Sorry' in about seven different languages. If you have small children also, well this can be made even worse, as some people I saw in the park completely disregard anyone, and your child, or children for that matter stand a high risk of ending up in the back of an ambulance after 'Mr. I don't care about anyone within a 100m radius of me' knocks into you, or your child, causing distress and injury. Getting onto any ride, even past ten 'o' clock is misery served on ice. What is even worse is the fact that some people have the cheek to push past you in the queues! This happened to me, as first hand experience and so I was in a battle for one space against four other people, in a queue. How sad it is. The average queue time for any ride after about an hour after opening is 60 minutes plus, sometimes even up to 90. So if you like queuing, by all means get down to Disneyland now! However, if you don't like most people..I want to move on now to the prices of some things once you're inside the park. To sum it up in a sentence, once you're in the park, you are essentially prisoner, at mercy to the owners of Disneyland. Bring half the contents of your bank account, because 98% of the time you'll be using it all up. Food there is a joke, to say the least. Unless you want to have a small bite and dare to venture into some of the 'themed' places Disneyland offer internally, you're going to be stung. Badly. A main meal? I know some places in London where you can get a good quality meal for   15 a head, sometimes more sometimes less dependent what you get, but all with plenty of food so you don't go home hungry. At Disneyland? Ahem. Just for a main meal, 20 euros minimum. Or if you look around and not eat as much, 10 and 14 euros as a bracket. You would expect the quality to be great wouldn't you considering the price? Think again. I forked out 14 euros for a pizza meal, of which promised me a four cheese pizza, a side salad, tiramisu and a drink. Anyone with the least of distingushed pallets could tell you that the pizza was probably made out of only two cheeses. And the quality of the rest of the food is just, to be frank dire for what one expects for the money. At least the tiramisu cheered me up a bit. 'Own some of the magic!' I hear Disney cry, now. What they don't mention is that to own 'some of the magic', you need to fork out pathetic amounts of money to actually obtain it. Items of clothing, if you expect to go there to buy some new clothes and bring not much else, you're going to be strutting around in your birthday suit, unless you have a golden credit card. A themed T Shirt, for example costed 35 euros. Excuse me? I could eat out with 'Mon amour' for cheaper! If I had one. Even a balloon with Mickey or Minnie Mouse on it costs 7.50 euros. How disgusting is that when you as an adult will fully know that the balloons probably get made for about seven cents! It's just sad though, I feel personally that Disney need to charge so much for everything once you're inside the park and it is a true disgrace.Lastly the parades, of which run nightly. Most nights, or even every night there is one parade at 7pm, of which features the main characters that Mr. Disney created many years ago, and also the masterminds of today. Be severely warned. I arranged to meet my mum and little sister near to the entrance of the park about ten minutes before the parade begun, as they had gone home for the afternoon and I wanted to sieze the opportunity to, hopefully be impressed by Disneyland that afternoon. I had to get back from one side of the park to the other to do so and as one expects, the journey shouldn't be too bad, right? Wrong. The time came around when I was to meet with my mum and sister, only to be met by a brick wall of, what felt like two thousand people, sealing off any exit point to attempt to get to my parents. I was lucky though, I got through in the end and this was for two reasons;1. I live near London, and I often spend a lot of time on the tube, meaning I'm used to the general commute and running through places at speed.2. I was on my own at that point.If I wasn't on my own, I wouldn't have made it back to my mum, purely because it would have been impossible circumnavigating a tide of stressed parents with small children, simple. Once I got back to my loving family, I was greeted with a sight where people had been sitting, or standing right against the kerb to get the best view of the men and women in funny costumes, of which was just amazing to see. Amazing for Disney, obviously as they are rolling in the money, amazing for me and my sister as she couldn't see anything, just a sea of legs and shorts. In theory this idea could work though of having so many people, and work quite well, but the staff just got it all wrong, encouraging people to stand up, and actually arguing with them if they didn't stand. It doesn't take a genius to work out that when you have that volume of people you can't have the first two rows of people standing! Pathetic. I felt the need to lift my sister onto my shoulders as I love her very much, like a brother should so that she could see everything, and she got the enjoyment out of it that she deserved. The sad fact is though is that they only had one parade on a day, at 7pm. I find this a bit sad as you should 'give something for the fans that paid to get in', and do more parades a day, please? For what you get, however if you do decide to fork out the money to come here it just doesn't step up to the mark. My sister was just overwhelmed by the amount of people that were in the park at one time, and in fact it was too much for her, and I just suspect some other young children would find the whole attraction too much. If you want to own some of the cheaply made magic that'll cost you 25 euros and last about a week, then go on. If you want to overpay for some cheap and nasty food where you're NOT allowed to have a picnic once inside the park, then go on. If you want a day where you'll be constantly bumped into, knocked out of the way or even onto the ground, where you're surrounded by children having tantrums because they can't have the candy floss which costs 4 euros, and then wait in a queue for a ride for 90 minutes that lasts 90 seconds, then go on! UK attractions such as 'Thorpe Park' and 'Alton Towers' have really overtaken Disneyland over the last five years, and unfortunately Disneyland has been left in the dust, coughing and spluttering. Be warned.",Disneyland_Paris

138453217,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,Much like other reviewers we were not impressed and i'm usually an ardent Disney fan who sees through the rubbish because of Mickey! The only Disney magic is that that you create yourself   it was seriously lacking. I did expect it to be busy but it was heaving. The late night parade and show were positively dangerous despite staff trying to keep order   i suppose its a financial thing  cutbacks mean less staff. Most of the staff lacked any enthusiasm anyway and didn' t keep any order so people pushed and shoved   very rude. All queuing signage was very very inaccurate   the first ride we tried said 15 mins and it was actually over an hour. The staff were just not paying attention and organising things. The toilets were disgusting   everyone i went in even in the morning they smelt. Food was ok but very expensive and again service was just not organised so queueing was a pain. I personally wouldn't go back again   its just not Disney any more its commercialise disappointment.,Disneyland_Paris
138449255,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,The Park was really busy during August as you would expect. Queues of 1.5 hours typical. Would suggest at least 2 full days needed. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was quiet early in the day. The yound childrens rides were quieter. We watched the parade at 7pm near to the Buzz Lightyear attraction and this was a really good spot. The Park certainly gets busier as the day goes on.,Disneyland_Paris

138380911,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We came here first at Easter time 6 years ago and I always wanted to come back. So this year we came back with a party of four. Compared to before, the place was absolutely heaving. This overcrowding, and the heat, made the visit really much less than magical. As we weren't in a Disney hotel, we couldn't get in early so we found it worked best to start late and visit late afternoon into evening. My daughter hadn't been before and she had the same experience as I did 6 years ago   disappointment that such attractive looking shops weren't real shops, just multiple places hawking the same Disney souvenirs. The pricing of the meals and the merchandise is absolutely shameless. The Champs Elysees felt like going to the sales in comparison! If you have young children, I would really try to come out of season if you can. If they are under 4 it is probably not worth the effort and expense. My 3 year old grandson was happiest in the Pocahontas village which is just a good old fashioned playground. BUT...It's Disneyland. Everyone should do it, at least once! And I'm glad that I finally got to go on Pirates of the Caribbean!",Disneyland_Paris
138358807,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Just got back from the trip   what a let down. Toilets were filthy, they just kept letting people in & children were getting crushed. Queues for over an hour, we were lucky to get 4 rides a day. Not much fun when the trip cost over   4,000. The fast passes only work in the mornings and the extra hours consist of very few rides. The customer service was rubbish. I've been four times over the last five years and the 15th anniversary was brilliant, now it just seems they want to take your money by cashing in on our children's dreams. Won't be back!",Disneyland_Paris

Park staff are utterly useless.",Disneyland_Paris
138338424,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from Disneyland Paris for the 5th and probably the last time. This year the park was distinctly lacking in special magic. It's meant to be the 20th anniversary, and whilst you still get the excitement when you enter Main Street USA, as the day progressed, so did our enthusiasm, We have always travelled in August, and accepted it would be busy, but busy does not in any way describe what the parks were like this year! Hectic and seriously overcrowded would be better words. I couldnt help wonder if they had a maximum capacity. If they had, they must have seriously exceeded it. Several of the rides were broken during our trip, the toilets were absolutely filthy all round the park, and some ( definately not all!) of the staff were downright rude, and clearly didnt like their job. The parades were chaos, and some adults were simpy pushing people over to get a spot for themselves and their children. One time, my 77 year old father was physically pushed out of the way by a father who wanted to get their child to the front. I was horrified and as I speak French, I was able to communicate my annoyance.On all previous trips, we have seen an abundance of characters around the park. This year, they were very limited and when they did appear on the 20th anniversary train during the day, you couldnt get near them! Is that why very few come out because they are scared of being bundled??Key asset to have here is PATIENCE! Some europeans like to push and ignore queues and those that do sometimes queue often smoke and think nothing of blowing their smoke right in your face! Message to Disney Management   go visit the other Disney Parks around the world and smarten Disneyland Paris up in order to bring the special magic back!",Disneyland_Paris
138324576,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We spent a Wednesday pm to a Friday pm last week (so 2 days) with a 7 and 11 yr old.2 days was was about the right length of time for us. Went on most the rides the kids wanted to. Could have spent a 3rd day and done a few of the shows and gone on a few other rides but it was v busy, hot and tiring   the kids left v happy.If you can...  start early in the mornings! We stayed at a hotel which entitled you to an extra hour in the Disney Park (not the studios) from 9am to 10am (though i think only in Discoveryland).  they rope off certain areas and it appears everyone is having to wait until 10am but find a staff member (who will be patrolling the roped area) flash your hotel pass to bypass and get into Discoveryland. We went on spacemountain 5 times with no queues whereas later in the day up to 75 mins!  we then shot over to the Indiana Jones ride when this opened at about 10 and again got 5 rides on this (could have had more but whiplash started to kick in!)  Use fast passes (it's free!) and massively cuts down queue times. Each park ticket can only have 1 ride allocated to it at a time (with an allocated ride time). Once the allocated time has passed (whether you go on the ride or not) you can then allocate another ride time to your ticket. We were fortunate and had 10 in our party so could allocate a few different rides across the 10 tickets (because not everyone in our party wanted to go on the rides and Disney didn't appear to care whether a fastpass was allocated to a child adult  a long day but stay late as again got quieter after 9pm (and the parade at about 10pm then the fireworks on the main castle at about 11pm are fantastic)  the mid afternoon is manic. Really busy so we went to hotel for few hours and swam   had lunch etc on 1 day and then didn't bother queuing for anything 2nd day but just took in the atmosphere and went on some of smaller attractions (Robinson Crusoe walk and caves near there were fun)   now i'm not tight but....we purchased water drinks etc from UK and carried with us as pretty expensive and you get through soooo much as was hot and tiring. Though it has to be said there are loads of food drinks outlets so you don't have to queue for refreshments.  we went on the Hollywood Hotel ride as said 45 mins wait (the max i was ever willing to wait). Actually took about 100 mins due to 'technical problems'! (ride was v good but no way worth that wait) Went back next day for another go as appeared less busy in Park on the Friday, and it said 30 mins wait. I queried the time with member of staff pointing out the previous days experience, and he was v apologetic and let us go straight through the fastpass queue so was on the ride within 5 mins   v nice touch!",Disneyland_Paris

138270758,4,2012-8,United States,"Just visited Disneyland Paris for the second time in August 2012. There are two parks, Disneyland and Disney Studios. Disneyland is similar to Florida and California, but with some attractions not currently at the other parks, the Indiana Jones ride, for one, and a great pirate ship near Pirates of the Carribbean. Take a full day for this park, it can be crowded. As for Disney Studios, for us it does not offer a full days worth of activities. We spent about 2 hours there because we don't do roller coasters or Tower of Terror. You could probably spend a full day there if you like those kind of rides. They also have Disney Village like in Florida and California with loads of shopping and restaurants. Lots of fun for anyone who loves Disney.",Disneyland_Paris
138258494,5,2012-8,United States,We loved the themes and everything was magic. Funny all the shops had Disney merchandise?  Perhaps a few areas for the kids to see the parades without parents shoving telephoto lenses up the little ones nose!!,Disneyland_Paris
138222080,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We visited here 4 years ago in October and had a great time. However, in mid  August the magic has largely gone. Whilst the rides are good, the queues are so long that you can only manage 4 or 5 in a day. Also   200 for the day for a family of 4 is really steep.",Disneyland_Paris
138220960,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Having done Disneyland with the children a few times (been there, done that, got the ears!), I have to say, it is also fun as a couple. 60 year olds, kids at heart, we had great fun   loved the roller coasters   especially the Rock and Roller coaster   worth several visits, and just the sheer detail of everything. OK   it is false, and artificial, but surely that is the whole idea   natural beauty can never be beaten, but this place is a tribute to man's imagination and technical skills. Excited children all around in the morning, grizzly and bad tempered though in the afternoon   a shame for parents who have paid so much, The queues are a pain, but what can they do? What a shame the staff were surly though   what happened to the 'smile   you are going on stage' motto?",Disneyland_Paris

138196094,4,2012-8,France,"Yes, i went there again and again! I do not believe that i still enjoy the ride of thunder mountain, space mountain, and the rock'n roll coaster Aerosmith. Pump up your adrenalin with those attractions for maximum 5 minutes, you feel young all the time! or you puke! : ))Disneys keeps the cleanliness of all the rest rooms. Consumption for the beverages is affordable, so for tight budget no need to bring drinks from home ; p. Fast foods in studio disney are surprisingly much more delicious than MacD. The merchandising like t' shirts, Jackets are unbelievably have good quality though we know the workers are poorly paid. Yesss... as always a very long queue and a big PATIENCE are absolutely NEEDED! Take 2 days pass to enjoy all!",Disneyland_Paris
138179444,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"I have just returned from Disneyland Paris with my husband and three children. We spent a full day in the park from 10am to 9.30pm and there was plenty to see and do. Unfortunately the downside would be the humongous queues for practically everything. A total blessing has to be the Fast Pass system that allows users priority entrance to the rides and little or no queue. In some cases we had to queue for 10 15 minutes in order to get the Fast Pass but this was nothing in comparison to the 75 and 90 minute queues for the major rides! I would definitely not return to Disneyland in August as you waste a considerable amount of time queuing and after the huge expense for the tickets I believe that at other times of the year you would probably get more for your money.The cost of food and drink should be carefully considered as we spent a fortune during the two days that we spent at the Parks. I would definitely take food in as prices are extortionate! We ate at Plaza Gardens Restaurant on Main Street which is Buffet style; again not cheap, but a good variety of food available that we all enjoyed.I was also disappointed that we didn't see many characters walking around and the queue to see a Disney Princess was 90 minutes!! Hugely disappointing given the revenue on one days' entry to the park, I am sure that this could be better organised.My highlight and 'must see' is the Tarzan stage show which was spectacular. It actually gave me goosebumps...I know big kid right?! The park guides are available at the park entrance and will help you to plan the day to fit around the shows and parade.All in all, we had a great day which could have been even better with an improvement to the parks management; however I have three happy children so my mission has been completed!",Disneyland_Paris
138177365,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"As a party of 5, we have just returned from Disneyland Paris. There are still plenty of positives (we still had a lovely time), although DLRP must realise that there are some issues that need urgent adressing. Austerity or not, if they are going to charge premium rate prices, they have to make sure they offer a first class service.RIDESThoroughly love  It's a Small World  and  Pirates of the Caribbean , especially on hot days! Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast fun, but aiming seemed to be hit or miss depending on which spaceship you had.We all enjoyed most of the roller coaster rides, but I still harp back to the days of the original space mountain. I just remember it being the most incredible ride with the music accompanying it so took my young sister on it... Head banging is how I best describe it now   I don't buy the idea that a trip to space is meant to be so rough... surely a ride should be enjoyable.Thunder Mountain was our favourite, but the game we played for our trip was guessing whether it would be open or closed...  Probleme Technique  occurring at least twice daily surely should be sending alarm bells ringing if I was an DLRP engineer.Feeling is that they need at least two more rides akin to Thunder Mountain (minus all the technical problems), as they have a real issue with...QUEUES!!It may have been hot and during the school summer holiday, but the place was heaving. Seeing young children in distress does not make for pleasant viewing which begged the question of whether the park had a maximum capacity. We were incredibly fortunate to make the most of the fastpass system, but seeing main queue lines for 90minutes  is simply unacceptable.Now comes a real annoyance   queue jumping I'm sad to say by the French is shocking. I mean, all shapes and sizes, young and old, will try to simply skip queues. What's worse is that it seems to be universally accepted by staff. They have to start using a zero tolerance approach, otherwise things could have easily boiled over in the hot weather conditions.We did our token bit to stop it   at  Pirates of the Caribbean  I had a French teenager standing so close behind that my initial thought was he has trying to steal something from backpack so took it off and carried it. We moved as a family in a line so he couldn't get past during our queue time. He then made the unfortunate mistake of calling us  les rosbifs , which for those unsure is derogatory slang that the French use to call the British. With a couple of us being able to speak French, it took great pleasure to tell him exactly what we thought of his attitude... He shut up after that!SMOKING!!Why not ban it from the Park? The designated smoking areas were not being used, so smokers just had free reign everywhere apart from indoors. Again, nearly all staff didn't take action to apprehend smokers apart from one outside the Peter Pan queue (who got a massive round of applause)TOILETSErm... lets just say that they should come with a health warning   absolutely foul. No further explanation required.STAFFThey have come in for plenty of stick in the past for not being  Disney like , but from our experience they were mostly very helpful and positive. Just need to take firmer action against smokers and queue jumpers.SHOPSMostly overpriced nonsense, but I bought a t shirt for my young sister for 10 Euros which was not too bad. Seemed to be so many outlets in the Park when they could do with some more rides.BEST ADVICE1. Have a clear plan for your day   plenty of walking involved!2. Use the fastpass system for Thunder Mountain Buzz Peter Pan, and go on other rides in between3. Make the effort to speak French   you will notice a difference in the level of helpfulness (although I appreciate that this shouldn't affect customer service for a holiday destination)In summary, I know we will go back, but I sorely hope that someone, somewhere at DLRP will take the action to improve the park so that it can at least come closer to their counterparts around the world.",Disneyland_Paris

Longest lines we have ever seen (on the rides that were open). Not many staff members around. Lots of people were having problems using the FastPass machines and there was no one in sight to help. This happened on more than one occasion.I definitely agree with another review I saw here. Most visitors to this park have bad queue etiquette! Pushing you in the back, pushing in, standing way too close.... Argh! And yes smoking!Disneyland Tokyo was by far the best Disneyland of them all.

By this time we had lost the will to live.The park has far to many customer, the queues for food were so long we could not get any so ended up with a box of popcorn.The best part of the park was the lunch with the disney crew, but the food really was not good, i had fish and chips at 19Euros and really it was 2 fish fingers, my granddaughter had a mushroom pizza which consisted of a tomato base and raw mushrooms sprinkled on top. all in all i would not recommend anyone to go to Disneyland Paris, far to expensive and far to packed not VFM at all This review is the subjective opinion of a TripAdvisor member and not of",Disneyland_Paris

What we found is that yes on entry the usual excitement was there but as the day progressed we started missing the special Disney moments.The rides are basically the same ones as those we had ridden before perhaps just called something different. There were a couple of different rides but nothing outstanding. All this could have been forgiven but the park is seriously beginning to look old. The bathrooms were horrible, lots of maintenance work is need in them. The food was expensive and frankly not very good. The staff were not nearly as Disneylike looking frankly bored and more interested in their own conversations rather than helping us. We only spent one day here and have to say were delighted that we hadn't booked in for a 3 day trip as would have not been able to fill the days.Disney you have spoiled us before with your fantastic parks and think you need to spend a little more time and money on this one.",Disneyland_Paris

We didn't run into anybody rude, but we did run into lots and lots of lines, even in the middle of February, when it was about 30 degrees out. We There were a couple of rides where we just left, because they weren't moving at all. We have been to Disney in both California and Florida, so we tried to stick to mostly rides and activities we couldn't do at either of those parks. I was disappointed that both the castle and Alice's Labyrinth were closed, as those were things I really wanted to do. Since we didn't repeat many rides we had been on in the US, we were able to do both parks in one long, fast paced day   from opening to closing. If you want a more leisurely time, I would definitely recommend a day per park. We all agree (mom, dad, and 12 year old) that Crush's Coaster (In Disney Studios) was the best ride we went on all day. But, get there first thing. Because, even though the park wasn't supposed to open until 10, the line for the ride was already 45 minutes long at 9:30. I guess they opened early.

137905568,4,2012-8,Netherlands,"Having been to all Disney parks around the world, I feel that I am qualified to review Disneyland Paris. Disneyland Paris, like all other Disney parks is a wonderful place to create magical memories with your friends and family. The extra activities that Disneyland Paris has to offer at the moment due to the 20th anniversary are great. The spectacular finale at 23:00 is worth a visit just on it's own. You will not forget it and you will feel delight for many days after.There aren't many unique rides at Disneyland Paris. All the rides can be found at other Disney parks, which is a shame. I would love it more, if Disney diversified the parks a little more, by offering attractions that can only be found at each individual park. The fastpass system (included in your entrance ticket), is a great way to skip lines, and have a more relaxed experience. The system could be improved though, I experienced long lines at the most popular rides, to even get to the machine, which issue the fastpasses.. kind of defeats the purpose.. Also, the food at Disneyland Paris is awful, simply awful. It isn't that hard to create food of a better quality, which is fast and still appropriate for a theme park. We had the buffet at Caf   Agrabah. It was highly priced (23,99), but at least they had some healthy options. To enter the restaurant we again had to stand in line for 30 minutes (even with a standing reservation).All the toilets restrooms in the park are in need of a permanent attendant, tending to the area. They are always dirty, wet and crowded. If you ever visit Disneyland Tokyo, you will see that it IS possible to have clean restrooms in a themepark. The high entrance fee, should at least pay for clean facilities. The staff at Disneyland Paris is the least friendly out of all the Disney Parks in the world. Disney, the happiest place on earth? Well, I didn't see the patient, happy, smiling castmembers. In the giftshop, in hotel New York, I was treated very rudely by the shop clerk, after which I said to him:  smile, you're at Disney!  His answer was:  I am at Disney, but I am French. French people, are not like that. French people are not smiling and friendly all the time.  Ok.. great answer, huh?The castmembers performing on the parades and the characters throughout the park however, are a delight and they deserve to be complimented. They really make contact with the crowds and you can see that they enjoy the interaction. The Shows and parades are spectacular, magical and unforgettable. Tarzan (the show) is a wonderful way to have a break from walking around, and will leave you in awe. The Early parade is just as magical as the late parade, so make sure to catch both.I was disappointed to see that 'Captain EO'  3D experience has been closed at Disneyland Paris, and I hope that they will choose to open it up again soon.",Disneyland_Paris

But none of that matters when your kid sees Mickey or Stitch and goes crazy. The kids are the only reason to go and their joy makes up for all the queing and poor quality food. Expect to pay at least    10 per head per meal. We got the half board option which actually worked out really well. Make sure you stay at the Disney hotels (they're not great, we stayed in the New York) but most importantly this got us in 2 hours earlier than the masses and it was brilliant, no queues. The parades are great fun and if you let yourself go you'll enjoy it. Spend a few days so you can break the park up.

I am sure it was due to the scorching temperatures but it was a waste of money for the passes. We complained and shall now be writing to Disney for refund on the fast passes.

137712812,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"As ever, everything was fabulous to look at and watch. The rides were great and we all had an amazing time visiting the park for the day. No big queues this time and the weather was perfect. Just wish we had had time to watch the night time show.",Disneyland_Paris
137697555,5,2011-11,United Kingdom,"Cannot fault this park, was amazing, rides were good, very good for small children. Meet and great the characters is delightful for the children to be able too meet their fave characters. Food quality was excellent, get a que jumper though for the rides as they can get very busy!",Disneyland_Paris
137665974,5,2011-12,United Kingdom,We took our three year old daughter to Disneyland Paris in December and she still talks about it now (8 months later!). Its unforgettable for the little ones. Queues on weekends can be quite large but we went Wednesday     Saturday so had plenty of time to get the rides in the week and soak up the extra activities entertainment on the weekend.,Disneyland_Paris
137647023,5,2011-12,Canada,"It's a magic place, the fun isn't only for child, there are too many attractions and fantastic rollercoaster for every age, only one thing, you must choose a good restaurant in the park because the most of the restaurants in disneyland are expensive and not so great...I advice you to sleep in one of the many hotels in disneyland, and not out of the park, yes they are a little bit expensive but your child love him!",Disneyland_Paris
137624280,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"Disneyland Paris is clean and everyone during our trip was so helpful and friendly and assisted to make the experience live up to all our expectations. It is not as large as its American counterparts but this works in its favour. There is so much to see and do, and more is being added all the time. There is something for everyone regardless of age or size. Not only rides but shows, cinema and restaurants. Everything is so well organised from the time you start your journey in the UK. A quick and convenient way to travel is by the Eurostar, which drops you at the start of the Park and Disney Express allows you to go straight into the Park without worrying about your luggage. For kids of all ages and sizes   and aren't we all kids under the skin? Not cheap but well worth every Euro.",Disneyland_Paris
137621956,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"WE as grandparents were not sure if it would be our type of holiday, but we enjoyed every minute there was enough to do whatever age we were and lots of places to eat. The attractions were very busy but we entertained ourseves with the young children so the long waits went past quickly.",Disneyland_Paris
137602249,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We've been to Disneyland Paris many times   love the rides, the kids love the characters, so rather than reviewing the experience, here are our top tips:  if visiting for three days or more, avoid the 3 day pass (164 euros for adults, 144 for kids) especially if you have a car, and buy a Fantasy Annual Passport   slightly more expensive at 169 euros per person (kids too), but you get free car parking (usually 15 euros per day), access to the park from 8am (get to the car park for 7.45am, in at 8 and then onto the big rides, like Peter Pan, Space Mountain and Buzz Lightyear   you can do all three without queuing for more than 10 mins by 8.45am, when it starts to get busier), and 10% off all food and merchandise purchases. We visited six times during our week stay, doing mornings and then returning in the afternoon or evening, avoiding the really busy 11am   3pm times.  ignore the guidance not to take food into Disney   if you have kids, fill your bag with snacks and sandwiches that you can eat in the queues. They check your bag for weapons when you enter, but they aren't bothered if it is packed full of food and drink.  take refillable water bottles and top up at water fountains. Of if you ahve access to a freezer, partially freeze a bottle of water, and keep topping it up   the ice keeps it really cool for a good while, and it is far cheaper than buying drinks in the park.  grab a space for parades early, and be ready to complain when people try and sit in front of you. We waited for two hours for the evening parade on the edge of a kerb, only for folk to try and sit in front of us on the road. Disney staff move them on, but they then try to squeeze around you, especially with little kids. Sad to say, but sharp elbows are a must   late arrivers can be quite ruthless in how they jostle for space (nothing like us Brits who queue even when no one else is doing!)  use Fastpasses wisely, getting them before shows, for example. However, Fastpass machines are generally turned off quite early, so use them as best you can!",Disneyland_Paris
137600141,3,2012-8,Canada,"I would rate this park second, making Disneyland in California first. It was a very nice park. We only took the kids to 2 rides (2 year old and a 5 year old). The food there absolutely sucks! But the staff was friendly ( i was actually expecting rude people as from other reviews i have read). It was very busy. The one thing I would have to complain is Everywhere we were there was a person smoking next to us. Smoking everywhere, lines waiting for the rides, by the washroom, everywhere at restaurants.just crazy smoking. Come on people! Its a kids place. If you have  smoke  concerns just do not go to France at all! Disney and other public places should have a designated area or just ban smoking like the rest of the world!",Disneyland_Paris
137594351,4,2012-8,Canada,"We have been to the Disneyworld in Florida, so we decided to give Disneyland Paris a try. First of all, the park in Paris is smaller and more manageable than the park in Florida, so if you have young children they won   t get tired easily. Secondly, if you have already been to any of the other Disney parks, be warned that this park has the same or very similar rides. Lastly, I recommend that you stay not more than 2 nights as this gives you enough time to do everything and even repeat some rides!We decided to stay at one of the Disney hotels (Kyriat) and we were very pleased with it. The hotel food for breakfast was average but our room was nice and the other areas of the hotel were very clean. If you stay at a Disney hotel there are shuttle busses for guests staying at hotels that aren   t inside the parks but still belonging to the Disneyland resort.The park is pretty clean however the washrooms are a bit dirty and they can be smelly. The staff was friendly and informative. There are long lines so I really recommend fast passes for your family as they really do save you some time! Out of all of the rides, my favourites would have to be: Thunder Mountain, Star Tours, Autopia, Buzz Lightyear: Lazer Blast, Pirates of the Caribbean, It   s a Small World and Alice   s Curious Labyrinth. If you have children that want to meet characters from Disney movies, make sure to bring a notebook, a pen and your camera! You can catch several characters throughout the day and you can wait in a line (sometimes extremely short, sometimes extremely long) and take a picture with them! This will be a memory that they will never forget. Also the Disney parade is worth the wait. Parents will be able to rest while their young ones watch as Disney characters wave to them on beautifully decorated floats. This was one of the highlights during our stay! The fireworks are amazing and I really recommend that you stay late to watch those!One of the negative things that I noticed was that some of the rides were lacking the magic of Disney. I think that if they had some parts replaced and some areas painted it would make a difference. Also sometimes the rides were    out of order    and they weren   t fixed the next day or the day after.Overall the Disneyland Paris is a magical memory for the whole family but I would recommend that you come here especially with young children!",Disneyland_Paris
137578247,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,We loved the park but did take us time to find our way round as we went on a Saturday it was really busy the next day we headed to the other park as it was not as busy. On Monday it was quieter so we went back to disneyland we then had a wonderful time for the rest of our stay.,Disneyland_Paris
137550300,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We visited on the 16th August, the day after public holiday assumption day and the park was surprisingly quiet. Longest queue time was 1 hour. Parade and 20th anniversary show at the end was out of this world. We thought the food was reasonably priced (in the self serve places, not sit down waiter service restaurants).",Disneyland_Paris
137545868,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,Best fun ever for the kids. Try and take your own bottles of water and lunch.  We bought our water at supermarket for 50c but they were 2 euros 70c in the park!,Disneyland_Paris
137544579,1,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We had a very poor experience of Disney. We stayed at the Santa Fe, which was basic, a bit tired looking(could have done with a repaint) but it was clean, rooms cleaned daily, fresh towels and toiletries provided daily. It went downhill from there. We had booked lunch with the characters at Disney Cowboy Cookout BBQ. Food was fairly poor quality, but hadn't really expected much better. We went with the intention of our children getting their autograph books signed. Got a few autographs and pictures, but Tigger (one of my son's (aged 2) favourites)missed out our table three times. When we went over, Tiggers minder said our kids have enough autographs and said we couldn't have Tiggers. My daughter (aged 7) then approached Tigger directly to politely ask him. Tiggers minder told him not to sign it so Tigger then shook his hands and refused, resulting in two very upset children. The next day we planned our day at the studios park, and reserved a table at Le Restaurant Des Stars. We sat down to eat our food and my daughter jumped out of her seat and announced there was a dead mouse under the table. We grabbed the kids, told the staff and demanded our half board meal vouchers back. The staff appeared surprised we wanted to leave the restaurant, but did return our vouchers. It was a  Ratatouille  themed restaurant, but a dead mouse was ridiculous!. (We have yet to try to claim the money back as you have to do that via email with a copy of your vouchers) we went later to report it to Guest Relations, who took a statement , and gave us vouchers for 2 balloons and 2 badges, and 2 passes for immediate boarding for 2 rides. Due to our lunch of crisps and popcorn ( we couldn't stomach anything else after the mouse incident) we were all really hungry so went back to the park for our dinner reservation at 8pm at Agrabah Cafe. We finally got seated at 8.20pm went to the buffet, but there was hardly any food left. When we questioned this, we were told they close at 8.30pm, and everybody was hungry today and they had run out of stock! All this, with a lot of miserable staff, long queues ( which I did expect) for very short rides (which I didn't) made for a Disney experience never to be repeated. We expected much more of the Disney brand,",Disneyland_Paris
137535499,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"This was out 4th trip to Disneyland Paris, having visited Xmas 1994, Summer 1995, Summer 2005.I am not altogether sure why Walt Disney felt France would be a great place to put such a customer service intensive industry, but I can tell you they have definitely NOT got better with practice.The British seem to bring the worst out of Disneyland Paris with 'cast members' being nothing short of rude and arrogant on numerous occasions during our 2 days on the park   not that this is a show stopper for me and my family!The plus side for us   no massive queues, average per ride was 30 45 mins, and seemed to move constantly.What was noticable from our previous visits, lack of regular shows, parades and character appearances   just one or two a day in peak season! This used to be constant, not sure if this is to cut cost or limit the complaints about the staff coming into contact with 'the customer'.No surprises the food is overpriced and poor in choice and quality   even less choice in the studio park. At the very least go prepared with drinks as this quickly see's your budget disappear. We did not see any offer like they have in Florida where you buy a drinks cup and get free refills, so you can easily spend 50 euro for 4 of you in the paris sunshine on soft drinks.We may go back ,as this is definitely something for the kids   but no way would i allow myself to be ripped off with the gate prices.... we had the satisfaction of knowing day 1 had cost just   90 (this is what the french pay while the UK get charged twice as much!!) www.ticket.fr and day 2 was free courtesy of the Sky ticket giveaway!We went to legoland on our return from Disney, and they should definately to do some sharing of best practice as legoland win hands down on customer engagement, food and value for money.",Disneyland_Paris
137516438,2,2012-8,Guernsey,"What a rip off! And the queues   my goodness. 1 hour 40 minutes for a 2 minute ride   just crazy. Distinct lack of characters around this year, very few staff to help and vastly over priced merchandise. Brings out the worst in everyone!",Disneyland_Paris
137516158,3,2012-8,Guernsey,It is what it is but I would never go again. There was a distinct lack of characters around this year. Very few staff around and queues like you would not believe. I fear it brings the worst out of everyone!,Disneyland_Paris
137463625,5,2011-12,United Kingdom,We visited at Christmas and had a great time as soon as we walked into the park their was Mickey ready for a photo shoot. We had some difficulties with Donald as we could not get my 3 year old grandchild near him and the minder said if we came back for the next slot she would make sure Donald would see my grandchild. When he appeared he ran straight over and gave her a big hug and made a lot of fuss making up for the earlier dissapointment. Park was decorated beautifully it was a lovely atmosphere and queues were not that bad. Parades were amazing,Disneyland_Paris
137455868,4,2012-6,Sweden,"So we started out at the Disneyland Park on our 2 day journey, and after wondering around and trying to find the rides we discovered how huge this park really is.

137442584,5,2011-9,United Kingdom,"We went to Disneyland Paris in 2010 and 2011. We didn't stay at any of the Disney hotels so can't comment on that but we took our own caravan to an excellent caravan and camping site 5 mins from Davy Crockett (Quatre des Vents. They hire out chalets too!). What they don't tell you, and only tell the French, is that you can purchase a yearly pass for around the same price as a 3 4 day ticket. You can go in and out as you please, 20% discount in shops and restaurants. And it took us the two years to experience everything (several times on our favourite rides of course)! You need to queue to have your photo taken but it's not too bad. Purchase a day pass then go to the building next to Buzz Lightyear ride for the year pass, day ticket is reimbursed. So if you plan to spend a few days there then it's worth getting a yearly pass and have the 20% discount too. We have had two great holidays using this pass. I found everything to be clean at the parks, excellent parades and fireworks! Only problem I had was queuing in the ladies toilet! The French don't know how to queue and will push in or move to the end cubicles and wait there!!! They can be smelly! Favoruite rides   Thunder Mountain, Indiana Jones, Buzz Lightyear, it's a small world, Aerosmith, Pirates of the Caribbean! Well all of it really. What can I say except can't wait to go again!!!",Disneyland_Paris

137386167,5,2012-8,Denmark,"Great place for kids of all ages. Lots of different attractions, shows and shops. One day isn't enough to try it all. 2 to 3 days is needed, if you want to get the whole Disney experience under your skin.",Disneyland_Paris
137372995,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Having been to Disney World Orlando a couple of times now, we thought we had a good idea of how the park would work. In theory, it's all the same, but there is just not the same level of customer experience that you get in America. Lots of long queues, nothing to keep you distracted and lots of pushing in. The Phantom Mansion broke down 2 days running whilst we were in the queue   we were left there in the queue for an hour before anybody thought to tell the customers what was going on, and then only to escort us out. We did complain and they kindly gave us exit passes for the next day (but only after and hour of complaining). To top it off, I was served a coffee that got tipped over me.The resort was as expected   the room clean but tired, but a nice walk to the parks.The food was really nice   the French really are good with food. Unfortunately it was ruined by the free for all at the buffet service style restaurants. Lots of pushing and rudeness by the locals. I know that us Brits get the mickey taken out of us about queuing, but when you are trying to manage vast numbers of people it is needed.I would suggest going to Disneyland Paris first before going to the US ones.",Disneyland_Paris

137357004,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Very disappointed at the amount of  Technical Difficulties  on various rides eg. Pirates of Caribbean, Peter Pan, Backlot Tour, they let us queue up for over half an hour without telling us these attractions were out of order, someone could have come out and told us, we returned the following day and pirates was still out of order, we asked why it was not fixed after the park was closed, they replied with a shrugging of their arms, not very satisfactory considering we were only there 3 days and we specifically targeted that ride with out grandchildren. We were not even offered a gesture of straight to the front when it was fixed, very very disappointed, it would never have happened in Florida. Also the cinematique theatre, be very aware do not take anyone in under the age of 18years, as there is a scene from the Exorcist on large screen of the BED... We had no warning at all of what was to be viewed, and my 5year old grandchild was traumatised, we complained but no one said anything, (we shall be writing separately to the company) it was appalling to say the least that Disney should have allowed this to be shown.",Disneyland_Paris
137334323,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Wonderful, magical place for kids and adults, we had a really lovely time, the parades are really excellent, the evening one is so pretty with the lights and the fireworks laser show on the castle after the parade is quite amazing and made me quite tearful as it was so lovely. The park staff are really helpful and friendly. My only criticism is that the queues are long and hard in the heat and the food is pricey, but we expected that so weren't surprised. Be prepared to have fun but feel exhausted, hubby and I felt like we needed a holiday to recover from it after !!",Disneyland_Paris
137294099,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We enjoyed our day in Disneyland but having visited the Florida and California parks, we felt that the atmosphere was not as friendly, nor the organisation so efficient. The queues were really long and tiring although we enjoyed all the attractions once we got to the front of the queue. There were even long queues for the toilets and even buying a drink or a snack meant another queue! The children loved their day at Disney though and it made us want to go back to Disneyworld.",Disneyland_Paris

You can only go there once though,the road is tiring, depends on the place where you stay it might take you about 45 minutes away from town.There is lots of food places, where you can sit down and have a snack, there are lockers if you carry valuable, however I don't recommend. It was crowded, try to get there at early hours.",Disneyland_Paris
137287097,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"A one day visit with my 4 year old in August. The park is NOWHERE as good as the American Disney experience, Orlando was wonderful   service, cleanliness, friendliness and the disney magic in bucketfuls. The Paris experience is so different   much longer queues, possibly the most unhappy disney employees ever, less staff too   which meant a dirtier park, dirtier loos and less slick service. We queued for 1 hour in a mexican themed fast food place, an hour!!! We had no choice as we were so hungry by this point. Europeans are much ruder, cannot queue, push and shove and the smoking was out of control   this is not good in a kids theme park. We saw 4 characters but with no system to see them (as in USA) I wasn't going to let my little girl get shoved around in the melee of adults pushing to see a person in a mouse costume!! Two main rides were out of action for part of the time (pirates of the caribean and big thunder mountain)   staff were not explaining what was happening but the shrugging of shoulders was impressive   they wil have RSI! If you want to do the Disney thing   save hard and go to orlando, it is worth it!",Disneyland_Paris
137274397,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Having been to Disneyland in LA and Disneyworld in Florida prior to having children, we expected the same high standard from Disney in Paris. Disneyland Paris is a great way to get a Disney 'fix' especially when your kids are too young to go to Florida and of course going to Florida is a much bigger and pricier destination to go to when travelling from Europe. Another positive is that it's a manageable size, a bit like Alton Towers, so great for young children. There aren't anywhere near as many big rides like you get at Florida. Cafe Mickey in the Disney Village was well worth the money and it was definitely worth booking in advance. The food was good by Disney standards, they didn't rush you, the service was good and you got loads of time with the characters, we thoroughly enjoyed it. Conversely the Rain Forest Cafe was a total rip off. The food came out of the kitchen within minutes and was like tasteless cardboard and came to 60 Euros for 2 adults and 2 small children, pizza, burger, chips, 2 x soft drinks   outrageous.Sadly the toilets weren't up to much in Disneyland Park and the toilets near It's a Small World stank of urine   very poor and a real shock to find them like that at Disney, especially as I'm referring to the ladies loos! In places the park was looking tired and lack lustre. A lick of paint was definitely in order in some places too and I particularly noticed it when queuing for Casey Jnr Train. Maybe we were unlucky but we struggled to meet as many characters as we hoped despite reading 2 guides and making notes where to find them. Princesses were almost impossible to find unless you were either prepared to spend an extortionate amount on lunch with the princesses or queue for between 1 and 2 hours in the Princess Pavilion (which is very warm on a hot day too) only to find that when you get to the end of the queue the very 'unDisneylike' staff won't tell you which princess is in which room (only 2 rooms) and you have to see who they decide to send you in to. We had a very close escape after queueing for an hour and 10 minutes, as we could have ended up with Mulan(who my 2 year old and 4 year old little girls have no idea who she is). Luckily we saw Ariel, I practically leapt on the poor woman in relief that finally my girls were meeting a princess and one they knew and loved!!!! A wholly unnecessary stress. Of course the reason Disneyland Paris are mean with their princess encounters is because in the Pavilion they take a picture or 2 that you ultimately will probably buy. Note to Disney   Princess encounters will make you money   why not have lots more of them?!!!! Everyone's a winner!Disneyland Paris also gets the award for the shortest time you can be on a ride, very frustrating after queuing for a considerable time on some rides.We were just glad that our 2 year old who wasn't quite 3, had free entry to the parks and that my husband and I went free 1 of our 2 days courtesy of a Sky promotion. If it had really been nearly   200 for the 4 of us a day for 2 days, I might have been even more disappointed. We went for 2 days mid week in June outside of school holiday time, weather was mixed but ok on the whole. I felt that we queued enough and that during weekends or school holidays it would have been hideous.All that said most of the shows were excellent, the characters were brilliant when you met them and the parades and Dreams spectacular were magical. Overall, taking our 2 young girls to Disneyland Paris was a genuinely enjoyable experience because they loved it, which really, is what it's all about. They don't see what we see and it's nice for us to see the magic through their eyes. We'll definitely take them to Florida one day and we may even go back to Disneyland Paris again!",Disneyland_Paris
137269961,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We were lucky enough to win two adult tickets to Disneyland so only had to pay for the one child.The park is clean on the whole, however the toilets as described in other reviews are not clean at all and are quite smelly (baby change facility on the other hand was spotless)The queuing was quite simply appalling. We were expecting to have to queue but on average for rides for a child of five we were waiting for a minimum of 45 minutes. We arrived at 10am and queued for an age for tickets, we finally got in to the park about 11 and worked our way from the back of the park at fantasy land. We had little ones in our party and there are plenty of rides which they could go on in Fantasy land. We took a pick nick which is actively discouraged and you can see why, the food inside the park is really expensive with small bottles of fanta costing    3.80 and ice cream is about    3.99. We did stay for the Disney parade (well worth waiting for and for my daughter was the highlight of the day)We felt that more should have been undercover, it was so hot the day we went and no shade was provided. When queuing for that long with little ones more shade would have been good.On the whole we loved our day, but I would have been really disappointed had I paid for our adult tickets because we only managed to go on 5 rides before seven pm.",Disneyland_Paris

137235187,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We have just visited Disneyland Paris with our two grandsons (11 yrs and 7 yrs).This our (Granny and Grandad) 4th Disney experience but the first to Paris. Being August it was very crowded but we made good use of Fast Passes though why some rides as opposed to others are granted this status is a mystery.The running of the Park and the Parades were great hits with the kids though the timing is a little  French . Nothing happens exactly at the promised hour. Our last Disney visit was to Florida nearly 30 years ago but I don't remember as many Parades or appearances of the Characters then which our grandchildren both thoroughly enjoyed. It is an expensive holiday but that is a given. The quality of the food is also debatable though Planet Hollywood was above average (and our Guide book earned us a 20% discount pointed out by the waitress   who earned a cash tip as a result!). The Guide book was Brit Guide by Simon and Susan Veness   full of good advice but hardly  critical .I don't write reviews very often but the reason for doing this one is that the greatest frustration was the frequent breakdown of the rides. Four times we had been queueing for some time and the ride broke down. The chief offenders were Big Thunder Mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean both of which broke down at least 4 times during our 5 day visit. Other problems occurred on Snow White, Pinocchio, Star Tours and Buzz Lightyear (more than once). Over at Disney Studios The Studio Tram Tour had an hour's closure when we were due out on the next tram! Disney Paris is celebrating it's 20th Anniversary but the money spent on that would have been better spent on maintenance in our view. Some of these rides are pretty scary but if you have doubts about their safety........ Nobody was injured during these stoppages but the inconvenience was considerable particularly to those stuck on a mountainside on Big Thunder!We went by the Disney Express Eurostar from Ashford direct to the Park and it was an impeccable service   not much more than 2 hours. We also stayed at the Hotel New York which was close by, had Character visits every morning and while a little tired, which we knew, was very worthwhile. Knock at least one star off everything! We have a new grandchild due in October and in seven or eight years we will look forward to another Disney visit but unless the is considerable expenditure on the existing ride I think we will be going to Florida!

137214104,3,2012-8,United States,"I travelling with husband and two 14 year olds. This was my 3rd or 4th visit and will be the last. The toilets were absolutely filthy. There were queues for the toilets. I was shortchanged getting ice creams and the queues were ridiculously long. We actually did 5 rides in a whole day! Studios are even worse we couldnt even do the Tower of Terror as the queues were always 90 minutes and as you walk round and try to plan the time went and the park closed. Disneyland park advertised it closes at 2300 but you are not allowed past the parade area into Fantasyland as it closes at 2130! I must say I was quite disappointed but for people who haven't been before its fantastic (apart from the toilets that are no good for anyone!). Food was expensive but you expect that. We had quite a nice meal in a bar playing Jazz   cant remember the name, in Frontierland for 59 Euros for 4 of us including a drink, burger chips and a small cake.(Set meals for 13.99 and up but good value compared to some). A lot of people had packed lunches. We took snacks, a drink is 2.95 euros (coke, water etc.) Ice creams 3.99 euros. Out kids did Space Mountain about six times as it was the quickest to get on and easiest to get fast passes to. Recommend the haunted house for all ages and also Pirates of the Caribean both brilliant. Thunder Mountain another favourite. Studios, you must do the backlot tour and Stunt show.

137200091,2,2012-8,United States,"Today was going to be the best day of the 3 week trip in Europe. Why, simple, we are Americans and we are going to Disneyland Paris. Here we believe we will find the same beauty, service, friendliness, and atmosphere we experience in Orlando Florida, after all it is a Disney brand location and that must mean the same Disney corporate structure and ideals that make us feel so welcome in Orlando. Alas, this is not the way it is overseas. We liked where the train station lets you off near the entrance, but the limited number of security guards checking bags, and ticket sales people, made for very long lines and the first hour there spent outside the park. We did get in, and are excited now as we look at the park from a distance, then we see the security guards in the park, intimidating and not happy. The employees overall were not excited to be there, or willing to go out of there way to help you. One thing that very quickly became clear is that this park does not spend enough of its budget cleaning. The table we sat at for lunch was wet from rain, we wiped it off several times before we got a clean towel, same with the seats. I looked around and saw cobwebs, no not planned ones, but real ones from lack of cleaning. The landscaping was not as crisp, trimmed or neat as Orlando either. Many floors have dust and dust bunnies growing on them. It is a shame that this kind of investment was made into the parks, and they spend the same effort cleaning it, as I did my own place when I was a 20 year old bachelor. Meaning not near enough. The crowds are much different as well. People do not yield at all. There are more frowns than smiles, unfortunately. We were glad to go home early, and see smiling happy people in Paris.Next time, it will be Disney in Orlando.",Disneyland_Paris
137193188,3,2012-4,United Kingdom,We went in April 2012 just before the start of the 20 year anniversary. A great place for kids and adults alike.One ride called Big Thunder Mountain we all looked forward to riding was closed for maintenance but the day it was ready to ride it was still faulty.Everything is overpriced but then it is usually a one in a lifetime visit. Long queues but make use of rides that offer FastPass . Great idea that.,Disneyland_Paris
137146960,4,2011-12,United States,"We have visited Disneyland Paris twice now, both at Christmas time. During our second visit it snowed, and I don't mean just a small flurry, this was a full on blizzard. It was freezing and I can recommend that anyone travelling during this time invests in snow suits and boots for their little ones. We hired 2 of the strollers and found these to be invaluable as they ploughed through the snow and kept our children out of the freezing snow. They also served as good transport for taking 2 tired children back to the hotel, which was a 15 minute walk away.The food in the park is not fantastic. All McDonald's style at a premium price and we struggled to find something that our children would eat, however there are eateries outside of the park and the convenience store in the train station sells premade sandwiches.You'll be hard pushed not to get carried away with the Disney Magic and I believe that at least one visit for families is a must.",Disneyland_Paris

Long queues, not all rides had fast pass, even to see Mickey Mouse in his own building (there were 2 or 3 MM so it could have taken even longer). Popular rides broke down a lot . I expected the Disney characters to be walking around all day but they only came out sporadically and then it was a 'football crowd' to try to get a photo or autograph.

The staff were always willing to help and appeared happy to be there. While a lot of people in Paris do not appear happy their staff did.We got the 'fast pass' which gave us the ability to book a time on a number of rides. While it does cost more it saved us around 2 3 hours over the day that we would have had to wait in lines otherwise!The food is not the best onsite but then you are not there for the food. We enjoyed most of the rides.... The kids (7 & 9) thought the pirates one was a bit scary... But then they enjoyed the haunted house so much we did it twice!We had such a good day that we didn't leave until 10.45pm. We left just before closing which is a good idea as we caught the train back into Paris   it leaves at 11pm.Would recommend a visit as the kids (and us big kids) loved the day.,Disneyland_Paris

Restaurants were decent as well. great light and water show in the evenings at the magic palace. Kids were thrilled to see that.

You dont really need 3 days to explore everything here. If you decide to try out every single rides and attractions then you should at least spend 2 days here. The queue to ride on certain attraction is long however it was not too bad when we were here in June 2012. The longest queue that we had to wait was for the train ride which took us about 45 minutes. Others are around 30minutes in average. Although the park is old (opened in 1992), all facilites are in good condition and well taken care off. You can get food & beverage in any part of disney park, so you dont have to worry about it. One thing that i didnt really like is everyone smokes everywhere although there is dedicated areas for smokers.

136888177,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"We visited in August, which of course is busy all I would say is plan your day. At lunch time and when the parades are on visit the busy rides as the ques are huge. I have read other reviews and I can honestly say the staff were very helpful both in the shops and around the park, they all spoke English very well, were only to happy to help and were great with my children, one in particular as my Daughter was trying her best to speak French and the lady helped her and also helped her learn some new words. The park was constantly being cleaned by litter picking and sweeping. We went with my Father in law who is Disabled, we went to City hall when we first got there and got an access card for him, which enabled him to go on the ride through the exit and not have to que, made alot of difference for him as without it he would never have been able to go on the rides. We hired a pushchair every day as the parks are large and the seats get used constantly, it costs 8.95 euros per day and I would say is a life line with any child under the age of 10.The food is expensive and very fast food style, we stayed in a disney hotel so had a huge breakfast and then just ate dinner ( we also brought snacks with us for the kids through out the day). Both the parks are well sign posted, they check you bags before entering the parks by either scanning them or searching them, which in this day an age is just a sad sign of the times.

136846550,5,2012-7,Norway,"Best advice is to hop on to the Disneytrain, but not on the first station at main square where the lines are longer than life, go to for instance Fantasyland and save a lot of time. Look up the times where the most famous Disney characters have meet and greet in public, and be sure that your kid have an autograph book ready and that you have yoyr mob ile og cam at hand. It is not worth 70 80 minutes wait to see Mickey Mouse or a Princesss in their  houses  and pay a lot for Disney photos. Be sure to get to main square well ahead of any parade.

The parents will probably get crazy :D, but the kids will love it.As for me, there are not so many attractions for young people, so if you like rolercoasters, don  t expect much... this is more like living in a disney movie, with the disney characters show and the castle, everything is pink, purple or shiny... you don  t know where to look first, but it has it  s charm :)The food is expensive, also there are long waiting lines for everything, in restaurants, toilets, attractions, you can also get an autogram from a princess or whatever character you like (if you wait for an hour of course..or longer), so you better stay at least for 3 4 days :)",Disneyland_Paris
136729277,2,2012-8,United Kingdom,"My one previous visit to Disneyland was in California and I was quite impressed which means I had positive expectations of this trip with a ten year old. I just cannot understand the hype about it. We stayed in Paris travelling by metro to Marne La Vallee. These are our personal observations.1. Lack of staff   we spent some time in a separate part of the park looking for rides and were eventually told   you have to go to Disneyland  ( which was next door   we were in Studios and did not know it, no proper signs   see below). There was never anyone to ask for directions to coffee places and very importantly toilets and the rides. 2. Signage was amazingly poor   needs to be larger esp for toilets: you have to up on top of it to see it Maps very sketchy and not clear to me.3. Etiquette: as an example queuing an hour for Pirates of the Caribbean and sitting behind a woman who saw nothing but through the lens of her permanently flashing camera. Not Disneyland's   fault  but irksome nevertheless. 4. No giant MIckey Mouse s! Or other characters, as other reviewers have said, as in USA.5. Expense of very poor food: I prefer not to eat meat but not much choice here: one very thin beefburger and one hot dog cost over   15. And you had to queue for half an hour to get it in a cardboard tray.My overall impression was that this must be mass hypnosis. The child I was with said   one or two rides were good but the rest was rubbish . The very young children, the girls in their fairy land dresses, know no different. Good part? I was amused to hear that,   at least she can tell people she has been to Disneyland . Does this emperor have any clothes?.... If you want something a lot less than the (discounted!) fifty pounds each ticket, the very best option is Jardin d'Aclimatisation at Sablons, near La Defense ( best hotel is Frazer Hospitality a brillant new self catering with breakfast hotel) The Jardin has great rides at 3 euros each, free attractions, the occasional dromedary and other animals and snack foods costing less  La Plage   the Seine Beach in August   is free. And don;t let the language barrier put you off. But with small children and without a you may of course go for convenience. ...and maybe it is all about saying we have been to Disneyland? Brilliant marketing. I think it is a cynical rip off living off the very well promoted Disney name. Perhaps Disneyland belongs in America   and it is bigger there ( of course ) . Some people go time and again   but I have to offer our personal experiences   the child loves rides and was predisposed to love Disneyland   but she joined me in hunting for the exit.",Disneyland_Paris
136715192,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,it was soooooo busy   queues for everything and such a bussle trying to do anything   The night time laser show and fireworks at the Castle is fabulous well worth seeing but 11pm is a bit late for the kiddies Disney people,Disneyland_Paris
136708912,2,2012-8,United States,"First off let me say that I am well acquainted with long waits and average expensive food at Disney parks but this park takes it to a whole new level. I am totally surprised that the Disney company has let this park become so shabby and incompetently run compared to their other parks. At first glance it looks like a great place but then you see all the cigarette butts littered in all the planters and on roof tops while waiting in lines at the attractions. Gum is also plastered on the ground in a lot of places yuk! Even though there are designated smoking areas people just smoke where they like even in the lines and the cast members do nothing about it. Several times people jumped the fences to sneak in line even older adults who should know better. The cast members in some of the stores are pretty useless. When we went into the Gibson Girl to get some sundaes there were about 8 9 cast members standing behind the counter with only 3 of them actually working. The others were chatting and leaning against the counter. After waiting about 10 minutes with the line hardly moving we left seriously how do they ever sell anything here. My daughter really wanted to eat at the  Restaurant des Stars  I shouldn't have relented the food was awful and cold a total waste of 53 euros. This was another place with a big line and tons of empty tables don't they want to fill them? it wasn't like there wasn't enough staff to man them all lol. Like others have mentioned the queues were terrible. We are pretty savvy at using fastpasses but even with them it was so difficult because staff members would cut the line off randomly or attractions would break down often. Also, on the Studio Tram Tour they wouldn't fill all the cars they would leave one or two empty and the line was huge. We were going to spend two days here but after one we were done and I doubt we will ever go back. On a positive note the Thunder Mountain Railroad here is the best one we've been on.",Disneyland_Paris

136705240,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Stayed here 2 weeks ago with our 3 year old grandaughter, standard room had 2 double beds, tv 2 English channels (news and Disney channel) Room decor was good, loved the mickey mouse bed throws and their was disney toiletries in the bathroom which was nice. However here is NO tea making facilities in the room so take your own travel kettle and mugs etc. There was an and ironing board and a mini bar which we didnt use. There was also a safe in the room which was free of charge to use. Hotel New york was very close to the disney village and once you walked along the shops you were in Disney Studios then a bit further 2 miutes walk and you were in disney park. BEWARE The rides and attractiona ALL had a 30 to 45 minute wait so our little one only got on 4 rides in a day as it was so hot and tiring to queue up. We had lunch at Mickeys cafe which is virtually on the door step of Hotel New york, we had to book the day b4 as it gets so full and again queues so long. This was one of the highlights of the stay as Mickey, Pluto, Eyore and lots of other characters come to EVERY table and you can take pics with them. The parade in the evening is well worth seeing.The pirates of the Caribbean attraction go's into pitch black darkness as soon as you enter it at lots of parents with under 5s were turning around and comming back out with crying kids(including us) as it was scary for them. Mums also beware that you are not allowed to queue up with your buggy for the rides or attractions buggies have to be left outside of the queues so if you have a little one you have to hold them!! The stunt show in Warner studios is well worth seeing but very noisy and lots of bangs and explosions. Your bag will be searched everytime you leave the hotel to enter the park too.A bottle of coke was 3 Euro and also a ice lolly (magnum type) not much selection was 3 euro. We ate in the Parkside diner in hotel one night, was buffet style, not that great to be honest, not much selection especially for little ones i wouldnt use the restaurant again. There is a Mcdonalds a few mins walk from Hotel New York. We did see a few characters having photos taken and giving autographs to the children but that was only on the 2nd day. Characters do come to the hotel lobby at 8.30 am each morning for photos which was nice, The breakfast was buffet style, can not fault this it was lovely, plenty of choice for everyone. Lots of mums were making ham and cheese rolls for their little ones to take in to the park for snacks which wasa good idea. Staff at hotel were lovely and helpful, i would return here but probably without the kids or when they were much older.",Disneyland_Paris
136698096,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,We visited for one day. We knew it would be busy as it is was The height of summer. Queues were massive. I suggest if you can is pay for the VIP passes this is still not great as not every ride has a fast pass entrance not even every big ride has one. Problems are most Europeans will not queue so expect to be pushed pass don't be afraid to push back. Food is expensive so are drinks. Some staff can also be tipically French and very unhelpful however some willf go well out of there way for you.All in all if you like Disney you will like the park. security is tight with bag checks and X ray there are also French troops outside the park at the train station.,Disneyland_Paris
136692805,4,2011-10,Malaysia,"Our trip with our 2 daughters in October 2011 to Paris had to include a day trip to Euro Disney. Yes, the lines could be long and some of the rides do break down ( Pirates of the Carribean obviously a very popular ride was out of order  probably due to high traffic ) . However the sights and sounds ( although in french ) of my childhood Disney characters did cheer me up even though the weather was cold and chilly , some rides looked a bit tired and the Disney hospitality was found to be wanting in Euro Disney. And the kids were so excited to see their Disney channel characters come to live too.So if you have not been to the Disneylands elsewhere and you are not planning to do so in the near future and you have not set the bar too high ( by reading all the helpful reviews at trip advisor )   you will have a good time.

It is expensive so you just have to expect to pay a lot for snacks meals if you can't take packed lunches.The children did love it and the nighttime parade and show at the close of the park was amazing. Make sure you are positioned in front of the castle for the best spot.

I loved everything   creativeness, design, layout, exlellent state of maintenance, convinience of everything, starting from special shaded routes for queues (the Chateau de Versailles should have one!) and ending with sufficient amount of benches. The variety of meal options, souvenir shops, flowers and trees with fantastic  hair do . I really wanted to stay for life in the haunted house, but we had to leave for the Walt Disney Studio park.

Considering an 8 hour stay is long enough and with an hour out for lunch, one can visit about 6 7 rides at most if one pushes it. I was very disappointed to say the least.The rides were Ok, the crowds limited progress, but the overall feel was really pleasant. We ate in an 'all you can eat' Mediterranean restaurant (G) on the map and that was enjoyable, nice decor, pretty good spread considering and at 26 Euros including deserts (all unlimited) very good value compared to 3 euros for a bottle of water outside!!Obviousely it is August and there will be crowds, but I don't remember waiting more than about 35 mins or so at Orlando parks for the most popular rides. Shame really as we were buzzing about this visit.I won't go back to do he rest of the rides, will only take my daughter to America.",Disneyland_Paris
136526784,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"I don't think the fast pass system works well here. You take a ticket which tells you to come back at a given time when you can walk on the rides. However, by 1pm, Big Thunder Mountain had 9pm for fast track rides which is just silly.There didn't seem to be enough toilets and the ladies were always queuing out of the door.The food and drink prices are exhorbitant for what you get. 50 Euros for cold burgers and fries for 3 people, surely Disney make enough money to charge less on the essentials?The parades were fabulous though, and the illuminations and fireworks are a must see!",Disneyland_Paris

136508184,5,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Take advantage of the Magic hours, regardless of the complaints on here about only a few rides open, it's worth it. Peter Pan, Dumbo and Carousel are all worth the early start plus the breakfast is good but limited Big Thunder and Space mountain are worth the fast pass, but if you time it right during the parades you don't always need them. Star Tours in Discovery land is a hidden gem of a ride. Buzz Lightyear is also fun, but not worth a 70 minute wait (again wait for the parades). Food is expensive but poor in most places but I would recommend Hyperion or Pizza Bella Notte. Avoid the Silver Spur and Plaza gardens which serve overpriced gruel. The Haunted mansion is tame by ride standard these days, but is still fun as is the Peter Pan ride. Make sure you go under the Sleeping beauty castle to meet the dragon!The midnight firework show is spectacular, especially as it runs not long after Fantaluision (the evening parade). The 7o clock parade is actually better if you want to see the Characters and there is an impromptu 11am parade for meet and greet too. The queues aren't managed though so you need to barge your kids in a bit. Don't be polite and wait your turn as certain nationalities have no concept of this and you'll miss your turn. An amazing park and 5 full days still didn't seem enough.",Disneyland_Paris
136499874,3,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Me, my husband and our 2 children age 8 & 6 have just arrived back from Disneyland Paris (4 5 August 2012) we had a 2 day hopped ticket for the 2 parks. We were surprised how quiet the park was and actually walked straight on to several rides, the longest we queue for was 25 30 minutes.My husband and i have been to Disneyland in Florida and LA so this Park was a little disappointing. We hated the fact that so many people smoked all over the park, even in some queues waiting for the rides.Food and drink is VERY VERY expensive, so bring lots of money....Toilets were all horrible and smelled, they all needed a good clean.Only the British bothered queueing, everyone else just pushed in. We were waiting for the parade, which was 8 10 people deep and we witnessed an elderly French lady push a pushchair from the back of the crowd to the very front, knocking children out of her way. She reached our children and tried to move them but i blocked her way and stood infront of her pushchair so she could not get any further.The old lady and her 2 female friends were all shouting at me, and as i had no idea what they were saying i simply smiled at them (which made them shout at me even more) ignored them and enjoyed watching the parade :))))The new  Dreams  show is amazing, with lazers, fireworks and dancing water fountains. But it didn't start until nearly 11pm on both nights we were there, so its a very late night for young children. Followed by a mad rush with 1000's of other people to get out of the park!TIPS:Don't waste your time going on the train around the park, you dont see anything except for trees and the train stations.Bring food and drinks, refill drink bottles at the water fountains dotted around the park",Disneyland_Paris

My feet ached! But my son danced with princes and princesses, he saw fireworks and shows, he ate in Cinderella's Castle and loved the rides and the food. Would love to go back when he's older and able to get on more rides!",Disneyland_Paris

136362814,4,2012-8,United Kingdom,"Loved the park, but was so busy, not just the queues, but just moving about was a struggle due to the sheer volume of people in the park. Also the prices of food and souvenirs was outrageous, although no one forces you to buy these things, and you can take a picnic if you wish.",Disneyland_Paris
136346706,3,2012-7,United States,"My husband and I, while visiting Paris, went to Disneyland Paris. We took the RER A to get there. That was definitely hassle free because the train station is right near the entrance to the park. *Oh, save your RER ticket to swipe it to get out of the train station.After going through security (a bag check basically), we arrived at the ticket entrance. The line to purchase tickets was insane, I am so happy that I purchased the tickets online before we left home. I also got a deal for a park hopper ticket since they are celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the parks opening.Now, I am a huge fan of Disney World and I go at least twice a year, so I am a little partial, so I was expecting the same overly friendly cast members I didn't really get that much. It was a little disappointing since that starts off the enthusiasm of being there. Anyway, we entered the park and there it was, Main Street, with a wonderful view of Sleeping Beauty's castle. We started in Discoveryland. I went on the Space Mountain ride the line was so long, but it was a good ride. We went to Adventureland which was a little suprising. It's an Aladdin theme as opposed to a Jungle theme, so I loved that. To summarize, the negative was that the lines were incredibly long, that park was so crowded (this was a Wednesday, so imagine a Saturday), some of the Cast members weren't as friendly as they could have been and the grounds weren't as  spotless  as the park in Orlando (but now I am being a little too picky). The positive was that they had a few different themes that I had never seen before and they had lots of playgrounds for smaller kids. We also did Disney Studios, but it was also just nice to experience. Unfortunately, two of the rides that I would have like to have ridden were closed for refurbishment. They did have an amazing looking new ride, Crush's Coaster, but by the time we got to it, about 3pm, the line was at least a 75min wait and there was no more FastPass available. My advice is, get there in the morning and get the FastPass first thing because they will run out.All in all, I was happy that I got to visit, but it's not a place that I plan on visiting again.",Disneyland_Paris

Unbeatable for pure escapism and, at this time of year, power walking to see many times you can go on Big Thunder Mountain with no queueing last thing at night! Our favourite hotel is New York   we've stayed there 4 times   it's the closest without the expense of the Disneyland Hotel. btw, we always take our own travel kettle etc for making tea in our room (probably not allowed   but the only option for someone who needs tea first thing in the morning and last thing at night!)I just wanted to advise parents of young aspiring princesses about the cost of the dresses   they are all 59 euros   regardless of size or style. However, I saw some genuine Disney princess dresses in our local Tesco extra for MUCH less than half the Disney cost. I suggest you try to buy before you travel and spend what you save on a meal at one of the restaurants (Silver Spur had the best steak!). Have fun.",Disneyland_Paris
136284735,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"As you walk through the different lands, it is amazing to see the attention to detail. In particular, the Adventure land and Frountieer lands. The buildings and props are fabulous and you really feel like you are in a different country. There are plenty of rides for little children and more vigorous rides for older children and adults. Fast passes are needed for Thunder mountain as this is a very busy ride, probably because it is excellent. Space mountain, Pirates of the caribbean and the Indiana Jones rides often have lulls in the queues so they can be pretty quick (5 minutes!) But in the busy periods you can get Fast passes for Space mountain and Indiana Jones. If you have small children   use the baby switch option too. Still too much smoking in the park (though better than last time we were there)The new firework and light display on the castle after the main parade at night is absolutely amazing. The use of the water curtains to project images is incredible and the music, fire and fireworks make it very spectacular. Quite a magical place for both children and adults.",Disneyland_Paris
136274627,2,2012-7,United Kingdom,"Get your wallets out!! think that is the mantra of these theme parks. we stayed at the disneyland hotel in July with 2 kids. its such a shame that the park was so crowded, you couldn't get near any of the rides without an hour long wait.Everything is so expensive and we were shocked at the low quality and availabilty of good food, young children don't do well waiting for an hour to be stuffed full of chips and greasy burgers which cost 50  euro for a family of 4 everytime you need to get something to eat. Our feeling was that they just let far too many people into the parks at a time. the parades are great but be prepared to be jostled and end up falling back from the side as you can't risk your children being trampled just so they can see the disney characters. The show's and  experiences  they are selling are so expensive its prohibative. We paid   1700 for a 2 night stay at the disneyland hotel thinking it would give us the benefit of early entry to the parks but only a couple of the rides are open before 10am so its not worth it. we have a number of friends and family who have done both the UK and US parks and its worth saving your time and money for a trip to the US rather than France.

Another annoying thing is one adult in q then another 5 turn up & push in, in my book your either in the q or your not! Very expensive for food and shops (but you kind of expect that).

136196240,1,2012-5,New Zealand,"Our family   parents and older kids 21,16, 14 looked forward to this visit with great anticipation as a highlight of our trip. We visited in July and the unbearable queues started just outside the train station. The first queue is a bag check   not sure what they were looking for but they did ask about our food   didn't take it away so I guess it's allowed. We still had to buy some of the nasty, grossly overpriced fast food inside the park. Then there's the ticket queue, and so it went on all day. Most rides had at least a 40 minute wait or longer   the queues are well hidden round corners so that you live in hope that the end is in sight, which it never is. Even the fast track queues were very long. No matter how good the ride, it's hard to justify such a lot of waiting. The sad thing is that most of the rides were pretty lame   maybe ok for very young kids if they could stand the waiting. A couple of good rides lasting 2 3 mins max, the rest were disappointing. The Thunder Mountain ride was broken down, but no signs to tell us that so lots of people were milling about looking for the entrance, finally another visitor told us it was not working and hadn't been the previous day. We queued for 30 minutes at another ride before being told it was broken down   lots of other reviews have commented on these same issues so must be a regular occurrence. We really tried to like the place as we had spent one of our precious days in Paris there, but overall we decided the park was like a very pretty empty shell   all show, no substance. People were wandering around looking for entertainment that simply wasn't there. The nicest, most interesting entrances disappointingly turned out to be fast food joints or yet more shops. Very seriously suggest you don't waste time or money   it cost 300 euro just to get in and was very disappointing. If you simply must go despite being warned   a TIP   we went into an information office to find out where to buy tickets as there were so many queues everywhere and the lady sold them to us there   one queue avoided. Don't go   there are so many better ways to spend time in Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
136165333,3,2012-7,Spain,"The staff here are just not motivated to maintain the high Disney standards. I would say this park is only for the Disney completist. Smokers don't observe the smoking areas or signs   they smoke EVERYWHERE   and staff do little about it. It's dirty, waiting times are incorrectly indicated (we waited 1 hour and 10 minutes for a ride that said it was a 25 minute wait), and fast passes are not available for some of the popular rides. It was not the Disney experience I had hoped for my wife. It will take a long time to convince her that things will be different in the USA.

136114984,2,2012-7,United Kingdom,"If you are staying in France, near disneyland, and you have young children (and a wife who loves Disney) it is impossible to refuse them a trip to the wonderfull world of commercialism. Many of you who read this will no doubt believe that I am some kind of grumpy old man Victor Meldrew type. I am not. I love to have fun and, even more importantly, love to see my kids have fun. This year was my fifth grudging visit to Disneyland Paris. I don't like it, my wife knows I don't like it, so do my kids but I bite the bullet and go anyway. So, I hear you say, what does this grumpy old man dislike so much? Well, here goes   I don't like paying 74 euros per adult per day to get in   I don't like paying 66 euros for my eldest daughter   I don't like paying 15 euros to park my car   I don't like the enormous queues full of anoying French kids who all push in   I don't like the extortionate prices for horrible food (we did take out own food in this year)   I don't like the shops every 10 yards that sell merchandise at ridiculous prices   I don't like trying to entertain my young kids through the boredom of queuing for so long   I could go on but you get the picture. I accept that queues are inevitable but have to say shame on Disney for the rip off pricing on everything.What I will say in the positive is that the parades are good and my kids loved seeing the characters. Would I go here again? If I have my way then no but I will probably be dragged back next year. to those of you holidaying in this area I would suggest yopu consider Parc Asterix as an alternative. Much cheaper, great shows (dolphin show fantastic) good rides and really small queues.",Disneyland_Paris
136049059,4,2012-7,United Kingdom,"Visited for 3 nights 4 days at the end of July. Crowds were as we expected   very busy but we coped. Entrance to the park was straightforward, early magic hours were a great bonus (we stayed at Sequoia Lodge). Hired a stroller for duration of stay and paid a refundable deposit of 70 Euros so that we could take it out of the park to the studios hotel which was well worth it.Some queues for rides were stupidly long   60 minutes plus, but use of Fastpass helped a lot along with going on quieter rides (Pirates of the Caribbean, Small World). We didn't get to go on all the rides we wanted as the queues were too long and the kids just wouldn't stand still for long enough! Queues for photos with characters were very long, but they were lovely with the kids and it was magical to see their faces. We have visited before out of school holidays and it was much better, but once the kids are in school you don't have much choice, so you just have to get on with it!Food and drink very expensive for what you get   it's not awful food, just a shame that there is no real 'French delights' to sample in the park. Take a water bottle and fill up at the fountains, much cheaper than buying drinks throughout the day.Beware of very rude Europeans who simply do not understand the concept of queuing waiting in line or being polite!Overall, a very enjoyable experience, only really worth it though it you manage to get a deal on tickets hotel (booked using 40% discount).

135955965,5,2012-5,Iceland,"Disneyland never fails to excite the children and it makes some of there favorite childhood memories live forever. I went there with my family in may for the 2nd time and stayed at a hotel in the hotel resort area which was very nice. It made a lot of difference waking up almost in the park as we were outside of the park before most of the traffic started. I spent 5 days there and there are clearly a few things that any family should take into consideration. There is a HUGE difference in how many are there on a Monday morning and how many are there on a Saturday morning. Arriving on Sunday evening and leaving on Thursday morning is probably the perfect timing to visit. The number of people increasing just from Wednesday to Thursday is staggering. I spent 2 hrs waiting to get on the Nemo coaster and that was by far the longest waiting time we spent waiting on the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Usually it was from 20 40 minutes. Cutting that time down is easy as the French have excellent baguettes and some fantastic ham and cheese to put on that so take some with you to the park and you can feed the kids while standing in a ques. It  s a great idea to keep the children busy while waiting in the ques. The restaurants in the park are NOT special @ all but they are no supposed to, if you decide to eat there you should go to the Disney village outside of the park and there they have restaurants with nice food.",Disneyland_Paris

There were many, many shops which were massively over priced, they defiantly upped the prices (  100 for a cowboy outfit!).

We bought tickets from our country of residence (offering a better price than on site), but then spent over an hour in line on arrival to exchange the printed vouchers for tickets. Entrance lines (huge crowds) weren't well marked   the original crowds are to get through security (people with bags must be checked   others walk on in)   the only not well marked thing I've found in many visits. Be sure to avail yourself of the fast track option (swipe your tickets at popular rides to come back at a specific time and have a shorter wait   only one available at a time per ticket). Taking your own lunch (especially if it is a multiple meal visit) is advised, as park lunch food is mediocre at best, the restaurants are packed, and it's relatively expensive. For dinner, we advise making reservations in advance (especially if a large family). The Studio side is about making movies, so even things like the car show were a lot of talk an prep to show how things are done (interesting to adults and possibly older kids, but not for small ones).

135596505,2,2012-7,Australia,"Overall, our children had a wonderful time at Disneyland. We enjoyed the rides, when we finally got on them and the parade and the Disney characters were great. Now on to the negativities:1. The complexities of the overall package: vouchers, easypasses, restaurant bookings etc etc etc. All of these things made our overall experience very frustrating and confusing. There were a number of things that happened to us in relation to this but two examples as follows:   we went to the park one morning for breakfast as the breakfast in our hotel was revolting. We were not allowed in to our restaurant of choice because the hotel staff had not given us the correct vouchers to get in so we had to go to the coffee shop to buy a cake and coffee. The cashier at the park advised I could pay with my easy pass then tried to use it and promptly told me I couldn't use it, so I tried to pay with credit card as there was a sign at the cash register that said  Disneyland welcomes MC , was then told CC would not be accepted. We then had to search high and low for a cash machine to change cash and pay with cash. When we checked out of the hotel, we noticed that our bill had been charged so essentially, they charged us twice!    second example of this is in relation to booking restaurants. The written documentation I received before we left home, stated that we should book our restaurants but when I called the booking line, the staff were unable to access the details of my package to advise which restaurants were available to me. We booked restaurants but then we weren't able to access some of them because they were not part of our package....so what's the point of booking them then??? It's all a waste of time and it's very frustrating.The other thing I would say is that the queues are a real problem. The fast pass situation is not a real solution as you can see from the  fast pass  queues. On hot days (when we were there it was over 30 degs cel), there's seating but it's all in the sun so if you want to sit and wait for your family to queue for a ride, there's no where to sit. We often had to sit on the floor.It's often very difficult to see where the entry points are for the rides and there's very limited signage for toilets. The staff do not speak great English so it would really help if these things could stand out more, to save the frustration of trying to find them on a map. I would also say that it would be helpful if we could get more of an idea of what some of the rides that are inside the big warehouses are like. There's very little description of them so the kids are wary to go on.OK, I've complained enough. I know it seems like a whinge but if you don't provide this feedback, I suppose they won't know what needs to be done to improve things. I've visited Disneyworld and other theme parks in Australia, the UK and the US. I'm afraid they do a better job of managing these things than the Europeans, unfortunately.",Disneyland_Paris
135588481,3,2012-7,Germany,"Euro Disney was something everyone should see but it was very hot outside and all of the benches to sit down where in the sun, if you wanted to sit in the shade you had to sit on the ground somewhere and the prices were outragous.

135550727,4,2012-7,United Kingdom,"It's Disney so it's well done. Pretty much based on the Florida blue print although on a smaller scale. In our opinion the Disney Land park is by far the better of the two...the Disney Studios didn't seem very big. Security is good   they xray all your bags etc going in. Toilets are not as fresh as one might hope so be warned   it's France not the USA. The rides are fairly tame as it's for the kids even the Phanton Manor so little kids should be good for a giggle. Food is so expensive your eyes will bleed but what ya gonna do   starve? The quality of the food on site, in our limited experience, was worrying; mainly fast food and not good at that. If you wish to eat in one of the restaurants then best book early at the City Hall on Main street where you can view menus and book a time slot. It's very very very busy. Expect to queue. If you want to ride the train that goes round the site i'd recommend boarding at one of the lesser stations and not the main one at the front of the site as we did   we queued for well over an hour which we didn't (all) really mind but some of the kids around us were resorting to throwing tantrums much to their parents' embarrassement...our friend nearly threw one too as she's a grown up! Do stay for the evening light parade which is as near to real magic as you're likely to ever see   utterly wonderful! It started at about 10.15pm though and people were getting their spots on the pavements from about 8 so take your sandwiches and dig in for a long haul. If you leave it until after 9 you won't be able to see just so well as the pavements are eaily five deep and little kids need to be up on shoulders to get a decent view. If you do get a prime spot on the kerb keep you feet off the road for goodness sake or the staff will tell you to move and you could end up losing your hallowed ground.Maybe worth considering not going in height of summer as it is very hot and there's not a lot of shelter or seats for older folks or moany children. You can hire buggies which take even big kids   we saw a knackered dad in his thirties sitting in one after evicting his toddler so that might be worth considering!Save your pennies if you decide to go; pack real food in a lunch box; drink lots in the heat and use the fast pass facility to save some of the queues....and good luck trying to resist the repetitive strains of  It's a small world  running through your head for the next fortnight!",Disneyland_Paris
135547056,4,2012-7,United Kingdom,"Brilliant organisation, cleanliness, friendliness of staff. I didn't see an unhappy face all the time I was there. Parents felt the magic and were kind and loving to their children, making it a very special time and place. Feel privileged to have been there. Gardens and features hardly get a mention but I was very impressed, do the gardeners work during the hours of darkness?? Our party ranged from a 71yr old, down to 11yr old, and included one with mobility problems. All the staff were very helpful and considerate, just wish I had read up beforehand about the Disability Card, that would have helped even more.",Disneyland_Paris
135541816,3,2012-7,Australia,"I loved everything about Disneyland, the rides, the colourful streets, it transports you back to your childhood. Even the wait in the queues were Ok because the lines move rather quicklyHowever, the food was horrible. Mass produce blahhhh... and expensive. To try and get anything that is healthy or fresh, or FRENCH....good luck! Come prepared to spend a bundle on bad food.",Disneyland_Paris
135523566,1,2012-7,Switzerland,"We experienced ride closures on 5 occasions which totally spoilt our experience. Especially since we had queued for a long time on each occasion. The worst ride was the Indiana Jones which broke down on us twice ! On the first occasion, we were sitting in the car, in the first row, strapped in and ready to go. Then they announced a technical problem with the ride and we had to get off. what a waste of time and a really bad experience for my son.Bearing in mind this is the peak season, what are Disney playing at ??",Disneyland_Paris
135522950,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"We visiting Disneyland Paris in December of 2007 and returned last week. With great weather and the 20th anniversary celebrations the place was simply amazing. Having been to Disney World Florida seven times and also to Disneyland California we can honestly say that this park is as good as any with many of the actual rides and attractions being upgraded versions of the American counterpart. Yes it was very busy but with careful use of the fast pass system you can still do what you need to within the day. Big Thunder Mountain   great ride and cannot be missed.Buzz Lightyear   really good fun for all of the family.Pirates of Caribbean   the best version of this attraction in any Disney parkIt's a Small World   again, this is the best version in any Disney ParkOverall this park is just great, enjoy!",Disneyland_Paris
135518372,5,2012-7,South Africa,What can one say   Disney makes it worth your while! Get the annual pass that gives you discounts on most purchases and access to Fastpass.

135480877,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"Something for everyone, some fabulous shows and sites. The rides were good but expect to queue! Two of the main rides were not open to my family with their 1.40m height limit. More frustrating was the 2hrs we had extra in the park we weren't able to make much use of because not everything in the park is open, especially those rides not considered to be the 'big' ones which leaves parents of the younger children with no advantage!",Disneyland_Paris
135475745,4,2012-7,South Africa,The park is as one would expect from Disney. It is very well done and the rides are awesome. The only complaint is the evening show   Fantalasia (the evening parade) and the Disney Dreams Show. The crowds were unbearable and became just too much. There could be better organisation   maybe even ask everyone to sit or something.What we saw of Disney Dreams was awesome though.,Disneyland_Paris
135472467,4,2012-7,Romania,"We've just returned from our holiday in Paris. For our son 11's birthday we thought it could be a nice present this holiday. Once we found us in front of Disneypark , at 12.00 a.m everything looked like was going to be a really nice day, full of happiness. All decor, all attractions were indeed nice and good fixed, like in all the stories, but terrible busy. We have learned from other reviews about all difficulties, about long waiting in the queues and very short fun at the end, but we've never experienced before. All were rights. No matter how nice looks everything, how much fun you think can have for 1 2 min, at the end of just one day you find yourself exhausted, nerves and very dissapointed bcs you could experience very small number of attraction. For us, as parents was quite frustrating to hear our son  Mom i want also there , but find it quite impossible to do it, physically no human beeing can manage to face such a park more than 5 hours per day. If i would have to plan another travel to Disneyland Paris after we learned , i would say first of all stay inside of Disneyland if you really go only for it. Avoid holidays, no matter weekends or weekdays, the queues for best atraction are 40 60 min. Try one park in a day, 2 parks is impossible. Never expect to check more than 6 8 attraction in one day. In the morning it can be just a little better in Disneypark for the waiting time, after Disney Studio close 17.00 it is getting more busy and longer to stay in queues.",Disneyland_Paris
135471008,1,2012-7,Australia,"We had organized the visit quite well. Parking was easy. Getting to the Park was very easy as well. The rest of the day was unfortunately disappointing. There were thousands of people everywhere. Waiting times for rides and things to do was in excess of 45 minutes. With young kids that is a long time to wait around for 2 minutes of fun.Walking around the park was very trying to say the least. We went to both parks and the Movie Park was pointless. Still more people and I waited 20 minutes to purchase two drinks at a vendor. Sorry to say, I just do not get it. There were no Disney character's to see or meet, limited spots for lunch, ques everywhere and really nothing to see.My three boys agree with me. It was a waste of money. I understand that we went at peak season but really the visit was our low point in our 2 month Europe visit.",Disneyland_Paris
135458168,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"Had a great 4 days not even the rain could spoil it. Travelled from St Pancras, London. Straight into the park on arrival. Luggage taken straight to hotel. Busy as you would expect but we feel worth another visit. Thinking about a winter trip next. Food expensive but good, we had a half board package which saved us a lot of money. Staff helpful, park very clean. Toilets a trifle smelly. Queue's for ride's but that was expected. MGM Studio's a little disappointing. Half a day was enough for us. Disney Village also gets the thumbs up. Plenty of places to eat and choices too. lots to see and do. Shopping great. Even a christmas disney shop.",Disneyland_Paris

135440804,5,2011-10,Netherlands,We went to Disneyland on a day where there where not much visitors. Wen could do a lot of rides and visit shows. Also the whole park is Disney.

135436343,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"I loved eurodisney and the Eurostar is much better than taking a plane. There was a lot of walking but it was worth it. I wouldn't recommend it for couples, maybe people who have kids and are about 7 and over because it will be easier for them to go on the rides.I stayed at Newport bay hotel, and it was amazing, the food was very tasty and clean and the rooms were lovely so I wouldn't complain about them.the rides were amazing and how they've done it is very good and fun!! If visiting Disneyland newport bay I would reccomend you to see stunts spectacular show which is so different to what you would expect in other countries.I hope you visit eurodisney and have a great time if so.",Disneyland_Paris
135433855,4,2012-7,United Kingdom,"Firstly let me say that Walt would not be disappointed! Many of the attractions are identical to WDW and the overall appearance and feel of the place was the same. The castle is beautiful and the grounds well presented.The parks are a little small, but that does mean that the attractions are close together. This means less walking, but also leaves less room for theming. This made it all feel a little rushed. There was also a slight lack of entertainment whilst queing. Any pre show type videos were only shown for the last 10 mins or so of queuing. For example, after 50 mins or more queuing for the parachute drop from toy story, this felt like an after thought.There was no backstory at all present for many rides such as Space mountain and Crushes coaster. This all made it feel less polished and slick. It was also difficult to keep small children entertained for over an hour.As a huge Indy fan, I was really disappointed with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril. No theming or backstory made this like a ride on any other fairground. More could certainly be made of this.On the plus side, the park looked great. Prices in the park were as expected. Food was reasonably priced and good quality. The parades were Disney standard and loved by all who watched. (Parade time is one of the best to get some rides done!) The nightime spectacular was well worth the wait as the castle came to life with many characters being projected onto it. The fireworks were accompanied with ooohs and aaahs and were a great way to finish the day. After 13 1 2 hours I was raring to go back!",Disneyland_Paris
135431400,3,2012-7,United Kingdom,"We just returned from a 2 day stay at Disneyland Paris, and I have to say, it doesn't compare well to Disneyland in Orlando. We were very aware that it would be smaller than the Florida park, but even though we were visiting during what I thought would be the height of the season (July 23 24), many, many rides and attractions were closed, there were very few staff (or  cast members  around), we didn't see a single Disney character in the park, and, when we tried to get a meal on the 24th in the main park, our only options were quick food on  Main St . Of the several restaurants listed in the Disney brochure (not counting the counter service hotdogs and chicken nugget places), only three were open, and none of those could accommodate the three of us (as all the park visitors were forced to eat at one of the few open restaurants). It really felt like the place had fallen on hard times, and we were very disappointed during our visit. Not sure I would recommend it except for a day out with very young children.",Disneyland_Paris
135418227,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"The queues to get in the disabled area lasted for ages as only one person dealing with this side, so could have done with more booths as you have to show all entitlements etc to get in, but once in they gave us all wrist bands so none of the family had to queue to get on any rides so we saved a lot of time.The park was extremely clean and so magical, Disney makes a child out of everyone and its hard not to be taken in by the magic of the park.Drink and food was far to expensive and although we took drinks in as it was so humid we soon demolished those. The rides were varied and had all the levels of rides covered, and even I went on some and i hate rides of any description. All the family went on the finding nemo ride and thought it would be a child's ride and were so surprised to be thrown about, this was probably the worse white knuckle of them all :) The parade was fun and well worth watching. You really need more than one day there to take everything in, and not to be rushing around. Found many of the French to be pushy and rude and one even hit my mum in the face with a bag of shopping trying to barge past her wheel chair to get one in front in a queue.",Disneyland_Paris
135404611,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,Always fun in the Park.  The queues were not as long as we thought.  Longest queue took 30 minutes.  They have got very tight on security.  (Bit scary seeing soldiers with guns in the Eurostar station.),Disneyland_Paris
135397106,4,2012-6,Lebanon,"We liked disney land park, but what was very weird , is the cleanliness level, you dont see any cleaning employees in the park, specially near the food outlets, park employees were very friendly, many rides we had to skip as the waiting time was too long approx. 1 hrs and the FASTpass works only for thrilling rides which are not suitable for our kids aged 8 and 5. I really wished there was something that entitles you to pay more and not to wait, as we were there for short period of 3days and wished we can play in all rides.The disney magic is very nice.",Disneyland_Paris
135396961,4,2012-7,United Kingdom,"This is the second time we have been to Disneyland Paris and the magic was still there, but some of the facilities have seen better days. I would recommend going to the Disney village outside of the park as it seems less busy, then spend the day in the park just on rides and watching parades. So much to do and see and so little time to do it in.",Disneyland_Paris
135395204,5,2012-6,United States,"Yep, it's expensive (but surprisingly cheaper than Anaheim) but we had a great time. The weather was a little rainy and there was not a big crowd which made it nice. We enjoyed the rides, some a little different than we have in California. Loved the dragon under the castle. Loved the hall with the Statue of Liberty tributes. Food is pretty good, not cheap. Go eat at the Videopolis. Lots of the restaurants close early so make sure you know where you are going to eat and when. Get reservations. No churros   get a crepe. We liked the Cinemagique over at the Walt Disney Studios park too. It was great.",Disneyland_Paris
135366594,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,An amazing place to visit with little kids. My daughter is three and she was so star stuck by seeing her fav characters.If you have a princess mad girly like we do i would recomend getting to the Princess Pavillion as soon as the park opens to avoid the 90 minute wait! Also if you hang outside the paviollion on the hour and half hour you will see the princesses going in and then coming out. My daughter was super pleased with this as she not only met Cinderella but also saw five other princesses. Plan where you want to view the parade from and get there early so you have a good view (don't miss the parade they totally make the visit!).,Disneyland_Paris
135365882,4,2012-7,United Kingdom,"Loved it, it's just the same as Florida and California  Hated some of the many pushy people here,   Loved the parades but would have liked them earlier so younger children could have stayed awake for the fireworks too.",Disneyland_Paris
135354335,2,2012-7,Canada,"I came here with my girlfriend, she has been here before and loves it. I am not hating on this place, it is a cool place but for a couple or someone without kids I think it only has so much appeal. All the kids there seemed to love it, they all had huge smiles and it was awesome to see so many children having a great time. I just don't think there is much there for a purely adult demographic which sucks because adults pay the entry fees. Saying that, it is Disney Land and the place is pretty spectacular. The grounds are clean, well manicured and looked after, there are plenty of staff there to assist guests. The entrance fees are very expensive, 74 euros per adult for a 2 park pass for one day is pretty ridiculous in my opinion. I have been to many, many theme parks on 4 continents and this was the most expensive by far. The food and drink is also more than you would pay outside the park but it isn't ridiculously expensive to their credit. For most of the attractions you are looking at  30 minutes, saying that the lines did seem to move faster the majority of the time compared to the predicted wait. There are little electronic clocks at the front of the attractions that alert you on how long to expect. This is a good idea and allows you to time manage better. Most of the shows are similar to other parks like Universal Studios, Dreamworld and Warner Brothers movie world to name a few but they are still entertaining. The movie magic illusion show was amazing, probably the thing I enjoyed most in both parks. The movie studio park closes officially at 7 yet at 5:30 we couldn't buy food or drink from several of the vendors there. Be warned also that most the shows, rides and parades etc finish earlier at both parks well before closing ie at least an hour, be sure to check the program. I didn't get to go on a few of the rides but the simulator, pirates of the Caribbean and a few others that I thought would be exhilarating failed to hit the spot. I think the rides cater more to the kids which I understand but there are many rides coded blue which means family friendly for kids and only a few coded orange for exhilarating rides. The ones coded orange took it to a comfortable level but just when you are getting the adrenalin pumping seems to be where they peak. If you are a thrill seeker or there with some friends and want to experience some rides that are going to knock your socks off, I would recommend you look elsewhere.",Disneyland_Paris
135318469,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"I   m a massive Disney fan and with Paris being our closest Disneyland I try to go as often as possible. It Never disappoints, this was my second visit this year and the Disney Dreams show is out of this world, one of the best things I have ever seen. The Tarzan show is not to be missed; it is a typical Disney show with a Cirque du Solei element to it. On this visit I decided to give the guided park tour a go, Brilliant, although I will add it   s not for everyone. Its a two hour walking tour of the park(available in all languages) and talks through hidden secrets of the park, many tips to be had and details on the many genuine antiques present in the park. Also many facts on the buildings and history of the park. For me Disney never fails to bring magic to my holiday. I really recommend a character dining experience as they are not much more expensive than the other table service restaurants and are a lovely way to guarantee meeting the characters. Also dont rush off after disneydreams, if you hang around in the park you will get to spend an hour in a desserted lit up main street and miss the crowds at the car parks and bus station",Disneyland_Paris
135280759,4,2012-7,United Kingdom,"Lovely, happy atmosphere with lots of rides for all ages and the characters were really good. We imagined they would be wandering around the park to enable meeting them but some of them were based inside and you had to queue; mickey mouse was in an inside venue as were the princesses, the princesses were a minimum 60 min wait   impossible with young children! the characters we did meet were so good with my toddler and she responded really well to them   very impressed! When you are finished with the rides there are so many disney shops to purchase in and the prices did not differ either. Also food wise   alot of it was fast food but there were lots of choice and easy to access and plenty of seating and not more than 10 13 euro for a main, dessert and drink, bottled water is very expensive though.The parades are very good but be prepared to get there early and be shoved about as they get very busy (one was at 7pm and another at 10.15pm) very well done though. As this is the 20th year they also had a disney train which ran about 5 times a day, hourly. We managed to catch it twice and met pluto the second time, kids love it as it is bright and fun. Beautiful park with lots of facilities and rides aswell as activities happening. I would highly recommend pre purchasing your tickets at this time of year as the queues are immense.Don't be put off by your childrens ages as my 21 2 year old loved it and there were plenty of older kids there and lots of adults   everyone loves disney!! : )I cannot wait to go back again!!",Disneyland_Paris
135239004,4,2012-7,South Africa,"One day ticket to both parks cost us 274 Euros for a family of 5. And another 40 something Euros for the return train ticket from Paris. Bit expensive for a one day outing, but as a once off I think it was worth it. The biggest challenge is finding time to do all the things you want to do, considering you can easily waste half the day waiting in queues. We visited just before the French school holidays, arrived at 10 am when the parks opened and very quickly most of the top rides had queues of one hour or longer. Fortunately many of the queue areas are undercover, so at least there is some protection from sun or rain. The fast pass was a bit pointless because at 11 am we got a fast pass for a ride in the Studios and only managed to get a 5pm time slot, and you can only get one fast pass at a time. By then we were in the main park and had to walk back to the Studios to use the fast pass. After that ride, we got another fast pass and were given a 10 pm time slot. On two occasions a ride stopped working for technical reasons and was temporarily closed, after having already queued for half an hour.Having said all that, the rides were fun and the kids had a blast, it was one of the highlights of their trip to Europe. The parade was great fun especially for younger kids, and the final show with fireworks at the castle was also well worth waiting for.The biggest challenge was getting home afterwards. After the show ended at 11h30 pm we took the kids to the toilet and finally reached the train platform after midnight. Managed to get on a train but I was aware that the metro only runs until 1 am so we decided to get off at the first station where we could change to our metro line (there was an option to change at a later station, as our metro line intersects the train line twice). We got off the train at 00h45 am and got to the metro platform only to hear that the last train had left at 00h40 am and there were no more metro trains. So off we went with three very tired little children to try and find a taxi or a night bus (along with dozens of other people from Disney, I'm sure this happens every night!). The taxis were snapped up by other people as they arrived, and when we eventually got to a taxi first we were told they cannot take 5 people, even though the youngest was 4 years old and could easily sit on my lap. We asked three different taxi drivers and all of them refused to take us. Long story but eventually we got on a night bus, only to have someone faint on the bus and the bus driver refused to carry on and chased everyone off. We walked the last 5 km to our hotel and eventually got to bed at 3 am. Fine for me but a major challenge for my 4 year old and 9 year old girls who had been on their feet all day already. So my advice is, get to your final metro line before 00h30 if you need to get home with the metro!Would I go to Disney again? Probably not. But if you ask my kids the same question they will definitely want to go again.",Disneyland_Paris

We paid at one points   5 for a bottle of diet coke!!

135108622,3,2012-7,United States,"I am a regular at the original Disneyland in Anaheim, so I know what Disney can do if it wants. Although I don't expect parks outside of the US to be the same, some of the Disney charm was missing for me.For starters, some of the DLP cast members are great, but there are a lot of so so cast members. I realize they have a tough job in that they deal with tourists of many nationalities who speak different languages & have different customs, but I missed some of the smiles that the cast members work hard to put on here in CA. The original Disneyland is super at making the kids feel really special (i.e. a  hello princess  to little girls).Secondly, the visitors to DLP have a higher percentage of rude people compared to what you will find in CA, although I will say the line cutting was not as bad as at Hong Kong Disneyland (where it was terrible, but I also went in 2005, the year it opened, so hopefully Disney has re worked some of the queues to discourage the line problems). Thirdly, and perhaps the worst for me personally, is that the only places where there are no smokers are in the designated smoking areas. While DLP officially proclaims to be no smoking except for designated areas, no one does anything to enforce the policy. It is excused as the French will be French, except the French do NOT smoke on the metro, in malls, or other areas where the no smoking ban is apparently enforced. It's a matter of asking smokers to use the smoking area. I realize it's a pain to enforce, but eventually visitors will get the idea if you keep at it.I realize that for smokers it is a pain to have to go to a smoking area, but I have vasomotor rhinitis and was severely affected by all the smoking to such an extent that I had frequent coughing & sneezing fits and was hoarse for two days after. On a busy day, there is no escape from the smoke, and in the queue's you are pretty much stuck with someone's smoke in your face. I also don't like exposing my child to that much second hand smoke.Another problem at the park, and one that might be difficult to solve, is the smell of the women's restrooms. Many countries don't typically flush toilet paper and put it in the trash instead. What that means for the women's bathroom is a super strong stench of urine mixed with a bit of poo smell. Nice...NOT! Either the bathrooms need to have the trash in each stall dumped super often or a small sign with many languages needs to be posted informing visitors that it's ok to flush small amounts of toilet paper.Others have commented more extensively on the rides, but I will add just a couple of remarks. My daughter's favorite was Big Thunder, which is also one of her favorites at the original Disney. I liked the seating at Big Thunder better in Paris; the Anaheim ones have odd legroom in rows 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13, making those seats less comfortable for average to tall people compared to other rows, but the Paris Big Thunder train cars were fine no matter which row you are in. We expected to love Space Mountain, but when people say it's jerky, I didn't realize that it is hurt your neck jerky; even if you hold your head back, your neck will get jerked from side to side and hit the bars that secure you in. The ride would be awesome if there were some cushioning along the bars where your head sits.",Disneyland_Paris

We enjoyed thunder mountain and the bridges and tree house and also the car rally driving. There are not a lot of restuarants open at lunch time in the park and almost no options for lunch with the half board option which was surprising as I'm sure the restuarants would be full at lunch if they were open.",Disneyland_Paris
135084129,2,2012-7,United Kingdom,"If you want to really give your kids a Disneyland experience take them to Orlando or LA. the French version is just expensive, overcrowded and with horrible service. First you pay the parking, then you queue for tickets (really no point in buying online as you will queue anyway and there is no discount). Then if you want to see any of te hotter attractions you queues for an hour or so. If you want to a old this you can buy for 60 euros in the city hall a fast track express card and the top 5 attractions you can access without waiting. However being in France where money and service are frowned upon you only partially jump the queues. Overall service is slow. Staff always addresses you in French first and not very friendly overall.

We had researched that before going but decided that was a meal not to be missed hence why !only one adult accompaned the child.A small box of popcorn was nearly   5 't get I won't go on but after paying for the entry tickets dont get ripped off for food and drink   a small bottle of water was   3.50.",Disneyland_Paris
135053391,5,2012-7,Netherlands,"I love everything about Disney, so nothing dislike on this. The Dreamspectacle late at night is so very specteculair, you must see! Tip: take a Dream meal in one of the restaurants (Walts, Bleu lagoon or Silver Spur, Eur 40,00 pp) and you get a special VIP area place to view the show!!",Disneyland_Paris
135031989,4,2011-10,Singapore,"I really love visiting DisneyLand because it's always a great escape from reality. It was really easy to get there via the RER A. I didn't think the parks were as good as those in LA, Orlando or Tokyo, but overall still enjoyable. I really liked the Toy Story Land and the Studio Tram Tour in Walt Disney Studios Park. The two parks one day ticket was enough to see almost everything in both parks because they aren't that big at all. The only disappointment I had was how most restaurants were closed about 30min to an hr before the park's closing so my ravenous friend and I had to rush all over the park trying to find something to eat. And yes, we knew that we could get food outside the parks but we just wanted to eat there and then. If you run out of time at the park and want to buy some souvenirs, just head to the large Disney retail store at the Disney Village.",Disneyland_Paris
134996903,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,The Autopia ride was good and the Buzz Lighyear ride was good as the children were able to be interactive.,Disneyland_Paris
134989066,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,You know what you expect but we were very pleased and on occasion thought we were in the USA. By far the best service we have had on our trip so far. Very easy to reach by train from Paris and easy to buy food and snacks at the station to take into the park or even if one pops out quickly. Food in the park is very expensive.The Studio Park next door is OK but certainly does not need more than half a day or so.,Disneyland_Paris
134928536,4,2012-7,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from our second trip to Disneyland Paris. We were there for 4 nights 5 days & felt this was ample time as towards the end your feet feel pretty dead but it gave you more than enough time to see nearly all the attractions and rides. Lots of people on here complain that it isn't the standard of America however also having experience in the USA park I think it's unfair to try and compare the two, being different atmospheres in different parts of the world.We can certainly agree with people that there are a lot of angry rude visitors who don't understand what a queue is, however this didn't really spoil our time there, was just frustrating!The park itself is magical as always and we were constantly seeing workmen repainting and improving parts of the park. As with other reviews, the toilets weren't exactly the cleanest of places but then again it isn't the park that puts them in that state in the first place!The Disney park itself is very very clean, whatever litter there is, is cleaned up straight away and is well maintained. The weather when we went was very hot so we found buying a water bottle from the shop in the train station (1 euro) is not only half the price but can be filled up at one of the many water fountains which was fantastic. Food was good, expensive but then again you're at disneyland so you can't expect it to be cheap! We ate at Hakuna Matata, the Lucky Nugget, Fuento del Oro and Caseys so there was a wide range of different types of food, something for everyone. For two people it was roughly 22 euros for a set meal with pudding and drinks. We also tried Fantasia Gelati which was amazing and had the best ice cream in the park! (Try the banana chocolate flavour!)Rides were all working apart from one ride on Star Tours which was quickly fixed and we were offered another ride with no queueing. Get in at 8am if you're in a hotel as this was the only time we could ride Buzz Lightyear or Peter Pan without there being large 55 min queues. Space Mountain was also quiet in the mornings so make the most of this time!We didn't use fastpass as much as the first time due to huge queues however by going at quiet times eg parades, early openings, you can get on things much quicker!Dreams firework show was the highlight of our stay and we highly recommend you don't miss it! We watched it everyday it was so fantastic and you can get a good view in most parts surrounding main street however there are many children on shoulders which gets a bit annoying but not hard to work around with a camera!Get to the edge of the pavements for a good view of the parades around half an hour 45 mins before they start as when it gets to 15 mins before you struggle to get a good spot!Watch out for people trying to push in front as many adults send their children infront of you then squash in pushing you out when you queued for twice the time they have!Overall though parades were fantastic and the floats were so creative and magical and much different to what we had previously seen!Disney studios is the second park and much smaller and busier but still worth a visit! We managed to get on Crush's Coaster as soon as the park opened and even then queued for a good half an hour (Usually queues can get to 120 mins at lunch time so make this ride a priority!). Toy Story land was a great new addition to the park with quite a few rides for small children and great scenery. Tower of Terror and Aerosmith brilliant as always and the tram ride and car show were also worth a visit!!Head to the Backlot restaurant for quiet queues, good food and great themes in a pirates of the caribbean and high school musical inspired area. (Prices same as disney park).Merch is brilliant, your usual mugs, tshirts, hats   a lot of shops seem to stock the same items however if you look closely there are a few items that are really worthwhile and collectable. The exclusive 20th anniversary collections are really special. Prices range from 2 euros to 200 but overall we found everything pretty reasonable spending at most 25 euros on a big mickey mouse.TIPS:  Plan your day with your map as we found out the hard way there is a LOT of walking which tires you out by dinnertime!  Buy a water bottle at the train station shop and refill at fountains usually by toilets.  Try an ice cream at Fantasia Gelati (triple scoop 3.75) as this is the only place we found that does real ice cream not in a packet! This is also a great place to meet characters as they come out the door next to the shop!  Get to the parades half an hour early to bag a good spot.  Eat dinner in the Village, less busy and no reservations usually.  TAKE PARACETAMOL! If you are prone to headaches and only take a packet you are stuck! Nowhere sells them and we were told the nearest chemist was a train ride to paris! These are also great to take for sore muscles at the end of the day along with a bit of deep heat!Overall this was an amazing 2nd trip to disneyland paris and despite being 20 & 25 we found it to be just as magical as a 5 year old! Sure the park is expensive but you are paying for a treat and just try to enjoy it and not get worked up by rude visitors or queues, there really is something for everyone!",Disneyland_Paris
134927956,5,2012-7,United States,Loved the early pass 8 until 10am... great for the young and old,Disneyland_Paris
134925242,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,We had a great day as you would expect however they advertise rides for 3 years up   this is not the case.  I would nt go again until my kids are at least 5 years old....,Disneyland_Paris
134912773,3,2012-7,United Kingdom,"We visited the Disneyland Paris Resort as a birthday surprise, staying two nights with access to both parks for three days.The entrance to the parks is located towards the end of the Village and it is quick to dash in and out of each if your tickets allow it. We were optimistic about the queue lengths throughout our stay due to the inclement weather. However we only managed to squeeze in two rides in the 3hrs before the Disney Dreams night time show. The queue times easily reached between 60 90mins and Fast passes were gone just as quickly. On the other hand we just about managed to ride everything we wanted over the three day period.Once in a queue you were subjected to pushing, shoving, smoking and line jumping. I've never experienced anything like it in all the worldwide theme parks I've been to. On top of that, there is not a lot to keep your attention which just exacerbates the situation.After the long queues you can be equally disappointed with the tired staff and ultimately the quality of the attractions. The park is by far the best looking Magic Kingdom going, but ti doesn't have the maintenance to match. Rides were intermittently open or even stopping during our ride....not to mention the general state of some of the themeing. This was an overall impression of the park too.There are some stand out rides though, Big Thunder Mountain being one (if its open) along with Pirates of the Caribbean. I would recommend more but they fall behind the newly updated versions around the world, such as Phantom Manor. The Parades were very good, especially Fantillusion just before the night time show, Disney Dreams. It is by far the best night time show I've seen at any of the Disney Parks...it really will enchant you and take your breath away.We had a great meal in the Blue Lagoon and also at the Plaza Gardens buffet. We had Meal vouchers  and they made it easy to eat in the parks, not to mention a bit of a saving.Having both visited once before over 15yrs ago, we were really excited but ultimately left disheartened. We had a good time but it was marred by the bored staff, mixed customer service, disproportionate queue lengths and the tragic state of the park. We won't be returning again anytime soon, but hopefully when its time to take our own children it will have undergone some serious and much needed change. Until then we'll save our pennies and go back to Florida.",Disneyland_Paris
134902407,4,2012-7,Denmark,This was my 8th. visit to the park. It is stil worth visiting; but the prewailing crisis has had its mark on the amusement park. Some attractions have disappeared and others look somewhat used.One problem is that the capacity seems inadequate compared with the number of visitors   and we were ther before the peak of the season!In spite of this   we will return for the 25 yer aniversery in 2017 if we live ling enough.,Disneyland_Paris
134888041,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"My family visited this resort, and found the whole holidaya thrilling experience.The hotel was wonderful, we have stayed in boththe Disney and the Newport, and they are excellent.The whole of Disney is so professionally run,and if you go at the right time(Not school holidays)the wait for rides is not too bad.The downside of Disney is that they offerfree nights and free child etc.but when they've got you thereit is just too expensive to eat.It costs a fortune just for about everything.Families who thought they had a good deal,were getting caught out by the astronomical prices.",Disneyland_Paris
134876491,4,2012-6,United States,"To get the best out of a day in Disneyland Paris you must plan carefully. Chances are it will be busy and queues will be long. Work out in advance which rides or attractions interest you and build in breaks to suit your family group.If you are staying in a Disney hotel you get the chance to get in the park early and this will be the time to go on some of the popular rides before the crowds build up. Our niggles: The security bag check ! Caused long delays at peak times and wasn't that thorough anyway. Too many rides not operational Meeting the characters was chaos   rarely controlled resulting in pushing to get to the front and poor opportunities for photos.Misinformation about the 'photos on the rides' package   We asked several members of staff but got several different (and incorrect!) explanations.But, we loved: The evening light show The paradeAll the rides we went on  our grandson loved the Buzz Lightyear laser blaster   we must have gone on 6 times over the holiday. Photo tip  if you are interested in the ride character photos ask for a photo card at the first ride which takes your photo. It is free and staff will load your photos on as they are taken during your stay. At the end of your holiday you can pick your favourites and buy a batch at a discount price . I think it is 4 for 25 euros but can't remember exactly.",Disneyland_Paris

134840069,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We were a little concerned after reading several poor reviews of Disneyland Paris. However, we were most impressed during our visit. The staff were all very polite and friendly. It seemed to us that people who were friendley and polite to staff got friendly and polite service in return. We took food and drink into the parks and this was allowed by staff. In fact on DLRP website park rules it actually says that it is fine to take food and drink into the park. Water is cheaper to buy at the supermarket at the train station which we took in with us. The queues can be long but use of the Fastpass system saved plenty of time. If you want a decent burger and chip meal with dessert and drink for 18 euros, head to the Disney Village and Annette's Diner   Good food and service. For a meal with the characters go to Inventions restaurant in the Disney Hotel   it is expensive but worth it if you have kids who want the characters fussing over them all night. Price is appox 48 Euros per adult. To save money, stay at the Magic Circus, Dream Castle or Explorers Hotel outside the park with excellent free shuttle bus. Book park tickets in the uk using a ticket agent like Attraction Tickets Direct. We found 3 days was just about right but are now planning to go back soon.",Disneyland_Paris

134819514,4,2012-7,United Kingdom,"We have enjoyed visits to Disneyland Paris several times before and returned agin this year after a 5 year absence. The attractions are of the same high quality and we all enjoyed the various rides and shows. However, the quality of the service in the park, the food, the cleanliness of the toilets and the poor behaviour of the other guests have resulted in me removing 1 mark. The wait time in shops to be served is unacceptable, staff appear uninterested and move very slowly. We have eaten in Disneyland in the past and the food was OK, this time the experience was awful. You stand in line for what seems like an eternity to place your order, trying not to faint at the prices (55euro for a burger, 3 chicken nuggets, 4 fries and 4 drinks!!!) then wait and wait and wait for your food to be thrown on a tray by people who have been trained by sloths. When you sit down be amazed at how cold and low quality the food is, and then take it back for a refund and be shrugged at by someone who has taken customer service advice from Basil Faulty. The other amazing thing about a visit to Disneyland in Paris is how unbelievably selfish and rude the other guests can be, adults think nothing of pushing small children out of the way to be photographed with a character. Parents push their children in front of other children to do the same!!!!TOP TIPS: If you wnat a photo with a character head to the hotels, less crowds, less chance of not being trampled on, more chance of a photo without someone else in it.Bring your own food, they claim this is not allowed but staff seem not to carePark at the Disney village multi storey 10 euro for 24 hrs(less if you stay shorter), not the Disney car park 15 euros for the day.Enjoy the attractions, it still is a lot of fun!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
134775794,2,2011-9,United States,"We were very excited to be taking our young child to Disneyland Park, Paris. We had been to many theme parks and were expecting at least the same value, quality and experience. Given the price of entry to the Park, we thought that this alone reflected the quality. Unfortunately, we got none of those. First impressions are that the line to get in moved too slow. It took us almost an hour just to get in the park???!! Our first stop   bathroom. Oh Boy ... the smell was atrocious. I doubt that the plumbing was adequate to keep up with the number of tourists that visit the park. It was so disgusting that I reported it to staff   thinking that a sewerage pipe had broken. Even the staff member told me that nothing was broken, just a lot of people visit the bathroom???? Most of the rides in the park required at least a 95 minute wait and as you can imagine, young children can't wait in line that long. We went in the middle of the week; no school holidays and apparently on a  better day  than normal. Long story short, we couldn't wait to get back to Paris city away from the dreadful smells and queues. On a positive note, the grounds themselves, were very well kept & nice and green and full of flowers. In the middle of Paris City, near La Place de la Concorde, there is a little amusement park open and our child and many children we knew had more joy at this little amusement park  free entry, just pay for rides  than they did at Disneyland. Should have stayed in Paris city. But you have to try it to know.",Disneyland_Paris
134764952,2,2012-7,India,"Ok, first of all, if you think paying 60 Euros for visiting both the parks in one day is a good buy, you are wrong. You can hardly cover 15 % of each park in one day. Go there and get a ticket for at least 2 days for one park, or 3 days for both the parks. Its best if you take your own lunch, as restaurants are very crowded, and you ended having a meal in your hand but no place to sit and eat. And the meal is not cheap mind you ! Waiting times for the Roller Coasters are around 70 to 90 Minutes, and during my visit, two of them had stopped functioning for some time, a big disappointment. If you have kids, even worse, as all kids' rides have even longer waiting times, so prepare to buy a 2 or 3 day ticket, or just let the kids enjoy as you stare at them and yourself do nothing. The rides are good, but you dont have time to try all of them, as I said, 10 to 15 % maximum.Take an umbrella with you ! It rains a lot, although only in drizzles.",Disneyland_Paris
134744177,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"First, wake them up at the crack of dawn on a holiday morning. Well, as long as you have a personally addressed letter from Mickey Mouse to them. Our 6 yr old read this in his sleepy stupor, slightly annoyed that we had woken him (he already sleeps like a teenager, it's remarkable). He perked right up when he saw that he was going to Disneyland Paris (DLP) and changed almost immediately.Second, death march them to the train station. It took us longer than expected to get out of the house, so we had to hustle a bit to make it to the tube, since the walk tends to be the slowest part of the journey. After some whinging, we were on and it was smooth sailing to St Pancras and the Eurostar Disneyland Express. The train ride is so quick and convenient. We were going to fly into CDG using BA points, but after consideration we cancelled those and paid an extra couple hundred pounds for Eurostar tix, the convenience of disembarking at the main gate is second to none. Well worth the money. And door to door Eurostar Vs Airplane is no contest, well worth the extra   . I haven't costed out driving ferry, but I imagine it might still be worth it to do Eurostar.... Probably the best thing about the train is the Disney Express service. I can't recommend this highly enough; you get your park tickets on the train and then just drop bags off at the station and they take them to the hotel for you, in your room waiting. Awesome. We were in the park in less than an hour (may 30 min?) from getting off the train. It was English holidays, but not French, so I imagine numbers were down quite a bit. It seemed not at peak capacity.Third, let them eat crap! We ate DisneyFood(tm) the whole time and even did the half board option, with some meals in the park. To be fair, it was great for Disneyland. The first day we at the Blue Lagoon, the Pirates of the Caribbean restaurant. The food was a bit hit and miss, but my wife is used to expensing pretentious meals at place like the Wollesley, so she was bound to be disappointed! (Love you honey!) In all honesty, keep your expectations reasonable and you'll do just fine. Plenty of fresh veg and fruit and relatively healthy options, so you don't have to eat horrible stuff if you choose not to. Despite being surrounded by France, this is not haute cuisine   but they do have wine! I think simply for that reason, this might be my favourite Disney....Fourth, get a terrible night's sleep. We had a full half day of rides after getting off the train and had some kids who should be tired but weren't at all. Off to the hotel! Now this has all been tongue in cheek up to now, but the Newport Bay had some issues to sort. Disney is very shrewd about not mentioning problems refurbs that may be going on (or selective openings of certain things in lower periods), so we came to a hotel down one restaurant. This created breakfast chaos, but more on the redemption of that situation later.  Upon checking in, we simply got our key cards and headed to our room. Now we had paid a bit extra for something called 'Admiral Level  or Admiral Floor or something like that, which was supposedly better rooms, etc. This included a dedicated check in desk for people staying on these floors. When we got in at 10pm (post full day at DLP) the line at the Admiral desk 6 or 7 deep, while the normal check in was empty. Guess where I went.... We get on the lift and the little floor listing shows that the majority of the floors are 'admiral level' rather than not. Curious, I thought, that more of this hotel is 'special' rooms than not. Our room, despite paying for one was not on an Admiral floor. Whatever. It's Disney. Lower expectations. It's about the children, etc, etc. Open the door and the reek of covered up smoke stench wafts out. I was in, see our bags are there and all accounted for and then head back to the desk to get our room changed. Back to check in, no rooms available, so stuck in a formerly smokey room. I say stench but it was manageable and the kids' were asleep before heads hit the pillow (That terrible night's sleep thing was for me and the wife). Because we had booked this 6 months ago (6 months and we still get shafted!!), they couldn't put it back on our card, so they actually gave me cash! Hilarious, but the gal at the desk was a lovely French uni student, doing the best she could. Here's the best part: as we're waiting for a manager to unlock the cash drawer, I ask about the whole lack of restaurant situation and she mentions, Well we have vouchers for eating breakfast in the park, do you want to do that?  Uh, yes please! If you don't know, staying at a DLP hotel allows you into the park from 8 10am, which is when the gates properly open. So, eating there would be useful for sure, especially with small kids who are rearing to go anyways. So, despite not getting the room we paid for, we ended up getting breakfast in the park. It's not lavish, same that you'd get at the hotel, but it avoided the chaos that is Breakfast buffet at a disney hotel. (we had stayed at the Santa Fe like 3 4 years ago and same story, and that's without a restaurant refurb!) The beds and rooms are remarkably simple, so just realize you are paying for location. It is nice getting to walk to the parks each morning, but I'm sure I'll look at the hotels that sit on the edge of the park from proper hoteliers next time we go.Fifth, consider whether your actions are potential psychological abuse. Before I fill that in, just to finish up  4, the rest our time was great at Newport Bay, they changed our room the following day to another decidedly average (but non smoke smelling) room that was  Admiral Floor.  Whatever. Our 4 year old was on his tip toes to get into the Tower of Terror at Disney Studios. He has no fear. If you've never been, this is a free fall ride, complete with creepy Twilight Zone backstory. In the waiting area, he looked at all the creepy and macabre stuff in the mock up hotel lobby totally unimpressed. We get into the line to go on, and the family next to us has a 10 yr old daughter crying trying to back out with Mom, Aunt and older sister all reassuring her. I was starting to have second thoughts about bringing our kids on this, but our son just looked at the crying, not really computing what was going on: why she was crying or considering his own impending doom at all. After getting off, he was very excited, and ready to go on it again. He constantly referred to it as a  ride  and a  story , realizing that both the elevator and the ghosts inhabiting it were totally fake. Amazing. Hopefully all kids can separate reality from myth this well.Sixth, try to get left in France. I didn't really try. Eurostar had some issue so the direct to London train was cancelled and I sat in the train office with the slowest ticket agents known to man. Being France, when it 6pm, one gal took off, despite the line of people all needed rebookings. It's quitting time! A re route to Lille and a train change was the plan. Oh, and this was without my wife who ended up having a last minute business thing in Paris. Get to Lille with less than 30 minutes to get to our eurostar, but was told we came into the domestic terminal and of course, the Eurostar was leaving from the international one. I ran with luggage and younger child under my arm, my 6 year old running behind me, me stressing the whole time. We get to the Eurostar platform just as the train pulls in and rush down, only to realize that it is on the other side of glass (of course   have to go through customs passport control....). All the people on the Eurostar leaving for Blighty saw a sweaty, sad Dad (head hung in defeat) and two sleepy kids. It was pathetic. After all that effort a ticket agent comes to collect me, and help me through the proper line, passport control, etc. I think they took pity on me because I got rebooked into business class with the boys on the next train that was an hour away (Of course, the ticket agents at DLP failed to mention this when booking me on the train with no layover transition time at all!). So, fortunately, a well deserved glass of wine for me on the way home.All in all, DLP is amazing. It's Disney, so yes, it's expensive and we happened to pay out the nose. There are cheaper options, but we paid for convenience. I will say, that I do like the half board plus (which actually means something, unlike Admiral level), which included nicer restaurants where we could sit down. One hilarious thing was we actually happened to have reservations at Walts, the sit down restaurant on main street. Our reservations were for 7pm, which happened to be the time of some parade (didn't know, didn't care, nor did kids). But the whole restaurant with 5:30 6 reservations were nursing drinks like no other, waiting to watch the parade. So the 6:45 people were irate (the British sense of justice revolves around queuing), the 7:00 people were annoyed, we were just hungry. 7:45, parade over and the stampede out was deafening. Thankfully, they comped us the champagne we ordered as a mea culpa. So, just consider those things when making reservations at DLP restaurants. Kids were oblivious to all this, and loved every moment.",Disneyland_Paris

We visited Eurodisney on the first day in Paris as the weather was good and the day we had thought we would go later in the week had rain forecast. So I had not researched it. We arrived at 930 and walked into the park and waited for the different areas to open at 10.We proceeded to Walt Disney studios later in the afternoon, as we had not done our homework we missed the car stunt ride and the roller coaster broke down!

134695506,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"I first visited  EuroDisney  as it was then back in May 1992, 6 weeks after it opened. Back then there was lots of publicity on the TV, and despite never having visited a Disney park, I was extremely excited about visiting. I was 21 years old, but really a big kid at heart. What I found upon entering, was truly a magical kingdom, where awe striking craftsmanship should along side exciting attractions.I've visited over the years since, and now with our young family we have annual passes. I have to admit that I do miss the  emptiness  of the early years, as today it is often quite oppressive in terms of the numbers of people in the parks. But it's just a minor criticism.Since the park opened, we've visited the Orlando parks, as well as the two in California. I have to admit that the sunshine adds lots to the Stateside holidays, whereas Paris is often a little on the grey side. But there really is no where else in Europe that does a theme park on the Disney level of quality.There's plenty to do, and yes we've done the rides countless times, but it's the overall experience that we go for.Food is expensive, in fact everything in the parks is, but we often have a meal as a  treat , and do picnics on other days to keep the costs down.We've not managed to stay up for  Dreams  yet, but will be doing so in August, and from what I've read it sounds like a fantastic show.I think if you plan on going for more than a couple of days, then an annual pass is the way to go, as ours cost less than a two day pass.. you can buy in the park, or on a couple of French websites, worth doing a bit of research before you go.Some of the highlights for our children are  Pirates of the Caribbean ,  Phantom Manor , and  Buzz Lightyears Laser Blast .I know everyone says that Orlando has more to do, but the actual Disneyland park is one of the largest  Magic Kingdom  parks.. and it is one of the most expensively constructed, and the quality of the build does shine through.Have a great time.",Disneyland_Paris
134662631,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"After doing a bit of a Disney tour over the past 20 years I have finally found something to make my jaw drop!DO NOT MISS DISNEY DREAMS!!! If you have children and staying in the Disney hotels take them back for a nap and return to the park at night, they will LOVE it!!!Before the show started I turned to my boyfriend and said 'This will have to be something amazing to beat my favourite Disney show!'   meaning FANTASMIC! It did not just beat it ... it blew it away! I would go back this year just to see this show, we were gob smacked at the technology used to make the Castle do so many magical things. (I don't want to spoil this show for anyone by describing certain things ... you've got to see it to believe it!)It was extremely busy the day we went however thanks to the fastpass system (plan out which rides you can get and how you want to do it before you go) we managed to do ALL of the thrill rides plus majority of the others. FASTPASS is the best idea ever invented and the fact that it's FREE makes it so much better. The same as with Walt Disney World you need to PLAN PLAN PLAN before you go if you're doing what we did and fitting everything into one day. Find out the times and ride closures off the website and keep in touch with the Wait Time boards scattered around.",Disneyland_Paris
134661461,2,2012-7,United Kingdom,"I have never left a bad review and consider myself to be realistic but considering the hard sell about experiencing the magic Disneyland Paris was a huge let down.My partner has visired the Orlando resort and was shocked at the difference. Indifferent staff, really shabby in lots of areas, no characters roaming around to break the boredem of endless ques waiting times for rides could that did not amount to much and filthy toilets which stank of stale urine. The only thing that made it Disney were the parades and Dreams show. Even the we were hearded like cattle.We took our daughter for her 6th birthday and even she was underwhelmed. Luckily we decided not to stay in a Disney Hotel and travel in from Paris so we did not have to endure this rubbish for nore than one day and could spend the rest of our time in a civilised place. Previosuly we had considered staying in a Disney hotel, book meals and the whole shebang, thank goodness sense prevailed.Disney are unashamed in their money making. There are more shops than rides all of which sell over priced tat. The food options are limited, overpriced and of poor quality. Luckily we took a picnic and although it is stated no food is allowed most people did this. I have had far more enchanting (and cheaper) days out at Sundown, Butlins et al in the UK. Talking to other people whilst waiting for an hour for a one minute ride all felt the same. I'm still waiting to discover the Magic.",Disneyland_Paris

134634890,1,2012-7,Australia,"This amusement park is solely focused on taking as many Euros off you as you have. They allow way too many people into the park at one time, meaning that you have to wait around 40   60 minutes just to do a one minute ride. Triple the price for all food and drinks compared to Paris dining. Our children were aged 11 and 14 and the park was clearly targeted at 5   7 year olds. We won't ever be going to a disneyland park ever again even for free as it is a waste of a day.

134593423,3,2012-7,United Kingdom,Was a bit disappointed with Disneyland Paris after having been to Disneyworld in Florida on a number of occasions. The Park in Paris was not as well organised. Quite a small park in comparison so easy to get around. One always expects to queue at Disney but some of the queues were unacceptable   1hour 10 minutes to get a hot dog!!! Also a very long wait to get the train that goes around the park (advice  don't get on at the station at Main Street   badly organised). What was the most frightening thing was the crush at the end of the day for the Firework display   no crowd control at all and a disaster waiting to happen. Lots of people crammed into a small space and loads of pushchairs   I came back black and blue. People seem to lose all sense of normality whilst at Disney and just push people out of the way (or ram them with pushchairs as happened in our case).,Disneyland_Paris

We managed to get on plenty of rides with not much fuss despite the amount of people in the park. We had a one day pass so were eager to get in and get amongst it! What I will say is this however: since our last visit here, granted a good few years back, it is obvious the park needs quite a bit of refurbishment and care. While we were there three rides broke down, which compared to other Disney parks is a fair rarity. Okay so its not in the US, but with Disneys reputation for quality someone has dropped the ball a little. Litter and people smoking were also an issue, and I dont care if it is Europe, Disney parks do not allow smoking! And litter, well it must be a euro thing.

All decorated for Christmas, all attractions working and only in few was not allowed to use for my 5 years daughter. Little Cold & little rain is not a problem at all. You are nearly always covered when you wait in the queue. We always used FASTPASES (if available). Only problem we found is how to take children to toilet when you stay in the queue, and we been there and we dont know even now))) they must solve this, it was with all children, not only ours (up to 65 minutes on the attractions without fastpases).

The Food is expensive for a snack at lunch time, i brought 3 hot dogs (they are big) 2 fries and a large coke and it cost 37 euros! the Sports bar in the disney village was better value and they have an earl of sandwich there and a macdonalds!! there are water fountains so you can fill up water bottles which i did for my little boy..The queues to get in the parks at 10am when it opens is busy, they check you bags for secruity and then just before you get into the parks its another queue for tickets.. if you are staying in one of there hotels you get a pass for an extra 2 hours in the morning so the queus aren't bad at all...Overall a good experience, Take comfy shoes or trainers, my feet are still sore :)",Disneyland_Paris
134278231,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,Great Visit to Disneyland Paris. When buying tickets for the park try buying annual (passports)tickets. These are cheaper than buying a tickets for a set number of days and you get the parking free. If you get a chance to go back during the year you entrance is already paid.There are 2 drawbacks. You cannot buy these in advance but it is a very simple easy process and the staff were great and produced these instantly. Also there are certain days which you cannot go in on these tickets so you need to check dates before you travel,Disneyland_Paris

Fast pass fantastic and a must where possible, not all fast pass outlets were opened which was a bit dissapointing. We stayed at a Disney resort so were allowed to enter early which made things so much easier. Toilets seemed clean but did smell. The food was expensive but any theme park is   bring your own snacks if possible. As it was summer they had the night spectacular which was beautiful and totally worth staying up for. The rides gave you an indication of the length of waiting time which made planning easier. I'm glad we went as it was a side visit to Paris but I can see how some people would be dissapointed if they made a special trip. Just hope for a day where it's not busy, I think this would make the difference between a good and bad time.",Disneyland_Paris

There were so many attractions and you need at least three days to cover everything. Kids will also enjoy having their photos taken with the Disney characters. If you book the higher end hotels, the Disney characters are scheduled to appear in the hotel lobby for photo opportunities with the guests usually in the morning.Food is quite expensive compared to their U.S. counterpart.",Disneyland_Paris
134229459,1,2012-7,United Kingdom,"Disney Land Paris or DLP, is a tired overcrowded, overpriced dump! To start with the place is extortionate, all the souvenir shops sell all the same items and its all tat. The queues to get in if you do not have tickets already are long, very long. Once in you are subjected to loud music everywhere, very few seats and the toilets are disgraceful. The toilets are very few and far between and during our visit we did not see them get cleaned once, anywhere. The rides take a very, very long time to get on, if the sign says 40 minutes you might as well add another 20 on for good measure!!! We went on most of the bigger rides and found the only way to save time and stress was to use the fast pass facility, which was good but the more popular rides soon ran out and then the queues were upwards of an hour minimum. Thunder Mountain during our six day visit was out of action for  technical reasons  at least twice to our knowledge. We found at this time that the staff, who were normally very helpful, retreated and became non existent. The few times that we did queue, the lines went on forever, very discreet and hidden at the entrance to the ride to get you in and then the long wait begins. The few roller coasters that are there are very much the same and are very much a let down after the long wait, two minutes or less is pretty rubbish. Overpriced drinks and food, so if you can bring your own in, the shop in the train station is great compared to the park. If you like eating cardboard you will be right at home. The Mickey parade that happens, well, if you have seen it or don't want to see it again is a nightmare, people queue and block the street ages in advance and when it starts you are stuck or have a very long walk around.The Walt Disney Studio which is a lot newer, has been designed to shepherd you right past the souvenir shops, there is no other way to get into the main area. The rides in this park are also very busy. This park only had a handful of food outlets and the restaurant we used, Restaurant des Stars, was not good. Buffet style, with the same food all day every day, barely edible, luke warm and quite often with long queues.The meal vouchers which we had in advance were of some use, but, only a few restaurants give you the full value of the voucher, meaning you don't get what you have paid for. All the restaurants we used , Silver Spur Steakhouse (disgusting undercooked and like old shoe leather), Walts, and Plaza Gardens were all terrible. However, Buzz Lightyears Pizza Planet was VILE!!! Paper plates and plastic cutlery!!! If you really want substandard food you will be right at home. The food in here was vile and had no taste the floor dirty and the tables needed to cleaned properly. We certainly did not expect this substandard quality from Disney.The majority of younger children looked distressed and bored. The parents equally so. By the time my four year old son got to meet Mickey he was bored and frustated. A lot of people seem to leave their manners at the gates and charge with no regard for anyone in their way. The strollers that are available are used by some people like battering rams. We will never go back here,the cost did not live up to the return. Queues I can understand, but being herded in like animals was terrible, like the Armeggedon show. My wife visited here a fourteen years ago and the rides have not change very much if at all.Do not go here the place is a joke!!!!",Disneyland_Paris

NO ONE WAS INTERESTED. Once in arena shovelled into rows of people. Food was then served as show was in progress, some of the time in very dark lighting, which wasn't a bad thing in some ways as you couldn't really see what you were eating, but if you were hungry..you'd want to eat, but then then show was going on so what did you focus on, bad food, bad show???. And what a waste of food, how ever BAD. really please don't waste your money..the show isn't really worth it, and the food is appalling. All we came away with is 2 straw hats!!! Would not reccommend this show at all. Rest of Disneyland would say it's fine if you like queueing, amazing structures, and lots to see but make sure you plan what you want to do, and would highly suggest that you spread the day out between seeing what's around and a few shows otherwise you're feet might feel like they want to fall off...but please don't waste 75 euros per person on the Wild West Show.",Disneyland_Paris

The big rides such as Spacemountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones really live up to there standards. Get a map once you arrive and it advises the rides  not to be missed  by a tick! Really helpful! However DON'T go on the railroad train surrounding the park. Waste of time, you see nothing, blocked off by trees and has a ridiculous queue for something so boring and dull. Loads of things to do, literally spent the entire day in this park (9am to 11pm) Advice:bring a packed lunch. Food can be quite expensive if you don't look right. Didnt see much of the characters but maybe thats because I was so distracted from everything else. Be prepared for long queues and use fast pass wisely!

The queue to enter the parks was not very organized and we were not able to differentiate the lines for those with without bags. It was a good thing we managed to reach there at 10am when the park was opened, the queue was just starting to form and it took about 15 20 minutes to enter the parks. Imagine if we hadn   t bought the tickets online, another good 20 minutes (or more) would have been lost. We visited Walt Disney Studios Park in the morning, followed by Disneyland Paris later in the day. It was a day of walking, walking and more walking (we started our journey at 830 in the morning and reached back to Paris at about 1030 at night), but overall a fruitful day out. The metro RER tickets back to Paris cost about 6    per person and the train station is directly in front of the 2 parks and Village (very convenient).Disneyland Paris is much bigger than Walt Disney Studios Park; here the wait time for the rides was slightly longer from about 40 minutes to an hour. After our adventure at the Walt Disney Studios Park, we were tired and famished. As with all theme parks, qeueing up took up most of the time, but fortunately we went on a weekday and before the school holidays in early July. It is best to buy your tickets online and early too. This year Disneyland Paris celebrates its 20th anniversary so it had offers for the parks tickets and accommodation. Unfortunately for us the trip was a little last minute, but we survived.We only spent a day there (rather half a day) and managed to sit on the major rides like Space Mountain. Big Thunder Mountain was under maintenance that day so we did not get to sit it. Autopia is a ride for the young and the young at heart where you get to    drive    an automobile down a racecourse. Besides there are other rides available at the park, and there are also time slots for photos with Disney characters (Mickey, Donald, Minnie, Goofy etc...). You just have to plan your trip properly of you want to meet your favorite character and take a photo together! You can also easily get lost in Adventureland Frontierland and have a fanatical time at Fantasyland.Prices for food and snacks are in Euro and premium theme park price so it   s best not to do so much currency conversion, it   s either you bring your own or spend that money happily.For more on my experience and photos: http:  www.travelbytez.com 2012 07 disneyland paris france.htmlFor more on how to get there and what to bring: http:  www.travelbytez.com 2012 07 getting to walt disney studios park.html",Disneyland_Paris

All rides are different than in the US, so it makes it fun to see something new.The low rating is not for the standard disney experience, but the park management.The bathrooms STINK. I thought I had walked into a Men  s room. Every one was the same. Some had no soap or towels. The day was not crazy busy like in the US. Most of the sidewalk vendors were closed. Lineups were standard Disney lineups, mostly because there are not as many options. The other reason for the extremely poor rating was because of the food. It was disgusting. Poor selection, poor quality and poor taste. The 500ml drink which had a 500ml mark on it was filled to 300 mls. Cost of the food was fairly standard. You can even get Turkey drumsticks.

Stayed in the park until 11:30pm, checked in, sleped, had breakfast (good food, 4* service, but again much to crowdy) and checked out.

There is a train that runs directly to Disneyland but on the weekend we wanted to go the part of the train line where we needed to catch the train from was closed so we had to catch a train to Paris and change to another train which was easier said then done. About 1 hour and a half to 2 hours we finally got on the train to Disneyland only to get told to get off the train and all the trains were cancelled and we couldn't get to Disneyland and we wasted half a day trying to get there. So we cut our loses and went into Paris to explore. So the next day We drove cause I was not going to trust the trains again. Disneyland it's self was great apart from the queues and it's a little over priced. Our trip was soured because of the public transport let us down as the day we didn't make it to Disneyland was a beautiful sunny day and the next day we drove it rained all day non stop. Maybe a little tip if you can afford to stay at the hotel at Disneyland I recommend it because if you stay there you get access into the park 2 hours before the public and you also have access to the fast track lines throughout the park so your not queuing up as long as everyone else.

There was a good balance between English and French at the shows & instructions. We like that it was much bigger than LA's (most probably because it's younger than LA's), rides were more generous... Pirates of the Caribbean ride was fantastically long with 2 dips which the kids thoroughly enjoyed and it was long enough for all to totally immerse into the mood. Food was the usual Disney standard and service was good. Perhaps it was just before the summer peak, queues were not long and we didn't wait long at all for all rides. There was something for our 2 yo too; Toy Story Parachute ride was so enjoyable for the entire family.Our 7 yo could go on most rides except for Space Mountain   which I enjoyed thoroughly; was surprised there was even a loop and spiral in there! The only thing we didn't enjoy was the people, parents, were smoking all the time, everywhere   though tk goodness not in the queues. I strongly recommend for Disney to push for a no smoking rule to be implemented. It's a family venue, after all; although it is a European culture to smoke almost anywhere and everywhere.",Disneyland_Paris
133907126,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Went for the day to Disneyland Paris & had a great time! We only scratched the surface (as we knew we would but only had a spare day) so it was a tester to see if our girls liked it enough to go back and they loved it. The only dampner was the torrential rain that drowned us as the parade started but in true Disney style the parade still went on and was fantastic. One of our favourite memories is Pinocchio splashing us when he jumped in a puddle. Food was expensive but that's to be expected so next time we'll take our own. Great fun had by all, especially our girls who were shattered by the time we got back to our hotel!",Disneyland_Paris
133905436,2,2012-7,United States,"Our trip to Disneyland Paris today was supposed to be a once in a lifetime experience leaving my family with a memory bank full of precious memories. Instead our memories will be of long lines, exhorbitant costs, and sore legs. We purposely selected this attraction on a Monday to avoid crowds....the crowds found us despite the workday and despite the forecast for rain. The fast pass option did not work for us because we purchased printed our tickets online and the fast pass scanners did not work except at the entrance gate to the park. At least 1 ride was closed for reasons unknown after an extremely long time investment standing in line. My last complaint is about the lines. It's foolish to think you won't stand in a line at an amusement park in the summer but I believe the payoff should be worth it and I found most of the rides to be campy. My kudos go to Star Tours and Space Mountain 2, those were almost worth the wait. If you or your kids are disney fanatics then perhaps your visit will be better than ours since you can't walk an inch without disney product placement everywhere. If not, I recommend alternative parks at better rates, shorter lines, and less campy themes. I have no one to blame but myself, I knew better. On the plus side, the staff were all friendly and spoke passable English so If you need that comfort this may be the place for you.",Disneyland_Paris

A few things make it manageable for us    we took water and some food. Paris has many excellent boulangeries that you can visit before going to Disneyland    the food in Disneyland is not great, but there are many nice picnic spots to enjoy your own. Buy tickets in advance (at the Disney shop on Champs Elysee's) to avoid at least one long queue. Better still, buy tickets more than 5 days in advance (or get a friend to do that for you) and save about 15euro per person.",Disneyland_Paris
133858816,3,2012-6,Canada,The park itself was fine. The rides were good (Space Mountain here is better than Orlando) and the ride times were not extreme by any standard. I was very disappointed by the lack of food available in this place. We had the food pass for the day (one quick service and one sit down meal). We ate in Discoveryland at Cafe Hyperion and for a basic burger and fries we waited over 45 mintues for service and at the time they closed down over 10 cashiers? It was a crazy wiat time   cashiers couldnt keep up and the staff pulling together the food were bored and standing around. They really need to rework this area. Buzz Lightyears pizza in the same area was also closed on that day. We later ate in Mainstreet USA at Plaza Garden Buffet   we never had a choice where to eat   after 6 pm all restaurants closed expect for those on Mainstreet. We waited in line for over 2 hours to get it. People were very upset and most people in line up had prepaid coupons to eat there so we were trapped. Overall we lost 3 hours from our day waiting on food. Disappointing. If you compare it to Orlando's Disney you will be disappointed. Its a nice park but really lacks the service of the US parks. One last note   the Tarzan show was excellent and well worth seeing.,Disneyland_Paris
133857868,2,2012-6,Canada,"During a recent stay in England we took our daughter and her family to Euro Disney. Our grandchildren are two and four. The park is extremely expensive, example: four sandwiches and five drinks were fifty Euros or the equivalent of $75 CDN. The park itself was dirty and run down. Since the park is situated out in the country away from any town of any size, you pretty well have to stay at one of their hotels. It was rated as three stars....I would say it was greatly over rated. Faulty bathroom fixtures, broken telephone and heat blasting away on a 28 degree C. day. Calls to maintenance were ignored. I would suggest avoiding this Disney...go to one in the US, there is no comparison.",Disneyland_Paris
133845687,3,2012-7,Uganda,"My kids are still in heaven after the trip so they would rate it 10 10. It certainly is great fun, but it is really expensive. I knew that before we went, but wasn't prepared for just how expensive it was. Loads to do, many shops, many restaurants. Not as many simple healthy meal options as we would have liked. Everyone wants you to buy a predetermined meal with drink. A few things really bothered me   for a childrens theme park, there should be rules about where people can smoke. I kept having to pull my kids out of the way of careless adults walking around smoking. Also, for such a well oiled machine, the bathrooms were very dirty and smelly with very long queues for the ladies.",Disneyland_Paris
133829973,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We visited Disneyland Paris for a 3 day break so we had an evening, a full day and a morning in the park. With us we had 4 children aged 7, 4, 1.5 and 3 months. If you are staying off resort I would recommend turning up earlier than 10am as although the main entrance was quiet, there were long queues at security outside the main gate where your bags are searched. We were staying at a resort hotel so got early entry. It wasn't particularly worth it though as most of the attractions were still closed until 10am.As we went in the off season (June) many of the food outlets were closed which led to extreme queues around lunchtime and a lack of places to sit. Two of us with babies dared to sit waiting for the rest of our party to get the food as both the babies needed fed which led to us being shouted at by a member of staff even though it wasn't busy when we entered. Food was of decent quality but easily twice the price of regular fast food outlets. Toilet facilities were plentiful but very poorly maintained. There was a stench of stale urine throughout all the toilets we visited, sanitary bins were overflowing (onto the floor in some cases) and they were generally much dirtier than we would have expected at an attraction of such a premium cost. The baby facility was excellent with chairs for feeding baby, water and microwaves for bottles if you need them, highchairs for feeding baby and a clean changing area with child sized toilets. Would recommend bringing younger children here over the main toilets.In terms of queueing for rides, we found Baby Switch extremely useful for the little ones. This allowed half of our party to queue while the rest waited with the babies. We then were able to swap over without half of the party having to wait. This is available on all fast pass attractions but it's not widely advertised so ask about it. We didn't find Fast Pass particularly useful as often when busy later on in the afternoon your slot would be some 3 4 hours away and it just isn't feasible to wait that long in the evening with babies in tow. We really enjoyed the 20th anniversary parade.Having visited Disneyland in California many years ago we were extremely disappointed by the lack of characters circulating the park. My daughter had bought an autograph book and was excited to meet Mickey and various others but really the only option to meet the characters was to join the 90 minute line for Meet Mickey or the Princess Pavillion. We were lucky in that we were staying at the Davy Crockett Ranch so they got to meet Mickey, Donald and Pluto on site there instead and got to spend a decent amount of time with them.Overall we would definitely return but if it's this busy off peak then I dread to think what it would be like during school holidays!",Disneyland_Paris

133824178,1,2012-7,United Kingdom,"If this review saves anyone the overwhelming sense of disappointment, frustration and anger that we have recently endured during our trip (6 to 8 July), then at least something positive may be said of our recent visit to Disneyland Paris. Our party comprised 2 adults and 2 children (6 and 3), and lasted 2 nights, 3 days. It started positively enough with good value for money parking at the local NCP car park and easy access to the train station. Passport control was efficient and embarkation stress free. We then arrived at DLP. Our bags were left at the station and were available for collection at the hotel, so far, so good. Upon arrival at the Station, we were herded into the main shopping and restaurant area. We wandered up and down the main street looking for signs for the main parks,or someone to ask. The one employee we did find, claimed not to know where the main park was...helpful. To be fair, it wasn't that difficult to find, and entry into the main attractions was hassle free (but only with Pre booked tickets, which fortunately we had). Once inside, the enormity of our mistake in coming here began to sink   it was packed,and I mean really,really packed. Many people may be afraid to tell themselves, and their friends, that they did not enjoy their visit because of its cost, and because of the build up to something which for many may be a once in a lifetime experience. But, I can tell you, our immediate observation was that the park was filled with stressed and angry looking parents, and children in melt down: and the ratio of positive to negative comments on this and other sites is not reflective of the sense which we got of the experience people were having. So, we wandered up the main street of the main park, and there were more shops selling the same merchandise available in the shops in the area into which we disembarked   always good to have a second chance in life. Then, some restaurants, then, some more shops. At last we arrived at the entrance of the big castle, and to be fair, it was pretty impressive (especially if you are 3 and 6). A good photo opportunity taken. We moved into the area of the main attractions. I'll spare you a blow by blow account of each ride but suffice it to say, the ride to queue ratio was about 30 minutes queue to 1 minute ride. Most rides lasted for about two minutes, and we did not not queue for anything for less than 55 minutes. Do not trust the queue ready reckoners   they bear no resemblance to reality, and it was not often that this was a point in one's favour. At the merest hint of humidity, most of the rides shut down creating tremendous pressure on those which remained open, and the few play areas were particularly sensitive to the weather. I appreciate the good h&s reasons why this was necessary. The queues, and their length, were a particular problem for those attractions such as meeting the princesses where by the time one actually got to meet the princess (two on shift at any one time, and you're told who you'll see) the children were in a state of total boredom, frequently in tears, and not prepared to talk to anyone   and to be clear, this was not just (one of) my children but around 75% of the queue population   some of these will have been your friends who will have told some of you what a fantastic experience the whole thing was. The child in front of us refused to meet the princess because he was so bored, and one of ours was totally dis interested by the time the big moment came. To be fair to the character, she was very good, and one of my children loved the fleeting moment. But: in, hello, photo, out. Only time will tell if the 75 minutes queue was worth the wait , I hope my daughter remembers the event with fondness. With the exception of a fleeting, long distance glimpse of the disney princesses during one of the parades (which were fun, it has to be said) that was the sum total of access to those characters   access to them was very, very tightly protected. Indeed,the following day, we saw them make a sprint from the location of the meet and greet, to wherever was their destination   not quite ignoring the crowds but clearly uncomfortable about being seen in the open. Once or twice a day, one of the cartoon characters would make an appearance for 5 or 10 minutes, and so starved was the population of access to their favourite characters whom they had travelled to see and meet, that they were very quickly swamped by the crowd,including by adults with no thought for others. It is hard to explain,and the anger is subsiding as the memory fades, but the way the queues were engineered in itself gave rise to stress and tension. Somehow, the designers had managed to insinuate that the end of the queue was nigh, and just as we thought we were near the queue's end, we would perhaps take a corner which revealed several hundreds of previously unseen queuers, or into another room where the real queuing was about to begin. You will know what I mean if, when balancing the positive and negative reviews, you decide that only by itching yourself the Disney scratch will you be able sleep easily again at night! Toilets. Some reviewers have said that the toilets were disgusting. We did not find this to be the case but what I would say is that they were not in abundance, and neither were they very well signposted (nor was anything, for that matter). For many, this will not be a problem but for those with children between, say, 2 and 4,there is sometimes an urgency associated with these matters which is best served with immediate, or near immediate, access to such a facility! Food. The following sentence is one which I thought I would never write, nor even give consideration to writing. By far and away ......(forgive me, my fingers are struggling to input the necessary letters) Macdonalds was the best value for money (with a caveat) but more importantly by the point at which we took the decision (after a family crisis conference) wholesome and tasty meal we ate. For supper on the first day, we visited a pizza pasta place where we queued to order and pay and then queued to collect the food. I'm not sure how the chef managed to create this thing which was called a pizza but it seemed, somehow, watered down   it was devoid of taste, of constituency, of heat, of any sense of enjoyment or even simply physical fulfilment (and I know that may sound particularly ungrateful and immaterial in comparison to the plight of some, as may the rest of this review, but I would ask that it be read in context). I don't believe that water actually escaped from it when it was punctured with my knife and fork, though it may have been, but I would not have been surprised had it been. I've always thought it to be pretty impossible to get pizzas or beef burgers that wrong and so the next day (and I do feel guily about this) we had lunch at a burger bar. Again, we queued for about 30 minutes (at peak time,to be fair) and having been served then discovered that the ability of the restaurant to serve customers far exceeded its ability to seat them. We sat and ate our tepid filler on the floor outside the outlet. The food in the 'meet the Disney characters' place was the probably the worst and must have derived from the universal beast   fish indistinguishable from chicken, chicken from beef. Indistinguishable that is except in the hostility with which it was served, and the (cold) temperature at which it was served. All that said, the   30 odd per head did provide the best 30 minutes the children had across the 3 days with a good selection of cartoon characters enthusiastically visiting each table and so in that respect did provide some sort of value. Shows. The shows were good, and if I had my time again with the experience of the past 3 days, I would make more use of these opportunities. Though the queues were often excruciating one at least got 10 15 minutes of 'payback' (most shows advertised duration of 20 minutes) but at least 5 minutes of that time was spent telling the audience not to take pictures, film or do anything which may in any way infringe copyright (didn't seem so worried about telling it where fire doors etc were located). What, you may ask, did I expect? Well, I didn't expect my wife to cry in pure frustration at the overwhelmingly disappointing experience (she is a wonderfully pragmatic person and always seeks out the sitive in any given situation person) and I didn't expect the 3 year old constantly to ask to go home. I recognise that I am lucky to have been able to have experienced this, and some may say 'I would love the opportunity to queue for 90 minutes with my chidlren'. If you are lucky enough to be able to save hard to afford a holiday this year, then my strongest advice would be not to go to DLP. Long and rambling, for which apologies, but I hope this helps. The sequoia hotel was fine, by the way.",Disneyland_Paris
133819596,4,2012-6,Malta,"This park is amazing but can be quite a headache for adults with disney music and the mass of children flowing from one ride to the other. 2 values one needs are stamina and patience for queuing!! We had 4 days (Thursday afternoon till Sunday)   we started off with Frontierland moving clockwise. The Tarzan show was spectacular and the Disney Dreams breathtaking!! Again I would have to complain about the choice of food   junk! It's a pity! The restrooms are quite clean compared to the amount of people around. The staff are always present, helpful and fluent in many languages. They are child friendly and calm. I wouldn't return only because my only daughter is 9 now, it is very expensive (flights and all), I've seen it all and thrill wise there are better parks in Europe like Portaventura and Gardaland.

133787978,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"We had 2 free tickets to visit both the theme park and the Disney studios for one day, as a part of the 20th anniversary celebrations, so we chose to visit on July 4th. Even as 2 visiting adults the park was excellent, almost a little piece of the USA in France! As it was out of the holiday season, which was part of the reason we'd selected the date, it was probably quieter, but it was still quite busy nonetheless. We didn't stay on the park, but stayed in Paris, travelling to the park on the day. This was pretty easy, by metro RER, costing a toal of    28.40 for two adults from the centre of paris, and taking approximately an hour from the Gare de L'Est. The station (Marne La Vallee Chessy) is located right next to the park, and where the train terminates, so it's very easy to get to. The Disney park was what you'd expect it to be, great to look at, very clean and tidy, and quite spectacular. Food, drinks & snacks were a bit pricey, in my opinion, but again this is what is expected for a theme park. One good thing though, was that they did give out free vouchers for drinks at some places. For example, we had a Ben & Jerry's ice cream and were given 2 vouchers for a free hot or cold drink in a number of cafe's between 3.00 p.m. & 6.30 p.m. which came in handy! There were the predictable queues for the popular rides (i.e Space mountain 2 & Star tours) of between 40 & 60 minutes, so in the high season I would anticipate that this would be much longer. But the less exhillerating rides (such as it's a small world), were about 10 minutes.For the most part the weather was beautiful, except for a thunderstorm lasting about an hour in the afternoon. Sadly, the subsequent downpour tempararily closed some of the rides in the studios, but there's not a lot you can do about the weather! Fortunately though, the weather cleared up in time for the disney parade, which was at 7.15 p.m. This was quite impressive and was enjoyed by everyone, especially the children. We didn't stay for the fireworks display, at the end of the day, so I cannot comment on that.All in all, the parks are what you'd expect, very Disney, quite commercial and a little bit pricey! But it's also very clean & tidy and despite being 20 years old now, isn't really showing any signs of age..... and I'd definitely recommend it!",Disneyland_Paris

133765973,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,We had a wonderful time at Disney Paris this year. It is worth pre paying for your evening meals via the website. There are a few packages available. We chose the basic one which gave us a choice of ten restaurants. The only complaint was that one of these only opened at lunch time and another was closed completely. You can use the vouchers for your evening meal or lunchtime meal. We tended to have a picnic at lunchtime and saved the vouchers for the evening. Book the restaurant too as they get really busy. Take plenty of snacks with you for the daytime like nuts and cereal bars and bottles of water which can be refilled there.The queues can get quite big so if there is a ride you really want to go on then use the fast track system. It is really easy. Just go to the machine and put your park ticket in and it will give you a time to return and access the ride quicker. Do not miss the 20th anniversary fireworks display as it is amazing!!! Lovely time had by all!!!,Disneyland_Paris
133749896,1,2012-6,Israel,"Spent a day with my family (7 adults and 4 young kids) at Disney Paris. The entrance and setting were very promising and we were very excited about this day. The rest was a nightmare ! Many major attractions were closed for renovations. For other attractions (Peter Penn, Pinoccio, Disney train) we waited over 40 minutes and then were told that due to technnical problems we should come back later. When we came back later, these attractions were closed ! You can imagine the disappointment of the kids (and us) waiting for nothing. Toilets were so dirty, you could not use them. We did not see anyone cleaning them during the day. Cold water and ice cream are sold only at few stands, so you had to wait 15 minutes in cues for water each time (it was a very hot day). But the most terrible experience was lunch. Most of the restaruants were closed, leaving one fast food place open to serve thousands of visitors. We stood up in line for lunch 2 hours !!! I repeat, 2 hours !, in a crowded stinky stuffy room with over 500 people, attended by 8 slow, inefficient and indifferent staff. Then we had to eat sitting on the floor outside, as no available chairs and tables. EUR 150 just for nuggets fries cokes and starving annoyed kids. What a day. It seems all they care about was making more money after selling you the very expensive entrance ticket. We stood in a que of 50 minutes just to have our picture taken with Mickey, and then paid EUR 10 for each picture. The que for taking a picture with a princess figure was 90 minutes long. No one seems to run this place, or make sure people actually enjoy it. We left early, and swore never to come back again.",Disneyland_Paris

There is a lot on offer in terms of rides but e selective, especially of you only have a few days as queues are long and if you don't plan you will struggle to get all you want to do done!The shops are great but souvenirs (to be expected) are over priced.

We had McDonalds from the restaurant part   extremely pricey but we knew the whole place was going to be!We went on all the rides  my boys aged 7 & 8 were just the right height so if your children are bit younger be warned  Disneyland very strict on height and saw many children get refused rides because the staff could fit their hands between childs head and the minimum height stick!!!Us adults went on all the rides as well , we never queued longer than 25 minutes for any ride. 3 days was perfect as we went on everything there was to go on, any longer and we would have needed loads of money to just buy food and drink!!!",Disneyland_Paris

I felt like it was much more personal and less time consuming. Anyway enough with the comparisons. We absolutely loved Disney and being a huge Disney fan this was a dream come true. With this stop I am hoping to go to all the Disney parks within the next 10 years. We also went to Auberge de Cendrillon which was amazing.

133502228,5,2012-7,United Kingdom,"This was our first holiday without parents, we had booked and paid for everything ourselves and it was really worth the money. Going at the beginning of July we knew it was going to be busy, but the Cast members were able to cope with the number of people. We watched both the main parade and the studio parade and within 10 minutes of it finishing the cast members had managed to clear the area.All the cast members were really helpful and we didn't find a single one who couldn't speak English. We were in the park for 4 days and managed to get done what we wanted, but at 18 and 20 we didn't queue for the characters or go on the smaller rides. One thing we would say is that cast members don't seem to enforce the no smoking or no queue jumping, we often found young children trying to push past us, and with some it was clear that their parents had let them go off on their own. We saw one parent ask a smoker to put a cigarette out when in the queue for Crush's Coaster, so if you don't want to inhale smoke you are better asking them to put it out rather than waiting for a cast member to do so.We found that most negative reviews are picky and often written by those who have visited the other Disney parks. We have not yet visited any of the other parks, but we assume that Disney Florida will be a lot better than Paris because there is more to offer.

133493283,3,2012-7,United Kingdom,"We stayed at the Newport Bay Hotel from Sunday to Wednesday which is about a 10 15 minute walk from the Park, hotel was nice enough, room was clean, bed was comfy, food in the restaurant was average and the hotel did need a little updating TLC but it was nice enough and the kids liked it.The theme park was what I expected really, kids loved it, especially the 2 hours from 8am to 10am where euro Disney hotel guest get to access the park and use some of the rides before they let the general public in. This was also my favorite part of the day as you didn't have to queue, that said not all of the park is open, only the fantasy land bit and the space bit, which is a bit of a con as surely the whole park should be open. The park its self was nice, again needed a bit of TLC but I was looking at it through my adult eyes not my kids who loved it and thought the place was heaven. The bad bits were after 10am everyone is let in and you queue for around 1 hour to 1.5 hour a ride which then only last 2 to 5 mins maximum so again as an adult I felt like a real poor return on time, that said the kids didn't once complain about wait times. The biggest con however is the food as the quality stinks, never ever ever eat in Buzz's pizza land, also the price of food for lunch etc as 2 burgers, 1 x 8 chicken nuggets, 2 large Fanta   s and 3 chips cost 45 euros which is just a joke, it should be under 10 euros so I'd advise everyone to try and take pack lunches. I believe you could do the park in 2 days and after that the kids are creamed and you will have had enough of queuing.Tips: Stay in a disney hotel and do the main theme park day 1, go to the space theme park on the right and before the fairy castle first and do the Buzz Ride first, Space Montian, next go through the castle and then head into the main theme park and do all the rides you can from Peter Pan to the Merry go round next and then head over to Adventure Land for 10am when they open and go straight on thunder mountian. Day to go to Movie Park and be there for 9.30 when the gates open and do Crush first then go to Toy Land and do the rides there and get a Fast Pass to the Tower of Terror   make sure you go and see the Stunt Cars with Lighting MaQueen.Will I ever go back, I expect so but only for 1 or 2 days and I will not eat in the park ever again.",Disneyland_Paris
133461564,5,2011-9,Greece,"went there with my husband and kids wont say much as i believe u can imagine.....was soooo nice,kids loved it but also it was so great for us being a kid for few hours!!!loved every minute there,from peter pan to the space mountain!just cant wait to go back there !",Disneyland_Paris
133455876,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"As there are over 3000 reviews already I will try not to cover old ground too much and try to provide info that may help others re motorhomes and pets. We arrived in a motorhome and was charged 30 euros per night with an 8 am departure. Most other motorhome parking places in France charge only a few euros or even free. Toilets were dirty and there were little facilities, in fact it was simply a car park. On the plus side it certainly was conveinientand this is why we stayed.There is a pet care facility just by the entrance. We took vaccination certificates and pet passport( in English) . The dog was put in a reasonably sized cage. They do not walk your dog so we returned every few hours to let her out. The price was a very reasonable 10 euros for anytime up till 11.pm which included a feed (we took our own food). Overnight is another 10 euros. If you are in a motorhome(or even a car) I would make the effort to return for lunch. We made the mistake or buying  food  in the park. We had a sausage and chip sandwich with a bottle of warm pop for 10 euros each which was best described as just edible.The rides at the park were not impressive as rides on there own. The hype surrounding the rides built them up, but I can honestly say that judging only on the actual rides that the ones at Flamingo land are better although Disneyland does look the part and has more WOW factor. As others state queues too long( up to 50 mins on a weekday in June) and the informatiom regarding queue times both at the park and on my iphone app very inaccurate. Were the staff to lazy or too incompetent to update this information?If you want a beer, we only found them at Planet Hollywood at just under 8 euros a bottle and a bottle of soft drink or water is 3 euros.We got our tickets for free from Sky TV rewards so had nothing to lose, but if you are thinking of going and paying for tickets I would read a few more reviews if I was you. Don`t misunderstand me it`s not a bad place, perhaps I was just expecting too much.Any questions please ask.",Disneyland_Paris
133451219,4,2012-6,United States,"This park is small, especially if you compare it to the US versions. However, their Big Thunder and Space Mountain blow their US counterparts out of the water. The Star Tours is still old and outdated but it's great to hear it done in French. Phantom Manor is ok. It doesn't have much of a story line and I'm still trying to figure out what is going on with that bride. The Florida Haunted Mansion is about a Black Widow but that doesn't seem to be the case here. It is scarier since their props are closer to the doom buggies. Found that the food carts and restaurants are rarely open. I love the castle's Sleeping Beauty story inside of it. Although Pirates of the Caribbean ride was not that great, I love the area around it with the fort walls, waterfall skull and pirate ship. This are is fun for the adults just as much as for the kids. You can easily get lost in Adventureland Frontierland. The parade in the evening is a lot of fun. Dreams was cute...no  in the sky  fireworks. Overall, it's a nice Disney park. Worth stopping in if you happen to come to Paris. Short train ride away. Train Station is directly in front of the 2 parks and Village.",Disneyland_Paris
133440173,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,I would advise taking your time and if you only have one day and are trying to do both parks like we did then do some planning beforehand about what you want to see and do.The fast pass system is a great idea so that you don't have to stand in long queues but be careful you don't end up running backwards and forwards from one land to another to get back for your fastpass ticket slots on the rides. ll the rides have waiting times listed and it's pretty accurate. There is a leaflet you can pick up on the way in (and download from the Disney website) that lists each weeks time slots for shows parades meet and greets etc etc which will help you plan your day.I was glad it was a quieter day... we went on a Friday at the end of June so the queues were quite short. I'm not sure I would like to go at a weekend or at the height of the summer holidays when it's heaving with people.,Disneyland_Paris
133434942,5,2012-5,Czechia,"I saw terrible review about queues but reality was much more better, we visited disneyland in weak season,There wasn't any queues at security check 's   only people with baggage went throuth scanner. There was same queues in park (peter pan, flying elephants, carousell) but we used extra magic hours to visit this attractions, and then we moved on to attractions where wasn;t queues event during the day (buzz light year , space mountain, small world, pirates of caribean ) . Regarding the food, best option for my children is Plaza garden(they have chips), it's nice pleace there you can spend same time while waiting to DisneyDreams. In off season you have to make reservation 1 day ahead , and in regular season is recomended reservation 5 days in advance. Another place i'd recomentd is Au chaulet de le Marionnette (chips   chicken) is another food which dont surprise you. ( you get real chicken ,  and not nugets made from bones and chicken skin )",Disneyland_Paris
133434857,3,2012-6,United States,"We have been to WDW in Florida many times. We love the park and after a long trip planned throughout Europe and Africa, we thought a day at DLP would be just the thing to break up the culture touring and let the kids have a day of fun, something more like home: a Disney amusement park. However, we were very disappointed with DLP. I wouldn't recommend anyone who has expectations from their WDW experience to go. They will be disappointed. It's like another company is running the park, but put the Disney name on the outside of it. Some examples of our frustrations:1. I wanted to stay two nights at a DLP hotel, and go to the park one day. But, they included three days of parks tickets for my stay, which made the price astronomical. DLP won't sell you a room without including park tickets. I checked with a travel agent too, to try to get around it, but nope. That's how they do it there. Tickets are  included  with your stay. I ended up at a Novotel nearby (NOVOTEL MARNE VALLEE COLLEGIEN) and it was perfect. To buy tickets separately, DLP charges USA residents going through the traditional DLP website about 30 eu per day per ticket more than local European residents. Thanks to figgygirl and the tripadvisor forum, I was able to buy tickets online via a french website for a lot less money. She walked me through the process and they did work fine at the gate. I had no trouble getting into the park.2. My kids brought their pin trading lanyards along. However, most cast members don't wear pin lanyards to trade. A few do, but it's rare to see them. One cast member even said no to trading a particular pin trade request that my daughter asked for. We were shocked. At WDW, the kids were never denied a request to trade pins with a cast member.3. Fast passes were still a long await. If the ride line was 40 to 60 minutes, we still waited 20 25 minutes to get on the ride in the fast pass line. In addition, the queues to get the actual fast pass ticket were poorly organized. No actual queue system. Just a lot of people pushing shoulder to shoulder to access the machines.4. We were there the entire day, from 10:00am until about 10:30pm. We never saw a character greeting available, where the character is just standing around a outside. They did have them in the specific pavilions on the map. But, at WDW, you always see characters in places around the park for impromptu greetings. 5. They do have maps in English. But we could never find a program guide in English....the guide that lists the starts time for shows and parades. I asked about it, and a cast a member said the British kids are on holiday, so they ran out. It's disappointing that it's so poorly run that the management didn't have the foresight that a lot of English speakers are on holiday at that time so they should have more on hand. If the cast member knew that it was a big holiday time for the Brits, shouldn't the management have been prepared for that with more program guides?Overall, my family had a fun day at DLP. But, we were shocked at the lack of quality compared to WDW. It's a shame really. WDW has it all figured out and offers their guests a spectacular day. I would have thought after 20 years of doing it too, DLP would have it figured out as well.",Disneyland_Paris
133432589,5,2012-6,Saudi Arabia,"This park is absolutely beautiful. Walking in is a real treat and my daughter couldn't get enough of that pink castle. On the down side, getting through security was a very slow, unorganized drag. Not at all what I expected or have experienced from a Disney property. Once inside the park, my family and I were thrilled to get that old Disney magic feeling that we love and had loads of fun. This park is a must see for any Disney fan!",Disneyland_Paris

133411688,4,2012-5,United Kingdom,"Tiring, fun packed, enjoyable. Dream Castle Hotel excellent. Evening buffet had a fantastic choice although the breakfast was basic. Very slow at replacing food, cups, cutlery etc.Disney was expensive for food as usual but noticed that many of the food outlets were closed and therefore the ques tended to be longer than usual. Rides also seemed to be shorter than before. Staff and characters were in short supply. You has a 1 hour wait to see a princess.Try saying that to a foue year old.",Disneyland_Paris
133410600,3,2012-6,United States,"Was really excited to visit EuroDisney and got a good deal on the two park one day it was cheaper than one day at WDW. Went to the Studios first   LOVED Rock N Roller Coaster!!. The ride is even better than the Walt Disney World one   actually lifted out of my seat. Had to ride it twice!! Also thought their Toy Solders Parachute drop looked cute. Studio Tram Tour was boring and the Tower of Terror looked too clean and new. I heard louder screams on the Toy Solders ride. There was only one restaurant open   it was a busy day and the restaurants are closed? Next off to Disneyland (e.g., Magic Kingdom in FL). Beautiful entrance and it was cool seeing another castle. Big Thunder Mountain was the only ride we enjoyed. Everything else was like a B version of the original.If you are a Disney fanatic like me, I was glad I had the opportunity to check it off my list since I've been to Paris a few times and thought my niece would enjoy it. I would not go out of my way to visit this unless you have small kids.Be ready for expensive food, but that's the standard at Disney.",Disneyland_Paris

133367539,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"After reading many reviews on disneyland paris i was worried what i had let myself in for. WE went with my husband, 2 small children ages 4 and 7 and my mum and dad. It was absolutly amazing!!! was well worth the money we payed to stay for 4 nights. It was a very tiring holiday for all of us as starting at 6.30am so we could eat and be at the park for 8 then still be up to watch the fireworks laser show at 11pm! the shows and parades were well worth the queing and waiting, the fireworks were amazing and well worth keeping the kids up for. we went on pretty much all the rides and were by far some of the best we had been on....ever!! As people have said, it is very expensive but after reading these reviews i had already aloud for this. A bit of advise, pay a bit extra and go half board, then you only have to pay for one meal aday, it worth it in the end. I have fussy eaters and they managed to eat every night. There was only one negative about the park and that was there wasnt much opertunity to get autographs from the characters. we had purchesed books and pens from the park and if it wasnt for going in to cafe mickey we would of had hardly any....:( overall a fantastic holiday!!ps: prepear yourself for the most ignorant people you will ever meet, the other guests on park were quite frankly the most rudest people i have ever met!! that does not include the disney staff who were all absolutly fantastic!",Disneyland_Paris

133292893,5,2011-12,United Kingdom,"I adore Disneyland Paris! After visiting at Christmas, and having not been since I was about four five, I found it to be incredibly beautiful (if not so cold that I was actually turning blue).Disneyland Park Paris can easily hold its own in comparison to Magic Kingdom. Easily. The rides are just as fantastic, with Paris's Space Mountain being a billion times better than Florida's. Despite it being smaller than Magic Kingdom, it still holds all of the charm (and, from my experience, a fraction of the crowds). Disney theme parks are always special, because of the intricacies in every thing available to the human eye, and their attention to detail. I adore the parks. The fact that they are always fantastically clean (compared to the dingy, grimy parks that are Alton Towers and Drayton Manor). As always, the production value is just fantastic.And, as always, the Cast Members are incredibly polite, and are eager to help. The restaurants are all fantastic, catering to everyone's tastes. If anything I could say that Disneyland Park Paris pips Magic Kingdom in its charm. Overall, nobody does theme parks like Disney!",Disneyland_Paris
133277224,5,2012-6,India,"I have always been a Walt Disney fan and being in Disneyland, Paris was a dream come true !!! Now being the 20th anniversary of Disneyland Paris (DLP) , the internet tickets booked in advance were available for Euro 59 per person (20 % discount over the actual price of Euro 74).The tickets were well worth the price as everything in Disneyland was amazingly beautiful. As for those TripAdvisor users who complain about long queues.... you must understand that just like you want to be in Disneyland, so do many other visitors. So please do not complain about long queues. On a sunny summer Saturday, one can anticipate long queues. The Disney authorities have come up with  Fast Pass  system   which is a free service for the popular rides (both in Walt Disney studios and in Disney Park) wherein you get your ticket scanned   swiped for pre appointed time a little while later.The Walt Disney studios is open from 10 a.m to 7 p.m and the Disney Park is open from 10 a.m to 11 p.m   Remember to visit the Disney studios first as it closes first and has some real exciting rides !!! There are maps available everywhere   so do choose your route through the rides first and book your Fast Pass (FP) tickets at the outset itself !Every one of the Disney helpers there were extremely helpful and guiding.Don't miss the  Motors Stunt show    it is mind blowing !!! The most phenomenal stunt show I've ever seen ! Also the rides   Space Mountain, Tower of Tower, Aerospace ride are really thrilling! Super fun !!!The 7 pm parade is well worth the wait and you get to see your Disney fantasy unfold in front of your eyes. In fact, this is the only time you get to see all the Disney characters before you.One to two days is all it takes   you need not book your self for more than that. In case you are booked far away from DLP, take the RER A line to Marne La Vallee (last station) and voila   you're in the land of your dreams !!!Collectibles are priced on the higher side   but then, that's Brand Disney !!! If you wish to have a quieter time, then go on a week day...but either ways, a visit to Disney is well worth it !!!",Disneyland_Paris

133172722,2,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We had two days in the park studio using free vouchers from Sky. Unfortunately the lows probably outweigh the highs in this case. We went with 3 adults and 2 small children (1 & 3) so this review is mainly for the small child friendly areas of the park.Getting there wasn't too bad but we arrived at about 10am on the first day, BIG MISTAKE. Once you get close to the park there is a security check which took about 45 mins to get through, in the rain and constant barging and pushing in as no line organisation was in place. After getting in we had another queue to get tickets and then another queue to get in through the gates so it was 11.15am by the time we got in. We got our bearings and found our pre booked lunch restaurant by which point it was 11.45 and lunch was at 12, so we basically got to the park, got in and had to go for lunch.Lunch on the first day was with the princesses and was very up market. Veggie options were very limited (they offered salmon as a veggie option!) which was disappointing so our girls ended up with plain pasta with butter on it, but the princesses did come round and talk to all the kids, have photos taken and sign autographs which was really good. It was VERY expensive though (  50 per adult and about   20 25 for a child) so you needed to have something to justify that. (you can meet the princesses elsewhere in the park but you have a long queue and less time with them). After lunch we hit the rides which all had long queues (30 mins plus for even simple rides) but we did several of the smaller ones like Snow White, Pinocchio and used a fastpass on Peter Pan. The rides are very dark and a bit scary for young kids and tended to be over very quickly. Best ride of the park was  Its a small world  which was very cheesy but quick to get on and very impressive to young eyes. (tip: the right hand lane is fastest) We also did Autotopia which wasn't worth the wait tbh. We left early that day to see the Wild West show (see review) in the village but came back educated and much earlier the next day.Getting there at 8.40 the following day we were up and through the security and ticket queues in time for the gates to open at 9.30. The park is not fully open but you can get in and wait to get into the ride areas at 10am. We went straight to Buzz Lightyear (getting a fastpass for Space Mountain on the way) and it was great to get in with very little queuing ~10 mins. We had time for Orbitron before Space Mountain which was dark, rough and made me feel sick. Still quite early we went across to frontier land but the mine train had a huge queue so we tried the haunted house which was quite good. Lunch was looming and we had reserved a table at Mickeys Cafe for lunch with the characters which was excellent. All characters came round met the kids and had photos and the food was good and much cheaper (though not cheap) than the princesses lunch.After lunch we tried the studios (reviewed seperately) but gave up and came back to the park mid afternoon heading back up to have candy floss, do pirates of the caribbean (good ride, awful queue if you are claustrophobic ) and finally the teacups. It was then time for the parade so we headed back down grabbing dinner from the high street deli. The parade was excellent, every bit as good as the florida equivalent and a real highlight for young kids. The route gets roped off early so make sure you find a good spot about 6.30pm (you can sit on the raised grass around the main square for a good view).Useful tips: Parking is 15 euros but the RER station is right by the entrance and you can park at Val de L'europe shopping centre 1 stop up for free (good tip for heading to paris too!)Get there early! If you are not in the car park by 8.30 9am you probably won't be through security and tickets when the rides open to non hotel guests.Get a fastpass early for must do rides as it very quickly becomes hours to wait to use one and you can only have one at a time. Not all rides have a fastpass!Food and drink is expensive and there are queues everywhere. We saw many people with picnics (despite being told you can't) so I would consider bringing some bits in with you.If you have several days and have seen the parade I would consider doing big rides etc during the parade and lunch as I am convinced it would be quieter given the number of people watching the parade.As a previous reviewer said, if you aren't staying at the park to get access early don't plan on doing everything as the queues are horrific.Summary: Okay but not great and the queues made it barely tolerable. The fact that I had free tickets meant I didn't feel cheated not being able to go on half the rides despite having 2 full days there.",Disneyland_Paris
133170171,5,2012-6,Saudi Arabia,We like it!! it was a great day. We booked the tickets through their website and found it easy. The park needs more than one day to visit. The month  we chose wasn't crowded at all.,Disneyland_Paris

133094251,5,2012-6,Romania,"We've been there three times already and still it wasn't enough. We would just move there cause we know for sure that is heaven on earth! Our last visit was this June, as part of our honeymon trip. Each time we enter Disneyland, we feel like we enter another dimension. There is music coming from the sky, there is a different air in there and everybody's got a smile on their faces.My favorite attraction is Pirates of the Carribean. It's not dangerous at all. It's just funny, but not boring. My second favorite would be Star Tours, a 4D flight simulator with qa robot as a pilot. It feels like you are simply thrown out into space, the final frontier :) My husband likes Tower of Terror best. It's the adrenaline attraction in the Disney Studio Park. I am not that brave, so I would rather ride Small World. I know it's for small kids, but I just can't help it.I highly reccomend a Fast Pass, but it's a little rigid. You must pay attention to time and go there when you are programmed to. Not everything is perfect in Disneyland.

133026185,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Just returned from three days at euro disney,a party of five,two of us staying at the sante fe,the others at disneyland hotel because they wanted my grandson to have breakfast with the characters but you do pay a large premium to stay there.at the santa fe the room was fine even if we had to queue for an hour to checkin,the main down side of staying there is the bun fight for breakfast everyone rushing around with plates of rolls and ham madly making lunch to take with them to the park because everything is so expensive in there,the transfers between the hotel and park work well even coping with the rush after the fireworks, well worth watching even though we had to sit on the concrete for an hour because the place gets packed with thousands there on the evening we saw it,some of the rides seemed to have a perpetual queue best time is late evening not so many people about,now the gripes the place is so expensive for everything,the staff are to a large extent not friendly and do not seem to enjoy their work they all could do with a week in america to see how it should be done eruodisney is a very poor copy of the american expirience even if most of the children do enjoy it,and lastly we went from bristol with air france what a shambles they are they kept us waiting for over an hour for our baggage and there were only six checked cases on the flight,the baggage control seemed to have no idea where they were or where they had gone,the return flight showed it on time then we were told it had not yet left bristol so that was a hour and half late leaving,not good enough.thinking of going to disney do try and make it to the states no comparison.",Disneyland_Paris
133020782,2,2012-6,Ireland,"Overall... disappointed.We spent a day in the park with three children (6 9 and 11) and found it disappointing, despite having been there ourselves as adults perhaps 15 years ago and enjoying it at the time.I think its ideal for younger children who are not interested in the main rides   our six year old gave it  a gazillion out of a hundred  which says it all... and she was happy to go on the smaller rides where the queues were less absurd. The queues were in intense hot sunshine in some cases with young inadequate cover which is not acceptable for people with children.1) the queues for the main rides on a weekday were RIDICULOUS and systematically   heavily understated at the start points   it took us over an hour to get onto the main rides and in some cases it was listed at 30 mins. I don't mind queueing but I don't like being taken for a ride!2) the  entertainment  in the queues was non existent. Some kids has their Nintendos with them. There were no Disney figures walking about, which I seem to recall from our trip and no details of when the shows or parades included in the main guide. 3) FAST PASS is a joke unless you are very dedicated to using it and you can only use one at a time. You might be asked to come back to a ride three hours later, at which point you might be in the other park! It does cut your queuing time substantially but unless you have DAYS to spend there, you will simply not have enough time to visit even all of the main attractions...4) Buying your rail ticket and park ticket as a bundle is NOT the cheapest option in every case. Check with the information desk in Gare de Lyon. We did and it was substantially cheaper...5) There was an appalling stench of urine and worse in the queuing space for one of the children's rides   I think it was Dumbo. This was not a child having an accident, this was an infrastructural problem which the park management need to address as a serious health risk. Overall I got the impression   whether this is right or not   that they simply admitted too many people and choked the entertainment out of the place. When we asked if they would go back, the 6 yo gave it a resounding yes, the 9 and 11 yos said a resounding NO and compared it very unfavourably with Gardaland and other theme parks, which they enjoyed in previous years. Having been to Florida I don't recall similar problems there and would suggest that Eurodisney, however its branded, is on the decline. I think the intervening years   with the proliferation of state of the art video games and consoles   has rendered these parks suitable for young children ONLY and go there on the quieter days only.FWIW",Disneyland_Paris
133015129,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Do not go to Disneyland Paris and compare to Florida  you have to go and take it as a separate experience. (I have been to both many times) Yes its more expensive but you are in Paris!!!! It is a great park  the characters are brilliant (not as many Princess interactions as there could be but the other characters make up for this many times over). The Disney Dreams Nightime extravaganza at 11pm each evening is amazing  the best evening display I have seen at any Disney park   a must do!!! We did it 3 times and each time noticed something new. Stand at Frontierland side of the Castle as much quieter. The Cookout BBQ in Frontierland for lunch was fantastic   Euro 23   brilliant value for this park and the best character interactions ever  Jessie, Woody,Donald, Daisy, Tigger, Goofy   they come round the table and dance with the children to a band at the front   another MUST DO!!!! Also the all you can eat buffet at the Plaza top of Main Street great value Euro 27 for food and drinks. Queues not too bad but avoid a Saturday if you can   it's by far the busiest day and the queues very long. Get your tickets via Travel Republic  they seem to be the cheapest  ideally I would say you really need 2 days in this park to do everything.

You need 2 full days in order to see all the main shows in the studios. Note the studios closes earlier than the main park.

When the parade starts (afternoon and evening) you can't help start dancing to the Disney Parade song. The park has attractions for small children, older kids and adults. It's fun for the whole family. If you travel with children I would recommend to do some research in advance for age hight limits on the atttractions. On severeal attractions we watched children beeing rejected to go on a ride because they were not tall enough... The restaurants offers good food. The park is very clean and tidy.

Utilised it to the max. Can't believe it was free   they charge in UK theme parks. Dining options are good   but we were always on the move so burgers next to Buzz Lighyear lazer blast and Mexican in Frontierland was good enough and filling.

It is intertesting to go to the same attractions you see in the US, only, here, in French. One very important tip: go during off peak season. You will have to face calmost NO lines and staff is considerably friendlier. If you spwak, even a few words in French, don't be shy : do it! It'll guarantee you a much more pleasant stay at the park, with staff being more than happy to assit you. Do not expect the same parks you would have within the US but then again: do you expect the same if you go toa an Eiffel Tower replica in the US?

The weather was ok so that was a bonus, we went on Pirates of the Caribbean 1st and it was really good might scare young children but my little boy loved it!! Yes you have to line up a bit but you have to at chessington and alton towers too!!! Buzz light year ride good and Thunder mountain!! Food is expensive so we bought our own food in for lunch and bring your own water drinks and ate once at Pizza Planet which was nice cost about 40 euros all you can eat buffet, but we ate at the hotel one night and the western show the 1st night ( highly recomended) How i saw it is: if my little boy was happy and had a big smile on his face me and my husband was happy too!! I loved it!! My little boy wants to go again! I've been to Florida and I still enjoyed it!! Very tired at the end of the holiday!! Also you can get photos and autographs of loads if you find out where they are! If you get lost ask someone they are friendly and most speak English, be polite and brush up on some of your own French!! Get to the parades early! It stayed open till 11pm when we went beautiful fire works at night and ALSO BIG TIP do the popular rides at the end of the day! We got on more rides at night!

132729126,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"just got back from DLP (17 21 june) we had 5 days but 3 full days to do the 2 parks which was enough. i would say you need 2 days to do the disneyland park to do it fully.

132710379,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Visited in early June to avoid school holidays. Queue times were not as advertised on the boards, they would say it was a 45 min wait and it was always 60 mins... probably due to the continental way of pushing into the queues and queue jumping. Horrendously annoying! Also ALL the announcements in the rides are in French so for young children this is confusing if they don't speak fluent french. USA Disney is WAY better!",Disneyland_Paris
132667192,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Absolutely amazing, as expected. One of us had been before but the other one hadn't. Even though it was the English school holidays, the longest queue we stood in was about 40 mins (to meet Winnie The Pooh). It is just such a magical place, no matter how old you are. Every child should have the right to visit Disneyland. The 11pm show, especially for the 20th anniversary is just beyond words...we went to see it 3 nights in a row! I won't ruin it for you by even attempting to say how fantastic it is!",Disneyland_Paris
132658361,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from a three day trip with our two daughters (4 and 2 years old). They had such a good time, when it was time to go home there were tears.Bearing in mind it was still school term time the train from the UK was full. The park seemed busy but the average queue time during our time there was 40 minutes. There was ample of opportunities to meet your favourite Disney characters but our first tip is to tell your kids to HUSTLE! If they don   t there will be tears and no one will care. This is Disneyland in France where fully grown adults go without children and will think of nothing to push past  move aside  stand in front of your 4 year old child (whom will wait so politely and patiently) so they can see a guy in a suit. If like us you spend time teaching your children manners, for couple of days while you are at Disney, you will have to tell them to set them aside or they will never see anything! This mainly relates to the spontaneous character encounters and waiting for the parades  shows where there are no queuing systems. Literally adults and groups of young adults and teenagers push past all the little children to see the costumed character. Before you know it they have to go and your children are left crying and asking why Mickey didn   t say Hello but was messing around with the adults. Where I think this is sad and these adults must have lived a sheltered childhood, they have paid to be at Disney and if they want to see Mickey like the children it   s their right. All I am saying is to avoid disappointment tell your kids they will need to hustle!Otherwise there are a number of character meeting opportunities where you have to queue. My daughter managed to fill an autograph book so how anybody can say they never see any characters is beyond me. The most popular character attraction is the Princess Pavilion. The average queuing time was over an hour. Open from 10 to 5, the pavilion is a place where your little princesses can meet the Disney Princesses. Again it amused me to see adult couples queuing to do this, I find it peculiar! Children believe in the magic, and meeting a princess, one to one for cuddles, a chat, photographs and kisses for a 2 year old and a 4 year old it was certainly magical for them. You can however, only meet one at a time, per time queued. There are two different princesses at any one time and they rotate every 25 minutes. Normally they do not tell you who you are going to meet (mainly because the queue monitors do not know) but if you mention which ones you have seen already they will try and make it so you see a different one. The queue spirals up towards the centre where the princesses are, and there are some princess    artefacts    which line some of the way along with the magic mirror, but not enough to keep little princesses amused whilst they are queuing. There is no real quiet time for this attraction and people start queuing for it before it even opens. The princesses (from England) are very good. They seemed to really enjoy what they were doing and understand the joy they give to children. They remembered our daughters when they saw them again around the park and made the effort to say hello again   despite being on strict orders to keep walking and don't stop for toffee.The other newish attraction was meeting Mickey back stage of his Mickey theatre. Again this was a nice and pleasant way of meeting Mickey one to one. You get taken into a private room so there is no pressure from other people waiting in the queue for hugs and photos etc. Whilst you are in the queue you are in Mickey   s theatre and there are Mickey Mouse cartoons playing on the screen on the stage to keep the little ones amused whilst they are waiting. The 20th year light show on the Castle was amazing so if you are going to be there when this is being showed you will not be disappointed. The only downside is that it happens when it gets dark which has been 2230 in the summer months. The show starts at park closing time 2300hrs. People were starting to bag their space in front of the castle from about 2100hr however, since it   s a light show with fireworks, everywhere along main street would give you a good view. The Disney magic on parade was a little disappointing and not as good as the Disney Dreams. They have simply reduced the floats, added a few new tricks but on the whole recycled the old floats with a new song. All the staff were helpful and spoke a number of languages. I agree some of the character actors lacked that certain something that can possibly only be found at the American parks. There just isn't that level of interaction say like in Florida you may expect to see Minnie dancing to 'aint she sweet' in Mainstreet or the wicked witch dishing out insults over by the castle. We have never seen this in Euro Disney. If you are staying at a Disney Hotel we suggest you walk back. By the time you queue and wait for the busses to come (which are every 15 minutes but with the queue at closing time you are sometimes looking around the 4th bus load before you get a look in) you can be tucked in your hotel bed in the mean time. It only takes 15 minutes to walk back to one of the furthest hotels     the Santa Fe. It   s also less stressful as no one gets on the bus when some dude looses their cool and smashes the bus window because he couldn   t get on (as happened on our last visit which prompted us to avoid the buses and explore the walking route). Bring a double buggy. If you have a child still of a buggy age and have another child, consider bring a double buggy. Having the double buggy for our children certainly made a big difference to the kid   s enjoyment. They were able to sit in it in transit between the hotel and parks, the two parks and around the park and also provided as a seat for the parade. It   s a very long day otherwise! Don   t forget to bring a rain cover too! The hire buggies didn   t look practical. They only fit in one child (though some people were pushing adults around in them so they seemed quite robust) and they were simply an uncomfortable looking chair on wheels, so if you have a younger toddler they would be much more comfortable in their own buggy. Bring your own snacks and save money! A trip to the shop before your visit to stock up on sweets and snacks will save having to spend 5euros on a lollypop and such things while you are there. We took a suitcase of snacks and juice for the kids so the money saved on that paid for the little princesses to buy some souvenirs to put in the then empty suitcase to take back home. Even though we took snacks and some drinks, we still spent around 40 euros just on drinks over the 3 days. If you   re on a budget you   re probably best off eating in Mc Donalds in the Disney Village rather than in the park (2 big mac meals and 2 happy meals were 20 euros, 3 burgers at one of the other restaurants were 60 euros!!)Otherwise things like hot dogs are 6.50 euros and bottles of coke are 3.00 euros. Don   t forget to bring your own princess dress or be left being hagged for one at the park which costs 70 euros!We found the park to be nothing but clean and tidy but the toilets do let the park down. The park is now meant to be smoke free save for certain areas however, people widely smoked wherever they liked so watch your little ones don   t get burned as no one has any regard for anyone other than themselves. Smokers also take up seating areas and quite happy stand next to the kids at the parades puffing away in their faces unchallenged by park staff. Autopia was the only ride which was not working during our stay.If you are staying at a Disney hotel you can enjoy the extra magic hours and the main street transportation rides are not so busy at this time. You can enjoy a horse and carriage ride up to the Disney castle. The policies and access for disabled visitors appeared to be very good.All in all we really enjoyed our time and we had tears when it was time to come home. We are already planning our next trip for longer for next year! It will only be magical for children while they are young!",Disneyland_Paris

The Carousel was closed for several days.There were several elements of other attractions either broken or not working, e.g. Small World.The shows have been reduced greatly and there are very few left.Likewise, the parades are reduced in number and length.There exists a ban on smoking in public in France which is totally ignored in the Disneyland Park.The moving walkway approaches to the park are either not working at all or only some of the time, with repairs in progress on others, often, the direction you want to travel in is non operational.The pushing in by the local populace is as bad as it ever was; you face strategic blocking in the queues to retain your space.We had one or two heated moments during our visit which you do not experience in the US. The extra    Magic Hours    are a complete waste of time, only one small area is open in Fantasyland and not all the rides were operating! Some of the toilets were disgusting and obviously not cleaned. Food is dearer wherever you go in the park.And FinallyThis will be my last visit to this resort, not because of age, ailment, ability or financial limitation, but because I am sick of the rude, arrogant, pushy, ignorant foreigners that proliferate in this place. Instead I will be going to the US at the earliest opportunity for my next visit where they are more friendly, fun, polite and courteous to each other.I feel the Disney Empire may soon lose the    French connection    and the support of the many influential businesses that put their name to Disneyland Paris e.g. Lever Bros; it   s going down the pan, just like its currency.

Over the years I've taken my kids to Disney Word and Disney Land in the US, so I thought it was about time I tried Disneyland Paris.The place is horrible. Its the saddest place on earth. The staff are miserable and rude, there is none of the cheer and happiness that you usually find at disney parks, instead you get sullen french workers who never smile and make no effort to interact with the children. A number of times i heard them being rude to guests in french (thinking that no one could understand them).The entrances is a mess, with workers standing around blocking entrance gates and demanding you hand them your tickets so that they can insert them in the slot. Iin addition anyone entering with a wheelchair or pushchair has to wait for several minutes for someone to open the access gate and then manually turn the gate. Ridiculous!At the entrance there are also bag searches, but this is completely pointless as they dont search the bag properly. Its all for show.The exception to this is the costume characters (mickey etc), who pose for photos, but they only appear two or three times during the day and for about 10 mins, so its chaos as people push to get their photo. The park is 20 years old now, and its really showing its age, Nearly all the rides kept shutting down mid ride (such as the buzz light year ride), and in the event of rain most of discovery world shuts.The highlight of the day is supposed to be the parade, and be warned as it will be crowed. The parade was acceptable, but NOTHING compared to the ones in the US.I really cannot stress this enough, DO NOT GO HERE, save up and go to the US parks instead for a true Disney experience. Your kids deserve better than this. It was Disney's biggest mistake building it in France, and it is no suprise that its not making them a profit.",Disneyland_Paris

132556067,3,2012-6,United States,"Disneyland Paris has great rides and a wonderful Main Street, which all seem very similar to the rides at Disney World's parks in Orlando. The employees however don't seem to have gone through the same training as they did in Orlando. I knew it would not be the same as Orlando when the lady, Christine, in the ticket booth was unfriendly, had her name tag on vertically and was very slow. The next set of employees my family encountered was at the restaurant near Space Mountain, Cafe Hyperion. They did not want to stop talking to each other and take our order then acted like we broke up a party when we asked if they were open. The floor was so sticky that I lost my appetite because I had to guess that the people who were responsible for cleaning the food service area were also responsible for the kitchen. Later on at dinner time we went to the Blue Lagoon restaurant next to the Pirates of the Caribbean. The hostess was very friendly but the good moods stopped there. The waitress came to our table and asked if we were ready to order, nothing else, no nice words or asking if we had any questions. She never asked if she could get us anything and she never smiled. Also, the men's room at Blue Lagoon was dirty and smelled like it had not been cleaned in days or weeks. So then around 8pm my kids wanted some popcorn so I tried a couple of the vending stands but they had closed, so I went toward Main Street and found one open. However, the supervisor was in line and told me that he was closing the vending cart after the next customer. I said that I just wanted popcorn and I pointed out that they had a popcorn right there and I had my money out. He would not go for it. That seemed very odd for a Disney employee, or anyone interested in there customer.So overall the rides were fun but it was more like a local amusement park rather than a place run by Disney.",Disneyland_Paris

This time not only confirmed to us how bad it was, but set a new standard in awfulness.At 10.45am the toilets closest to the entrance were covered in filth. the pan, walls floors, everywhere, and it was apparent that these toilets had not been cleaned for quite a while.once inside, most of the concession stalls, and some of the major rides were closed, even though it was a bright day.The only park staff we saw all day was a cleaner using his broom as an excuse to hide behind a popcorn stall to have a sneaky smoke.But the worst of it all was when we wre queueing at a food outlet to here the people behind moan about not seeing a single disney character all day. his words were it's almost llike they take your money, herd you inside, then let you fend for yourself. Sentiments echoed by several others in the queue. One family had saved up for a year to go there and their two infant children were still asking when they were going to see a Mickey Mouse, or DonaldI said it before, and i say it again. i shall not be going there again.",Disneyland_Paris
132554334,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,LOVED every minute of it. It is a fabulous place and we will be back.    Could do with a bit better selection of food and toilets weren't as clean as they might be.,Disneyland_Paris
132540624,5,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Excellent park, busy during summer, lots to do, great shops and plenty of places to eat. Try the flavoured popcorn, they do odd flavours such as gingerbread. Casey Jr and the storybook ride are often closed in low season, so if these are a must I recommend you go during summer. If staying at a Disney hotel, use your EMH to make the most of your trip!",Disneyland_Paris
132518718,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We are 2 adults and 3 kids age 11, 9 and 7. We will go back again when the youngest child has grown taller so that we can take all the rides. The main ones that we missed were space mountain and the temple of doom style roller coaster. Be prepared to walk and walk, and eat plenty so that you keep your strength up. Force yourself to take rests, as you and the kids will be like unstoppable trains roaring around the park too excited to stop. Food and toys are very costly, but if you want to eat in any of the themed resturants, book before you arrive to avoid being turned away. By the way hotdogs, in Universal studios, from the hotdog stand is quite reasonable, huge and filling and very tasty. We wish we had known this from the start. Be clued up with the fast pass system, as we weren't until the last day. Fast pass does not work in the Nemo ride in universal studios and we had to wait and hour. Take a small waterproof rucksack with you with mac in a pac, and a drink, just for you to sip as your mouth gets dry with all the walking. Take painkillers too for headaches and aching legs with the kids.",Disneyland_Paris
132516525,2,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We went in the UK half term with friends so it was expected to be be kids around, the characters I saw were 2 Princess' going onto a break and Minnie mouse with a huge queue by a limosine (Apart from the parade). This is not what i expected from a Disney place. The food although is on teh expensive side it is no cheaper than general Paris prices   expect 2.99 Euro for a 500ml bottle of soft drink in and around the park. There were lots of rides not working and the majority for adults so felt this limited our activities. The studios were alot better for older children and adults and would recommend the Horror hotel rides for those that love the scarier rides. As adults we managed to do both parks between 11 and 6.30 with all teh rides we could go on and then settled to watch the parade. The Parade route startes getting busy about 6 so if you want a good spot get there early could see a lot of dissapointed people turning up just before 7 and not getting a viwing space they wanted.The trains are frequent and buying tickets was not an issue.",Disneyland_Paris

132464421,5,2012-5,United Kingdom,"Excellent trip to Disneyland Paris for myself and my daughter (6). Don't worry about travelling alone with children, it is a very safe place. We flew from Leeds Bradford which got us to Paris CDG in one hour 15 mins. We wanted an adventure and to catch the TGV fast train. We arrived at Terminal 3 so we had to walk a little through a tunnel then get a shuttle train (free) to Terminal 2. Buy your TGV tickets from the ticket booth at the train station. This is the fast train which takes 10 mins to Disneyland. No one checked our tickets so we could've saved 40 euros. You could also take the VEA red disneyland bus but this takes over an hour but it is   30 for an adult and one child one way.When we got off the train, we were at Disneyland Paris. Go outside and find your free bus to your hotel. We booked the Santa Fe Hotel. It was the cheapest. A free bus takes you to the hotel which is every 15 mins and takes about 5 mins. Couldn't actually believe how easy it is.We purchased food vouchers in with our package so we ate from the buffet in our hotel which was great and at the buffet at the Plaza gardens. Disneyland Paris is divided up into 3. Disney Village (restaurants and entertainment), Walt Disney Studios attractions and shows, Disneyland attractions and rides. There are water fountains everywhere so take some empty bottles and save money on buying drinks. Lunches were around 6 euros for a kids meal so it's not that expensive if you go to a sandwich bar in the disney village.Try going out of school holidays and midweek. The longest queue we had was around 20 mins. I have known people queue for over an hour for a ride. Not me. Take advantage also of the fast pass system. Get a ticket and go back at an allocated time. and walk straight onto the ride. Make sure you watch the parade at 7pm at Disneyland main street and the firework show at 11pm Disneyland Sleeping Beauty's castle. People start queing an hour before, but to be honest we slotted in no problem without sat waiting.Hotel Santa Fe was ok, reports are that all the hotels are a bit dated. Ours certainly was. If I had been going for longer holiday then I would have got a hotel with a pool and more to do. I wouldn't recommend going for more than 3 4 days as the queing and crowds I know have ruined it for some people. 3 days was just enough for us. On our return out of convenience and time we caught the VEA disney bus straight outside our hotel to the airport. It took an hour and was 31 Euros for an adult and a child. The staff at Disneyland are the best we have ever encountered. It is all so clean, very child friendly, safe and the staff are so pleased to help you have a good time. A rarity these days!Go on book it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
132461734,5,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Such an amazing, magical  atmosphere. Been twice and never seen a ride broken down. The staff and characters are so freindly. Shops and food prices are decent. The parades are AMAZING. Great place for all the family!:)",Disneyland_Paris
132442010,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Usual high standards you expect from Disney, park is clean well equiped and maintained, staff are friendly, facilities are good. Some queue times a bit long but what do you expect from a Disney park.Its a smaller version of the American parks, so dont expect the same size and wow factor, but still every bit as good.",Disneyland_Paris
132422402,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"We spent two days here in April, a day in each park. This was the best park and if you're visiting for more than one day I would recommend that you visit the studios first as you may be disappointed with it after this park. Nothing beats the look on the children's faces when you enter through the gates and see Cinderellas castle for the first time. We had pretty awful weather but, surprisingly, it did not spoil the day and it was really cold and bucketing down!  Of course queuing is no fun for anybody, especially young kids but it's just what you have to do so tough! There's really only one negative experience that we weren't expecting and that was my 6 year old daughter trying to get through the crowd of adults to get minnie mouses autograph, Seriously the only personal experience I can liken it to was being in the mosh pit at a Metallica concert. Some adults (apparently unaccompanied by any children) were shoving other peoples children out of the way! We did manage to get her autograph but I had to be brutal!! All in all though, we had a terrific time and can't wait to go back as our one day in this park just wasn't enough",Disneyland_Paris
132399961,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Came here with mixed reviews from friends and trip advisor but wanted to judge for myself. Had heard it was mucky, rude staff and not much to do  glad I went to see for myself. We had a great time. I have been to Disney Florida 4 times so knew what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. When the sun was out it felt as if you were in Florida!!! Took my two boys 3 and 1 yrs and this was perfect for what they could cope with. Park very clean, rides great, didn't wait longer than 10 minutes for any ride! Staff were very polite to non  French speakers! Restaurant staff great especially with kids. Ate at Blue Lagoon, would thoroughly recommend. I had swordfish  delicious!, hubby had steak, again lovely. Kids meals delicious and served on Mickey shaped plates. Cannot understand how anyone can be disappointed with the whole place. Wished we had stayed another day!!!",Disneyland_Paris
132385757,3,2012-6,United States,"I think any kid will enjoy a trip to Disneyland pretty much anywhere in the world. It's hard for a young kid not to enjoy Disneyland. We brought our daughter here several years ago and this trip we have a second child. They both enjoyed the Park but the negative posts are spot on target.Generally the employees there from the restaurants, to just walking around or in the shops seem to really need some better customer service skills. Many seem grumpy and just not happy. We experienced that in the buffet restaurant as well as a few other areas.You wouldn't know there was any European Union crises going on from the crowds here. Very busy from people all over Europe. One thing annoying is you might have to stand in line 45 minutes to take a picture with Winnie the Pooh but part of the long waits results in the fact that they insist on having the official photographer take photos, in the hopes of trying to sell you a    15 photo. It's annoying in this day and age where EVERYONE has their own digital camera that I can't imagine anyone would buy photos unless it was poor lighting conditions like in the Mickey Mouse theatre where they had some weird set up even with flash on the camera the photos didn't turn out right. Also annoying they wait until 7 PM to do the main parade. Years ago, they started earlier. It's almost as if they want you to stay in the park longer to eat, buy stuff, spend money. Our kids still had a great time there but it's no where near the quality as Disneyland related parks in the USA.One thing I'd highly recommend is they have some option to get a deeply discounted ticket if you buy a ticket ahead of time with at least 5 days notice. We are in Paris for one month so this wasn't a problem for us. We were in the Disney store on Champs Elysees and in the basement level they have a stand where you can buy tickets. We were buying tickets there so we didn't have to cue in line at Disneyland when I saw a sign that said it was only    35 each rather than the    72 or so they wanted if you buy normal tickets.I think they also have this option online so you should definitely take this option if you can plan ahead. It's a big discount to the regular prices and I'd think anyone coming to Paris could easily plan ahead. The only downside is you MUST use it the date you pick. If you are sick or it's raining or whatever you can't change the date so keep this in mind.",Disneyland_Paris
132383301,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"So its probably an unfair comparison as i went to disneyworld florida 10 years ago, but the fact is this place really dosent even compare to alton towers!!! As a big disney fan taking my 4 year old daughter for her disney experience it was a great disappointment to find that there really is no disney magic here the rides are mediocre if even open. we did however enjoy a few parts such as the disney dreams show at 11 that was fantastic and the tarzan show in the far back corner of frontier land was pretty good. the whole place was really quite depressing and disorganised with queues 90 mins long to meet a princess not of your choice and extremely rarely that might be rapunzel (i literally had to beg and plead for my lo to see her!!) if we were to do disney again it would most definitely be to go to disney world sooooooo much better its unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris

The parades very nice, the small world attraction excellent,dreamy!!

132313523,1,2012-6,United States,"We live in Orlando, got married at Walt Disney World and went to London, Disneyland Paris, and Paris for our honeymoon. We were at Disneyland Paris June 4&5. Getting off the Eurostar there was no signage telling you which direction the hotels were and no cast members in the station to give you directions. Express luggage service there but we were never offered the service even being hotel guests. Pouring rain we finally found out we needed to walk through The Disney Village or find a bus which we didn't know where. Arriving at the front desk of Sequoia Lodge, on our honeymoon we were quickly given our passes and room cards. Cards didn't work, back to the front desk, with attitude, staff returned with new cards, to our mediocre room. Breakfast room crowded and very noisey. We found the parks were lacking in customer service when we asked questions we were given wrong information, we looked for fast passes on fast pass attractions, they were not being given out and we were told to queue for 55 minutes. Went to eat dinner at 7pm the park was open till 11pm and the 4 restaurants we tried were all closed. Attractions closed early or closed all day without notification, Crowds there seemed to only understand that pushing and shoving was the only way to get to where you were going. We never heard excuse me or I'm sorry after knoching you literally off your feet at times. We are used to crowds, we go to Walt Disney World probably once a month but these people were rude and didn't care. Attractions were OK some were the same and some were different. Everything very expensive, hotel, eating, tickets and souvenirs. The best part was the nighttime show at the castle even though we were told it started at 10:30pm by several cast members,it really started at 11pm. We had to go being Disney fans but I am very sorry we spent the money we did going there. My advice skip it and save your money to go somewhere else. I wonder if Disney Worldwide knows the bad rep that Disneyland Paris is giving them.",Disneyland_Paris

132289847,3,2012-5,Philippines,"This is the third Disneyland Park that I have visited. The park is better than Disney HK but best for me would still be Disney L.A. My tips are as follows: 1.) Book in advance at the official website. We availed of a special promotion for reduced price. Validity is 1 year. 2.) Go early! If you want to avoid lines target to be there by opening time, which is 10am. The ride at RER A take 30 35minutes. We had to wait for 20mins before the RER A train arrived. 3.) Be ready for lines, lines and long lines. Plan the attractions you wish to visit. Target the most popular first before the crowd swarms in. The train that goes around the park is one of the things you should do first. Even the lines in the food court are frustrating! 4.) Check for closing times of Disneyland Studios! We were unaware that I closes way earlier than Disneyland Park. As a result, we ended up staying for less than 30 mins only.",Disneyland_Paris

The Parks were clean and still running well considering but the only dissapointing thing was that we missed some of the shows because they were closed the day before we arrived!

The Parades are excellent and well worth watching but the fireworks at 11 pm is not really worth staying up late for. Disney Studios was a disappointment. Not may attractions and a bland atmosphere.Food prices are outrageous   so take your own picnics. Buy your tickets on Eurostar   15% discount. The Hotels will charge you for 2 persons for 2 days   220. Buy at a discount with the Disney Packages. Do not stay at the Disney hotels   very costly. Other hotels like Dream Castle are only 5 minutes away by bus   free. Go to Disney Florida if you want good weather   it rained every day during our visit in June 2012.

132234221,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"My Husband and I took my 8 yr old niece to Euro Disney stopping in the Newport Bay Club Hotel for 4 nights. The hotel was very nice, some of the decor was a little tired, but considering the traffic that goes through I was pleasently supprised. We had no problems or waiting at reception  check in or out. The breakfast rooms were busy as you would expect but well organised and we managed to get what we wanted and get out to the park in a relatively short time. IMPORTANT our flight home was at 12.55 so we got the 9.05 bus from the hotel, the leaflet we had from our travel agent was a little missleading as it implied there were several busses within 5 mins of each other when in fact the next bus was 10.35. It took a stressfull 2 hrs and 40 mins from leaving the hotel to getting through security. Having to get to another termianl building, locating the check in desk then having to get a train link to the security and check in gate.The prices of food and drink in the park are what you would expect for a captive audience, very inflated. I went armed with sandwich bags and made a sandwich at breakfast for lunch. Also took some chocolate biscuits from home. We found that even the more expensive eating places was basically burgers fries and pizza. If you want to eat in one the park restraunts book early. We went to the Character Breakfast and Buffalo Bills wild west show, both were good again expensive but nice as a treat. The parks and rides were on the whole well organised, however on one occasion there was no  cast  supervising the Rock and Roller coaster. We were waiting in trap 1 and 2 (being the first car) for the barrier to open to get on the ride when an Italian girl came from no where jumping the que and pushed my Niece ( who is a small age 8) out of the way so she could get in the first car. Her tactic did not work ! Most people waited in a que, but some have not grasped the concept of waiting their turn, and pushed and jossled. This was very anoying. If you read the reviews you are fore warned, I did and it did not put me off. I am glad I went.",Disneyland_Paris

132225061,5,2011-7,United Kingdom,"We have been several times to Disneyland Paris and stayed on site in several of the hotels.Good points of the park are: it will always be a magical place to both children and adults. The theming, the costumes, the shows and parades are all fantastic. The staff are good and are able to speak several languages. Hotels are within easy walking distance of the park and the shops are just wonderful with beautiful items for sale. If you go by Eurostar it couldn't be easier  the train stops at the park gates and your luggage is transferred to the hotel. We celebrated my son's birthday here in the Golden Nugget Saloon with a pre ordered cake. I can highly recommend this, it was all done so well and he had no idea. We pre paid for food coupons which were widely accepted and helped with holiday budgeting.Bad points: the queues, if you want to go on the rides, can be very long and very tedious with small children. The prices of food and drink are high, making all you can eat buffets a good bet. Of course, it is in Europe and so sometimes we are at the mercy of the weather, so make sure to take plenty of warm clothes (I went once at Easter and it snowed.)Overall a lovely place and I will go there again.",Disneyland_Paris
132216938,2,2012-6,United States,I would expect that all the D Parks would have the same quality as found here. But what was disturbing was how many of the primary attraction were under repair. This forced us on to the less desirable rides with longer wait times. Compound that with the policy of pulling the FAST PASS off line. So what is the point of buying the hotel package with the FAST PASS only not be able to use it. I think that comparing it with CA and FL parks this one will rank as; Buyer Beware,Disneyland_Paris
132215783,3,2012-5,Belgium,"So I had promised my girlfriend's nephew (5 years old) that if he did really well in school (he lives in Almeria, Spain), he could come to Brussels to visit us and I would take him to see his long time idol.... Mickey Mouse. For the kid, was a great day, for me.... bhoooaaaaaa.... ok I guess. First off is the roadsigns... could you do any less signs on the highway saying Disneyland is here. Secondly, if you finally get to the town of Marne le Vall  e, there is no clear indication as to where the park is (i'm not kidding), I had to go into a boulangerie and ask. Prices are prices, and of course when you see the smile on a kid's face you pay whatever entrance fee they slap on you, so yes this is expensive. But.. I remember when going there a decade ago that all Disney character where running around the park all day and you could see, feel, sing and dance with them everywhere. Nowadays, you have to be lucky if you catch any of them and then your kid might.... just might.... get to take a picture with them. Quite funny to see an obese English woman shove her three young children into Minnie Mouse's face with one hand, take the camera in front of her eye with the other hand, hold off the other parents whose place in line she had taken with her back and then act like all this was normal. Oh and stay away from Woody's famous hotdogs... not worth the 5     per dog. Other than that, the kid had fun, we got to ride the train and there's a great picture of him with Mickey Mouse (we just had to stand in line for an hour to get it).

The cues are HUGE and during lunch many of the counter service restaurants were shut and at snack time the icecream and other snack counters where shut! where is the sense in that? but the park is great, my kids enjoyed it a lot! ** was it just us or do they not have enough characters roaming around?

132165634,5,2012-2,Egypt,"I've been to Disney park twice so far and definitely I never get bored of it ! The first time was in August 2009. Of course it was at peak and it was too crowded and we had to wait in long queues but, it was so lively. Also, the finale of the fireworks was just the perfect ending. Of course it's impossible to visit both the parks and studios within the same day at peak if you really want to enjoy. Of course you need to start with the rides that are highly recommended first and which are shown in the brochure and the plan you receive at the entrance. Don't miss the shows in the middle of the day and of course the farewell show. Moreover, check the itinerary in the brochure to know the times the characters appear and where. The shops displays are super attractive in a way that will make you feel you must buy gifts there whatever your age is. Also, there are places to eat there for different prices if you want a place to eat at. But, I'll have to say that my second visit was in February 2012 in which it was a bit chilly. It was almost empty and there were no queues but, some rides weren't working and the closing times were much earlier than summer. The characters didn't appear except in the final show. I had heart break to know that there were no fireworks. Also, I forgot to mention that it's always better to get your tickets through Disney store in Champ elysees to avoid the queues but, you can always check the website for any offers and discounts.

132162721,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"My boyfriend and I spent four days in Disneyland Paris starting on the 4th June 2012. Firlstly my advice is to wear comfortable walking shoes because although I was wearing trainers, my feet ached like hell after a few hours of walking around. The disneyland parks are very clean, everywhere you look a member of staff is cleaning the area. There are lots of rides for kids and adults but the queuing system for the adult rides is more than questionable. Many people jumping ques entering into the parks or for rides, at one point after queuing for nearly half an hour for Space Mountain, we noticed that another 2 ques were filtering into our que which caused bottle necking and confusion and more que jumping by others.....staff don't seem that bothered even when people are pushing past quite violently just to get to the front! One of the rides we went on was Phantom Manor. This was a bit disapointing for us as the whole dialogue was in French with no translations so you had no idea of the story behind what you was looking at and why!?! Either brush up on your French or just go with the flow, and this was also the same for the Pinocchio ride as well. It also rained on most of the days while we were at the park and of course Disneyland Paris did not think twice about charging people 10    for poncho's you wouldnt even pay   5 for which leads me on to the next subject,Everything in Disneyland Paris is EXPENSIVE!!! Typical evening meal for an adult is about 25    per person, your looking at about 16    for a child and this seemed to be the same price range no matter what restaurant menu we looked at. Burger, fries and a drink will set you back about 10    and its not exactly fast food as we waited in the que for over 30min for a cold chicken burger and the staff got the order wrong. There is a Disneyland village and I would strongly recommend that if your wanting more options for food other than burger and fries, go there. It has sandwich shops, coffee shops, other snacks and even a McDonalds which is quick and not too far from the price you would pay back in the UKIt appeared to me that no matter what shop you walk into, they all sell the same thing. All the shops sell the Disney hats, dolls and all the usual gift items and again this is when your pockets need to be the deepest........expecially if you have kids. Micky Mouse coffee mug 11   , small Micky Mouse doll about 25   . I did see a child carrying a large Micky Mouse doll and when I was in one of the larger stores, I saw the same exact doll which was 75   ........ouch! T shirts, dolls and toys are a plenty and for the Disneyland experience,                 is key.If you have been lucky enough as a parent to stear your child away from the excitements of the gift shops, there are actually lots of rides to keep your kids occupied and happy but its just the length of time you spend in the ques that a pain so parents please keep taking a deap breath and keep calm when the kids are getting fed up and bored of waiting.Things that are a much see was the Disneyland Parade which was at 7pm, a bit on the late side if you ask me BUT BUT BUT......you much find your spot to sit on the pavement along the parade route about an hour before it starts or you kids may not see the parade due to the crowds and I do mean crowd of people that line the whole route and you can not have your feet on the road at all which is why you need to have enough room on the pavement to sit. Kids and adults will love it but again, its the waiting that gets to you. Once the parade starts, people will push and shove trying to take pictures and to squeeze past you so mannars and politeness will and does go out of the window. Also the fireworks are awsome but again this is at 11pm at night which is really late especially when you have been in the park since the morning, your feet are on fire and your kids are nearly sleep walking because they're so tired BUT if you can make it through the feeling of exhaustion, it is well worth seeing and bear in mind that for this it dosent matter where you sit or stand, you will be able to see everything as long as your can see the castle. The shuttle bus porvided free is nothing but joy to experience. During the morning and afternoon the buses do get quite full and again there is no system for queuing. People will push and shove like its the last bus in the world and when we had to get on the bus after the firework show, the crowd for the buses got quite nasty and I was nearly pushed over by the people at the back of the que, I was actually quite scared and my boyfriend had to pull me out of the way because I was being pushed into the bus door hinges. I have to say that there are a lot of parents with pushchairs who just ram into the backs of your legs.......again mannars and politeness out of the window and this was French, English and all other nationalities behaving in the same way. People did not care who they hurt in the ques and this was the worst thing for me.Top Tips1) Bring packed lunches2) Wear comfy shoes3) Be patient when kids get stressed4) Have plenty of     and budget how much you are wanting to spend each day5) Take a rain coat that can be folded up small, if its raining here in the UK it will most likely rain in Franch too6) Eat in the Disneyland Vilage, far more choice and you will most likely get served quicker7) Make a note of where the toilets are, for some reason they are few and far between and darn hard to find",Disneyland_Paris
132156269,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We booked a stay at Disneyland Paris complete with tickets to the parks. We stayed in the Sequoia Lodge which is about a 10 minute walk around the lake to the parks. Having never experienced the US Disney, I had no preconceptions. The weather for our 4 day stay was on the whole quite wet (apart from one glorious day) but we didn't let that dampen our enthusiasm. I found the atmosphere in the parks wonderful and every single member of staff we came across, from the character actors to the man who kept the upstairs of MacDonalds tidy was polite, friendly, and enthusiastic in their jobs. Although I've read reviews that some areas of the park appear dated, I'd say it only really applies to the food Village. The park itself seems incredibly well maintained, even down to the planting (I didn't notice a single dead twig anywhere despite heavy planting). The pavements were absolutely spotless. If a child so much as dropped a piece of popcorn a man with a brush seemed to appear from nowhere to sweep it up.We travelled with our tiny 3 year old daughter who despite being well under a metre tall found lots of rides to enjoy. She was a particular fan of the Buzz Lightyear ride where you get to shoot aliens from your little car.Booking to have a meal at Mickey's Cafe is an absolute must. It's incredibly popular and unless you book you'll struggle to get in. We ate there twice. The food is good but the real reason to go there is the atmosphere as various characters appear in the cafe and do the rounds of the tables having their photos taken with the children (and their parents!) and signing autographs. This meant we avoided a lot of the queues for character meetings in the park. The rides in the park are very well attended by staff and signs at certain queue points indicating waiting time so you can easily work out how long you will have to wait from a certain point. There are also fast pass tickets for very popular rides.The light and firework show at park closing time is an absolute must, even if it means keeping a small child up until 11.30 pm. We hired one of the park buggies for that evening. It was amazing. The only small disappointment was not having done a  princess  meet and greet. Whenever we passed the princess area the sign either said  no royal audience at this time  or 120 minutes waiting time. We would definitely go again as I'm sure there were lots of things we could have done but didn't. Four days isn't quite long enough, especially when you take a couple of hours out each day for a nap (parents included!). Seven days is probably about right if you want to do absolutely everything. Be aware this not a relaxing holiday. You walk for miles and miles each day but it's worth it. I loved every minute of it, despite the rain.",Disneyland_Paris
132140722,2,2012-6,Guernsey,"Rides were great but after queuing for an hour and to be told the ride had to close due to technical problems was very very annoying. This happend 3 times in one day so it was very frustrating. Several of the rides were closed at half term which I was surprised at. Food very expensive, no coffee shops .",Disneyland_Paris
132124324,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"As second time visitors we had some difficulties last year despite some basic research and we didn't get to see as much as we would have liked last year so this year I did quite a bit of research   the best book was teh unofficial guide to Eurodisney by far. Timing and planning is critical   much more so than Florida where you have a number of parks to choose from and can take several days to do so. We chose a much quieter time than last year away from the main holiday periods and decided in advance what we wanted to do and see etc   we actually managed to get nearly everything in within our 3 day stay.Tips   use the FastPass system, be prepared for the weather and dress appropriately, plan your food and drink stops and which restaurants otherwise you could be in with a very large bill indeed. Be prepared for crowds, queues, foreign guests pushing in front of you and your children (forcefully so at times) and as usual keep an eye out for pickpockets and scammers   we saw a licensed taxi attempting to charge a lady 50 Euros for a 10 minute journey.",Disneyland_Paris
132117396,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"I recently spent a 5 night break at Disneyland Paris with my wife and two children (4 years old and 1 1 2 years old) staying at Disney's Hotel New York. I have visited both Disneyworld in Orlando and Disneyland in Anaheim in the past so I was keen to see how Disney fared with the European touch.I had read that the extra 'Europeanisation' of the tradional Disney style gives it extra appeal. I have to say I wasn't convinced that all of the changes were for the better. One exception is the 'Discoveryland' area which is a European version of 'Tomorrowland' but instead of the Americana 1950's future utopia theme there is a distinctive Jules Verne theme which is much more classy and enjoyable in my opinion.Most of the attractions are either in both French & English, French with English subtitles or totally in French. I understand that the Park is in France and this has to be and probably should be the case but it definitely detracted from the experience on a number of rides (e.g. Star Tours) and made it impossible to be totally immersed in the experience. I must admit though that this didn't bother my kids at all!The food in the park is very expensive and the counter service food in particular is very low quality. We found the 'eat all you can' buffets the best value for money. We visited in June which is classed as high season however most of the restaurants were either closed completely or didn't open till 12pm or 1pm!! When you have two hungry young children this is a big problem. Picnicing is not technically allowed but we saw plenty of people doing it. Buying snacks at the station shop is by far the cheapest option.Queuing can become a bit of a physical affair as you find yourself constantly having to shift your position to stop people pushing in front of you. Some families even seem to have tactics where by they send their young children up ahead then apologetically push forward to retrieve them but fail to return to the back of the queue. I know this is not unheard of in America but it is a bigger problem in Europe.My biggest gripe however is the organisation. The French staff are no where near as organised as their American counterparts. For example they have a wonderful 'fastpass' system but on many occasions we found it roped off. When I questioned an attendant they said the park was not busy enough to bother with it. I had to disagree when I had to queue with my two young kids for 45 minutes for a ride in the rain!!! Other areas such as security bag checks and park entrance   exit points seem to be ill signed and disorganized.On the whole however we had a wonderful time at Disneyland Paris and although I believe it to be the poor relation to the American parks I would probably visit again. The parade was brilliant and the firework and light show Disney Dream was fantastic. My kids had a wonderful time and at the end of the day that's what it's all about.",Disneyland_Paris
132106615,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,Disappointing as the Park was not too busy and there was a lack of any magical atmosphere. The staff were on the whole 'damp' and it wasn't just the rain! Nothing is updated and some of the major things are being refurbished! I would have thought the shops would have stocked some up to date Disney merchandise. The Studios Park seemed to have more to entertain youngsters.,Disneyland_Paris
132093796,3,2012-5,Philippines,"My family of 4 (2 adults and 2 small children) went to Disneyland Park in Paris last May 13 and 14. We saw the 20th Anniversary lights show before the park closed. It was truly unique and beautiful. As we stayed in the Disney Santa Fe hotel, we went to the park during Extra Magic Hours (EMH). We were able to go to Buzz Lightyear Astroblaster and Orbitron. Unfortunately, Autopia ride opened later, around 12noon.Fastfood was a bit expensive. Food was ok and the price was more reasonable at Casey's Corner and Hyperion Cafe. The kids enjoyed watching old cartoons at the big screen inside the Videopolis while eating the burgers and fries from Hyperion Cafe.People lined up and sat at the curbs of Main Street one hour before the Disney parade started. It was a bit crowded.While watching the parade and 20th Anniversary show, a lot of people were smoking. This is really sad and disturbing. My kids were allergic to cigarette smoke. We did not expect this since this was supposed to be a family oriented park. Wish they had and followed a smoking policy in designated areas only.",Disneyland_Paris
132090542,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Being in the park takes me back to my childhood and watching the excitement in my children is great, even my two year old was in awe (even though some people seemed to think he was too young). The kids were able to go on most rides despite being so young. We took kids to eat with the princesses and even though it was expensive it was worth it for the precious memories.",Disneyland_Paris
132081575,4,2012-6,Germany,Disney's Park and Studio are a great fun. The downside are the waiting times and the food. Terrible fast food.,Disneyland_Paris
132061282,4,2011-7,United States,"It's essentially the same as the Magic Kingdom in Orlando, FL, but the castle is earthen rather than white. A forty five minute ride by subway from Paris, the subway attendants were extremely helpful. Its defintiely worth the trip if you have young children, but it lacks the depth that would cause you to spend several days as in Orlando.",Disneyland_Paris
132058941,2,2012-6,United Kingdom,"I have visited Disney World in Orlando numerous times so this is the experience I am comparing Disneyand Paris to. I am a massive Disney fan and I know the Disney company prides itself on perfection, the best customer service and a magical experience across all of it's parks, well I am sorry to say that Disneyland Paris didn't really have any of these. Basically it doesn't come anywhere close to the Orlando resort and I found that Disneyland Paris definitely does NOT have the Disney magic or atmosphere that it should have. Yeah we had fun, went on most of the rides (admittedly a few are better than Orlando versions), the queues were not as big as Orlando. To cut a long story short:GOOD:  The Disney Dreams show at the castle and the fireworks were out of this world, really amazing! (this was about the only hint of Disney magic that I felt in 2 full days at the parks)  Space Mountain Mission 2 was faster and longer than the Orlando version, as was Thunder Mountain, I guess this is because they are newer and more modern  Indiana Jones rides was good to experience as not been on it before  The Tarzan show was good for watching all of the acrobats but didn't understand the story at all as it was in French (not complaining about the language though as I'm all for when in Rome.... lol)  I know this is in Disney Village but I would recommend the Buffalo Bills Wild West Dinner show as this was a great night, I really really enjoyed this!BAD:  The customer service and attitude from the majority of the Disney staff was absolutely terrible, definitely not the usual happy, smiley, cheerful, helpful Disney staff that I am used to. All very miserable and try to avoid helping you most of the time!  The ride queue times were no where near accurate. Star Tours stated 15 mins so we decided to go on due to the short queue time... 55 mins later we actually got on the ride! The same happened with a few other rides whereby you can't see the actual queue so very difficult to judge how long you will be stuck in it  LOADS of the restaurants in the park were closed in the middle of the day and there was nothing to advise you of this on entry to the park. Wasted a good hour walking around just searching for an eating establishment that was actually open.  The general cleanliness and standard of the park is not up to Disney standard. There isn't any litter but the furniture, benches and props just seem worn, scratched and in need of replacing.   The park is full of very pushy visitors who were just obnoxious, rude and didn't know the meaning of the word queue. Although not directly Disneys fault, there could be a Disney cast member controlling the busy queues (like in Orlando)  Huge lack of characters around the park, not good when children have been waiting so long and got excited about seeing the characters  Most of the toilets were dirty, blocked or out of order. One particular toilet block looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a week! Very smelly... yuck!I could go on and on but I won't bore you anymore lol. In conclusion, we had fun and our trip wasn't a disaster or anything but my heart remains with Disney World Orlando. I really believe that Disneyland Paris need to up their game and paint some smiles on their staffs faces before I will ever return.",Disneyland_Paris
132058518,3,2012-5,United Kingdom,"My children enjoyed it very much, but everything there is so expensive. And I have been in better parks in England. If one decides to go there  it has to be for at least 4 days( we went for two days and I payed 370 euros for three of us!!!), so you can really enjoy it. This way you will have time to get on all rides, you will not get overtired( as us ) and you even may be able to find time to wait in one of the better restaurant in the parks in order to get normal food (not like most of the horrible sandwiches, offered in all fast food places there).",Disneyland_Paris
132049094,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"The 20th anniversary year show if brilliant, although at this time of year it is VERY late at night!

132013162,4,2012-4,United Kingdom,"Probably the cold and wet weather every day did not help, lack of fun probably because there was nothing new or different as this was 3rd time to resort for us.We had escorted my son who has learning difficulties and his new wife on their honeymoon as she had never been to Disney.",Disneyland_Paris
132004793,1,2012-6,United States,"Let me start by saying that I loooove everything Disney. I was first taken to Disneyworld Florida in 1973 at the age of 9. I have been back more than 25 times overs the years, so of course, on my first trip to Paris, I had to see Disneyland Paris. My first clue should have been the 20% discount coupon that I was able to find on a one day 2 park ticket. In my experience, you NEVER find such a coupon for Disneyworld. Sure, they discount the tickets, but never more than a couple of bucks.OK, no problem redeeming the coupon. We went right over to their Disney Studios park because it closed at 6 pm and Disneyland didnt close until 11 pm.I guess this one is meant to be like the MGM Hollywoord studios. At first glance, the park looked like Disney. Nice buildings, flowers, statues. Right past the Studio 1 building, we noticed Minnie Mouse and a line of kids so we went over to take a picture. I've seen other reviews about crowds, people not waiting their turn, and pushy parents. But, how about a pushy Minnie? Yes, Minnie pushed a lady out of the way to take a photo with another child. Now in Minnie's defense, the lady appeared to not wait her turn, but when have you ever seen a character pushing someone? Next, we began to look for shows and rides. Armageddon broken, Aerosmith broken, Lilo and Stitch and Disney Playhouse show in French every 10 20 minutes. In English, every 2 3 hours. Fast Pass machines not in use even though lines warranted it. So, in 4 hours, we got on one ride and just decided to sit in a good spot and wait for the parade. Another disappointment. I know there's a recession, but the parade was over in like 5 minutes. Crazy. I've never seen anything like it.Oh, if you use the bathrooms, bring some toilet paper and a mask because it smells like a NYC subway station in there. Actually, the subway probably smells better.Off to the Disneyland park. Much of the same. No characters around, rides broken including Space Mountain, no fast passes, line times not accurate. If it says 30 minutes, expect 45, etc. Bathrooms just plain nasty. At Disney, this is unheard of. After much frustration and a long day, we just said heck, let's get some ice cream or French fries. We searched for food for about an hour because at 8 pm, all eating establishments off of Main Street were closed or closing despite the park not closing untill 11pm. Notably, all Disney paraphernalia stores and carts were open. We finally made our way to Main Street and found ice creams and waited about an hour and 45 mins for the Disney Dreams show.I feel sorry for Parisiens if they think this is the Disney experience. It was really nothing more than a poorly managed, overpriced attempted replica.***The Disney Dreams show and the Disneyland Parade were excellent.All in all, as I stated, I love Disney so visiting Disneyland Paris was on my bucket list anyway. Can't wait to return to the real Disney though.",Disneyland_Paris

The 11pm display at the disney castle was the highpoint of he hol...I am 36 yrs of age and i had tears pouring down my face...just magical!!!bad points:The ads are misleading there aren't disney characters just walking around basically they turn up with a guard behind them and are then mobbed by the public,I was shocked and disgusted by the behaviour of most of the mums pushing their child in front of others who were waiting and being very rude,grabbing and shouting at the characters i saw several children getting knocked over with no apology and even my 13yr old failed to get even 1 autograph as she was raised with manners unlike most adults there and was patiently waiting for her turn,some sort of roped queue system should be implemented...the shuttle buses at park closing were the same noone queues so as soon as those doors open it's carnage...one night myself and my daughter actually got squeezed out of the bus by a group of grown men and women pushing past us and trapping my 8yr old son inside Panicking I was shouting to let me get my son and that they should be ashamed of themselves....they found this very funny(i didn't!)and this wasn't just the french,italian or spanish with it being uk summer hols it was probably 80% British.every single toilet we used in the park STANK...and i mean drains and stale urine,with overflowing loos and dirty sinks hold your breath! Whilst most 'cast members' were friendly we didn't feel that disney attitude u'd expect. We took bottled water from uk with us each day as drinks lollies so dear 4 euro for a bag of crisps! Almost every building at disney is a shop selling disney merchandise at top prices our kids are old enough to understand value and not spoilt but could see this was problem for others. U will be shattered at the end of it,our kids are older but on the 3rd day we all went back for a nap as it's non stop. 4 days IS enough time it@s not as big as u'd think,maybe 2 3 times the size of Alton Towers.

Rainforest Cafe is a hit with my girls and the Agrabah cafe is ok.If you really want to splash out eat at the Inventions,this is the best.7.if you travel on the eurostar then make use of the disney express service.8.we love the pirates of the carribean ride along with small world,peter pans flight.Most of the rides aren't suitable for under 3year olds.9.All the shops sell the same stuff. whether you buy it at walt studios or disney village but if you are staying at one of the disney hotels, you can have the stuff sent to your hotels shop to collect later rather than dragging it around with you.10.just enjoy yourselves your not going to Florida so don't expect florida.",Disneyland_Paris

The wife changed the youngest outside the toilets as they were too dirty.The Park was ok and the rides if running were good but we all felt the Park was missing the Magic of what I associate with Disney, the Main Street had music and characters in the street but once you leave the main street and start exploring you could be anywhere. In the US you would have lots of music and characters walking around and staff entertaining your kids but this was missing in Paris.I'm glad I went but felt slightly let down but the dirtiness I wont be returning.If you go please be prepared to spend lots as the food was overpriced and poor. 2 cheese burgers and chips and 2 kids meals came to 38 euros !!",Disneyland_Paris

131812877,5,2012-6,Netherlands,"We decided we wanted to visit for the 20th Anniversary because we knew Disney would go big, as always, and they delivered. The Disney Dreams firework show was magical and better than any I've seen so far. We did 2parks 1day because we didn't have so much time in Paris but if you have more than a week it is definitely worth going for two days. Like this you would not have to rush like we did. Their was so much more to see and so little time.",Disneyland_Paris
131809581,2,2012-5,Australia,We went to Disneyland Park Paris because we wanted our children to experience all that Disney magic. Apart from the light show in the evening which was very good there is no magic there! No characters walking around for the kids to get photos with. Most of the fast pass machines weren't working. All round a disappointment,Disneyland_Paris
131808332,5,2012-6,South Africa,"As with my review of the Studio Park, I'm not a child and I have no children, but we spent the day at Disneyland (a day is not enough, BTW, we barely saw and did a fraction of what there is) and it was so much fun. Great day out, highly recommended. At first look the entry fees seem extreme but for what you are getting it actually isn't.",Disneyland_Paris
131764824,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"the park is alot bigger than it looks and every land is so different from the others it feels like you're in a different place.definitely keep a map though as its easy to get lost.the meet and greets are good but you wait a long time which is expected, try and arrive around 15 30 mins before it starts to ensure you're one of the first.there are vast amounts of gift shops and cafes to choose from and nearly all the staff spoke at least a little english.they were very friendly and polite.the place was really clean.ther parade was magical, ensure you get a spot early though and dont let people push in front of you, you'd be suprised how many adults were diong this, not the children! the anniversary train was nice, the characters got off the train for autographs and then carried in the journey again.the 11pm show was fantastic, very clever lazer water firework show which everytime we saw it we noticed something we'd missed the time before.the queues for the rides were really long but that was expected.it's like being in a fairytale land in the park and it was worth every penny to see the childrens faces light up when they saw the charaters and parades.highly recommended place to visit",Disneyland_Paris
131748623,5,2012-3,Isle of Man,"I have been to Disneyland Paris around 7 times now, and am due to return this summer. My last trip was march 2012, and before writing anymore I just want to point a couple of things out.The bad reviews on here are shocking, and honestly not a fair representation of the park at all. Before you go there are a couple of things you should realise, the park is in France, a European country. Is it so wrong that they should speak half of everything in French? No! They actually speak everything half French and half English. They cater for mainly Europeans, because the park is in Europe. I have been on rides, like the Pirates of the Caribbean for example, where the whole ride has been in English, other times in French. People expect everything to be in English, but really why should it be. In my opinion, seeing the signs for the rides in French has always added to the magic for me, and is something that makes the park different from the others. Not something I would complain about. The park is not a copy of anything else.My second point is the fact, this is NOT Florida. It is Disneyland Paris. A completely different, unique park, with its own magic. The castle in Paris, is completely unique to any in the world. People need to stop comparing the two. Go here with an open mind if you are Florida fanatic as it is different. Not in a bad way by any means, but a different experience. My third point is that I have read reviews, stating that the park has incredibly long queue lines. Complaining over queuing? You are in Disneyland Paris!!! If you go at peak times, it is to be expected. This isn't a hidden a fact. Make the most of Fast Passes, go to the rides during the parade one day, get there early. There are MANY ways round this. The key is to plan your day.My fourth point is about the fact people have been saying this park can be completed in a day? Are you kidding? A day here will not even give you a good enough taste for how amazing this park is. Let alone the fact, Walt Disney Studios is just round the corner! The park is not as small as people make it out to be. The lands are uniquely themed, and are different from the other parks in the world. You need tallest two full days to really get the best experience here. There are many attractions to go on. Some may look just like kids rides, but go on them, go on them all! My fifth point is in regards to the food at Disneyland Paris. For starters, when comparing this to America, the food most likely is better in America overall. Most of the restaurants in Disneyland Paris do tend to be Fast Food, burgers, chips, hot dogs etc. With this being said, the food isn't horrible. It is good food. It may be expensive, but that is the Euro for you. If you are after more of a meal, then there are plenty of good restaurants in and around the park, but do be prepared that they may be expensive. At the end of the day, you are at Disneyland. Expect to pay a little extra. My biggest tip is, bring your own food. If you are concerned about the price of food, it is key that you bring packed lunch. Stock up from your hotel on breakfast. There are ways round factors like where to eat. It angers me, that people write reviews complaining how food, and queuing, and it not being like Florida have ruined their whole trip. It feels like they've come wanting it not to be as good, and are looking for reasons to criticize this wonderful park. The park has always been expensive with food, depending on the time of year there have been long queues, it may not be like Florida, there may not be dozens of massive rollercoasters, but all the rides and attractions here are first class; some significantly better than Florida, like Pirates of the Caribbean.People need to stop complaining over things that are to be expected. If you go peak season, it will be busy. But you get more entertainment. There will be stuff in French, but you're in France, so why wouldn't there be? There will be queues for rides. The park will most likely be busy. But you are in a theme park. What are you expecting? This place is truly magical. The magic is there everytime I visit. The rides only seem to get better with every go. Disneyland Paris are improving month by month. The latest Disney dreams gives real credit to the efforts of the Imagineers improving Disneyland Paris. People need to stop cristising the park without fair or justifiable means. I would highly recommend visiting here. It will be a trip you never forget; a magical one at that!",Disneyland_Paris
131746892,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Hugely busy, massive queues   don't go on a weekend. The rides are great but everything was a minimum of 60 mins to wait so it makes for a lot of standing around.The park food is overpriced and not very good   if you are vegetarian it is a case of chips or a 3 cheese salad that isn't even as good as the ones you can get in McDonalds and that is saying something.Would go back but at a real off peak time.",Disneyland_Paris

131732678,1,2011-11,United Kingdom,"Visited several months ago but decided to write this review as some friends have just returned from this money grabbing hell hole and have related the same experiences that we met. Basically the French should never have been allowed to get their hands on a Disney franchise because a) they don't like foreigners and as tourists tend to be foreigners they make up the majority of visitors here and thus obviously annoys the staff! b) this Disney park is aimed at the French first, then other Europeans (Germans, Dutch...) c) if you are British you get treated with utter disdain. Try explaining to your six year old child why Goofy pushed him out of the way so the French child could take priority for the photograph   try being a mum and wanting to smack Goofy in front of everyone!!!Basically the operators of this park have not got a handle on how to create a Disney experience complete with smiles, laughter and 'feel good' atmosphere. You resent paying 200 euros for your family to get in to be snarled at, shrugged at and pushed and jostled roughly in the queue you have stood in for over an hour by other people of local nationality. Men are the worst, this is a habit I also discovered exists in a couple of theme parks in Spain. I don't mind queing for whatever time it takes to get on a ride but I get real angry when my children have been patient, stood in line, only to have four loud local teenage girls come from under the barrier and stand in front of them. The attendants say nothing and the pusher ins just give you the 'go back where you came from' glare...Food   overpriced junk. Toilets   filthy, take your own toilet paper if you   like most people   tend to use it...Health and Safety   it is the French habit to smoke everywhere so be prepared to endure the stink   mind your young children's eyes and cigarettes are held down at their eye level...as mentioned in several reviews here...dangerous!!!!Queuing   stand your ground over your place in the queue   you WILL get pushed in front of!Language   speak French...? so do we   but the staff like to pretend you cannot.For these reasons alone I would like to see Paris Disney closed down   or old Walt come back and haunt the hell out of the place! awful awful, awful...and I am sure the attitude of staff would earn them the 'R' label here in the UK.",Disneyland_Paris
131732551,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"After several years of moaning how can older people be so bothered about a Disney park, I don't why I did so. After visiting this park with my girlfriend and her family for her 18th I can see why. Its absolutely magical and made me feel like a big kid!With stopping in a Disney hotel we got park entry for a good price and had free parking at the park (didn't make use of as the walk is very short) and early entry (didn't make use of as we stopped up for the fireworks every night).It was the 20 year anniversary this year and the special parade and firework show were fantastic. The parade is definitely worth seeing and a front row seat makes it extra special   due to popularity people start queuing at 5! The parade starts at 7! Also the firework show was very moving and magical. The projection onto the castle was mesmerising.Highlights for me ride wise was the Buzz Lightyear ride (get a Fastpass), Thunder Mountain (need a Fastpass again), Indiana Jones and Space Mountain. The park is great for all ages, something for everyone.Food, drink and gifts (as with all theme parks) are extremely overpriced. We paid    6.90 for a beer and    30 for 5 cakes and 5 small drinks served it paper cups. Extortion at its greatest.Nevertheless this is a brilliant place and I can't wait to visit again! Already planning a trip to Disneyworld Florida!",Disneyland_Paris

Why would anyone queue over an hour for Dumbo ride? Got fast pass tickets for some rides which reduced queuing time. Parade wad really good and firework show was amazing. Not as many characters as last time walking around the park which is a shame . Merchandise overpriced as per usual . I stopped looking at the price of things after the first day as you have to expect to be ripped off. Constant bag checks at entrance annoying..... Looking for contraband picnics I suppose.

131726445,5,2012-6,Canada,Until we visited Disneyland my children (5 and 3) did not know who Mickey Mouse was. Now they do. We had a great time over 3 days between both parks and went on lots of rides and attended a few shows. It's a small world was their favourite (along with Buzz Lightyear a close second). Definitley a kids wonderland.,Disneyland_Paris
131724468,1,2012-6,United Kingdom,"If you enjoy queing, pushing your way through crowds and stinking toilets this is the place for you. My complaints are endless but heres a few. The park cant cope with the amount of people. You queue for 20 mins to get in then another 15 to have your bags xrayed. You then queue again for at least 15 20 mins for them to check your tickets. Then you queue again to book your lunch time late meal another 15 20 mins when you later go for your meal you queue again regardless of your reservation as no one sticks to the times reserved. My first meal mussels on rice and even that was a shock as it had a large black stone in it the size of a mussel, the waitress just said oh im sure it proves it was from the sea i will tell the supervisor and just walked off. In this resturant serving approx 100 people there is 1 toilet and 1 sink in the ladies and gents it stinks in there and the floor is sticky underfoot. In another toilet in disney studios park as my son and i walked in his feet went from underneath him and he hit the floor hard as the floor was covered in water from the overflowing blocked toilets he is 7 and doesnt like disney anymore. 4 major rides were closed the 5 days we were there even the top section of the castle. If you go with young children with pushchair etc check your hotel has a lift some dont. The park stays open late after the public have gone but you can forget the rides your young children couldnt get on in the day as they close them, Nice touch. The layout of the park is good the parade and the 20th anniversary show but overall the experience is stressfull and not one i would recomend, there was no magic for us as it was ruined by a park that is obviously cannot cope.ps.breakfast is a free for all ive never heard so many plates being dropped people complaining and staff running around like idiots trying to keep up, nightmare.",Disneyland_Paris
131721151,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"Fantastic! Only a couple of gripes, first was the pushing and shoving every time a Disney character appeared, mainly by parents trying to push their children to the front to get an autograph or a photo. The other was the queues to see a Disney Princess, we waited two and a half hours for two minutes with Princess Tiana (my daughter thought it was totally worth it). You did get to see them in the parade each evening but the only other opportunity to actually meet a Disney Princess was to have lunch or dinner in a specific restaurant but we decided not to at 160 euros for three of us. I think they could have done more to have the Disney Princesses more accessible as it is what most little girls go there to see. The other Disney characters are much more readily available to meet.",Disneyland_Paris
131700664,4,2012-6,Ireland,"We visited Disneyland Paris June 2012, staying in the Sequoia Lodge hotel. I had read several reviews before travelling saying that the park was rundown and in need of a facelift but I have to say it was wonderful and very well maintained. The grounds and the attractions were first class and it really is a magical experience,even for the adults!! The downside to it is the walking, bring a good pair of shoes and the queues are crazy too,be prepared to wait for EVERYTHING :( Our hotel room wasn't great,it was very cramped for 5 people and the breakfast isn't much better, I would advise to bring as much food as you can with you. The prices are also crazy. Parks are brilliant but the Hotel and the food is poor.",Disneyland_Paris
131689321,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"DLP has something for everyone, The fastpass is absolutely brilliant and works so well. I went with my husband, our 12 year old son and 3 year old daughter. We all enjoyed it. We took turns on the rides and we were lucky that our 3 year old was very patient when it came to queueing. The best rides are the Crash Coaster  be prepared for about an hour long waiting time  the minimum hight is 1.07 but i think it is not suitable for children under 7 8 as it is an absolutely wild ride in the dark with lots of huge dips and climbs. The Space Mission2 is fantastic  we didnt have to queue at all for this ride, and we made the most of Thunder Mountain Fast pass. Our 3 your old wasnt a big fan of rides before coming to DLP, I was worried she really wouldnt give anything a go but DLP changed it all for her. She went on Its a small small world and she loved it. Teacups was another favourite of hers. Both these rides appear to have long queues but dont let this put you off because they really do move very quickly. We waited for each of these rides max 10 minutes. Food and drink is quite expensive but we only ate at McDonalds at Disney village which was good value for money and we brought our own sandwiches and drinks for the rest of the time. saves moeny and most importandly time because we just ate them on the go. There were plenty of arears where you could just sit down and have a picnic. Three is a little supermarket just outside the Disneyland parks that offers a good selection of drinks, snacks, sanwiches so get them from there rather than buying food from the park. We paid about 24 euros for croissants for breakfast, sandwiches for lunch, drinks, crips and biscuits  so 2 meals for 4 people sorted. The whole atmosphere at the parks is very special, nice happy lovely music playing, the characters wondering around, it makes you smile even on a rainy day.We went to watch the 20th Anniversary Disney Dreams show and I must say that was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. It made the whole trip so magical. The only thing I found disappointing was that the Star Tours ride was broken down. The key to having a fab time is to plan ahead and be organised. 2 days that we had certainly wasnt enough to see everything but we went on all the rides we intended to go on, got to see Mickey and the Disney Dreams show. Now we just have to go back when the youngest one is old enough for the big rides.",Disneyland_Paris

131668155,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,I have just returned from Euro Disney. This is the first time that I have been to Euro in 20 years. I went with my wife and 2 kids girl 2 and boy 7. We had an excellent time with the kids loving the rides and having a great time. First the plus points Cafe Mickey seeing the characters this was excellent where you got a piece of paper asking you not to let your children run after the characters which all the children obeyed. The staff were very friendly maybe I got lucky after reading other peoples reviews. The rides were great for kids but if you are looking for thrill rides then maybe not enough but hey this is DISNEY for children..The negatives TOILETS were firstly not sign posted after being nearly sick because of the smell. I could not believe how bad they were this must be looked at.. The ques for my little girl to see a princess was massive we must have qued for about 2 1 2 hours.. Can not see why they open this at the weekend at 10 but not til 1pm during the week.. Saying that she loved it when we did see her.My overall opinion was that while their are 1 or 2 problems it was a great few days and my little boy wants to see how Disney does Xmas.. At the end of the day you know you are going to pay because it is Disney. But I would go back.,Disneyland_Paris

131650346,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We arrived at the park each day just before 9.30am, which is when they open the gates for you to get in.We then headed for Frontierland, which is where thunder Mountain is located.Although you do then have to queue outside the lands until they open the gates at 10.00am.Then my husband and 2 kids, along with others made a friendly and good spirited dash to Thunder Mountain, where they got straight on the ride. The kids then wanted to do this again one of the days, so we got the Fast pass, which worked well and was only a 15 minute wait. They rode this 4 times in total and loved it!The rest of the park was very well done and had a lovely frinedly atmosphere.The queues weren`t as bad as we thought and Space Mountain was only about 5 10 minutes!We didn`t see the main parades as we left the park each day around 3 as the kids were tired, but we did see Mickey and Minnie and even got Minnie`s autograph.We only ate luch in the park on the last day, which was about 24 euros for 2 pizzas and a slice of garlic bread.we took our own food each day, which was a much cheaoer way of doing it.We loved this park and i much prefered it to the Studios.The kids had a great time and loved every minute of it.will definately be going back.",Disneyland_Paris
131644348,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We are lucky enough to have visited Florida many times, so we really know the parks well. I was scepticial about this place, but was surprised how good it was.On our first day we didnt get in the park till around three, and I thought it was closed as it was so quiet!Walked straight onto space mountain, no way you could do that in Florida, and its a better one to.Other good rides are the mine train and buzz light year (kids ride).The real highlight of the day and what makes it feel like Disney comes right at the end of the day with the Fab 20th lights and firework show, this really is Disney at its best and dont think I have seen better on any of my visits to their other parks. Yes you will stand in line for a lot of the things like snow white, peter pan but if youve not done them with young kids its worth the wait.",Disneyland_Paris
131609356,4,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We took two children, 5 and 2, who absolutely loved it. Being Half Term, the place was very busy and the queues were daunting, many lasting up to an hour, especially to meet the princesses. More for the girls than boys in this park   princesses to be seen everywhere. Not much space for boisterous play and no open playground. All geared to rides and films.There is a good system for booking  fast track  tickets, allowing you to come back later and skip most of the queue, on some of the busier rides. It was very clean, the food wasn't brilliant, the ladies' facilities really the bugbear. Having small children in tow does mean that the latter need greater attention than they currently receive. The mens' facilities were so much better, husband reports, spotless. The piped music didn't thrill. The parade at 7pm did. The rides did, too, and the staff were always nice, though some didn't know how to direct visitors to other parts of the park. There really isn't enough for older children (over 10) for more than a day, or for children over 5 for more than three days. The catering is varied and can be booked from any of the restaurants on site   booking essential   or by phone. We went there for the children's amusement, not our own, and in that respect, it was a definite success. My very best memory   being driven in pouring rain in an old 50's petrol engined banger round a seriously long 10 minute well landscaped track by a two year Princess yelling  Fun! fun!    I was only allowed to hit the accelerator but not to touch the wheel. Clever central barrier stops the car hitting anything. Her sister's favourite moment was on the Peter Pan ride, flying out through the bedroom windows. Magic.",Disneyland_Paris

After visiting Disneyworld in Florida 12 times I was apprehensive that this would be a let down. How wrong I was. My daughters were transfixed by the place. Yes its a little expensive, but the so are the UK theme parks and when Disney does something, it does it brilliantly. You can see where your money goes here. The park stayed open until 11pm which was fantastic. We will be going back. Stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne. Also excellent.",Disneyland_Paris
131572267,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"We visited the Disneyland Paris park earlier this week and were surprised to find it quite empty. The weather was horrible that day (cold and wet) so maybe that was a factor although people who had made the trip specifically to visit Disney would have had little choice. Food and drinks in the park are really expensive (Euro 2.50 for a tiny coffee out of a machine   and when I say tiny I mean one of those really small plastic cups that come out of a coffee dispenser). Due to the inclement weather we only went on indoor rides attractions. The Space Mountain is still a good thrill and we enjoyed it. Having done the indoor rides and fed up of the rain, we strolled over to the Disneyland Studios next door and did the Hollywood Towers of Terror ride, the Aerosmith rollercoaster and the Armageddon special effects attraction. We didn't have to wait for more than 15 minutes at any of the rides due to low attendance. We had visited Disneyland Paris around 16 years ago and it seemed more magical to us at the time. Since then we have visited the Disney World in Florida and the Disneyland in Anaheim, California and the Paris park seems really small in comparison now and seems to lack the magic feel. Luckily we hadn't paid for the park tickets (having got complimentary tickets through a Sky promotion) otherwise we wouldn't have been too happy to fork out the adult admission price of Euro 74 per person payable at the park entrance. Whilst most staff in the park made an effort to appear friendly and cheerful, we also noted that some employees in the park shops restaurants lacked enthusiasm and could barely disguise their boredom. I also noted that smoking seemed to be allowed anywhere in the park (outdoors) and was not restricted to the designated smoking areas like the parks in America. Not sure if this is just due to a more relaxed attitude to smoking in France or whether they just turn a blind eye in the park so as not to alienate visitors who smoke (I mean better to have a paying smoker visitor than no visitor, right?). We left after 3 hours of walking around in the rain and made our way to the Valle d'Europe Mall which is only a 10 minute drive away. I don't think we will be visiting this park again any time soon and having heard of the financial difficulties they are having, I can see how this park may struggle to remain open (and make a profit) in the forseeable future. Only time can tell if this park can reverse its fortunes and bring the magic back.",Disneyland_Paris

131529860,5,2012-6,United Kingdom,"This was our very first Disneyland experience and we weren't disappointed! Loved that the park grounds were clean and well maintained, the queueing systems were efficient and well organised (never waited longer than 30 minutes for anything). Used the Fastpass system on one ride which worked well (TIP: your Fastpass is actually still valid for a couple of hours after your alloted time if you happen to miss it). My children loved Buzz Lightyears Laser Blaster, Small World and the Star Tours simulator, we didn't do the bigger roller coaster type rides due to the ages of the children so can't comment on those. The parade was fantastic (worth getting a good viewing spot up to an hour beforehand) and despite a rather long and chilly wait for the Disney Dreams show at closing time one night...boy, was it worth the wait!!! The show was spectacular, technologically brilliant and just magical! Ok, some tips: consider hiring a stroller if you have a younger child, my daughter is 6 and it was the best E8.95 I spent, especially for the evenings, for a returnable deposit (which is just a print of your credit card), you can also take the stroller off site to your hotel   you will need to produce the paperwork at the gate. Try to find a bench to wait for parade show or go prepared with blankets cushions jumpers to sit on   it's not much fun for the kids standing or sitting on the pavement! Be prepared to be a little jostled, the character meet & greets can be busy, I didn't build my childrens hopes up by saying they would get to meet any of them but I was surprised at how many they did meet, the autograph books are a great souvenir for them and have spaces to put your photos when you get home. Most people were polite and patient and I only experienced one rather rude mother who practically wrestled poor Pluto to the ground insisting he sign her daughters book! The days can be long and tiring, good walking shoes are essential   it's a good idea to go back to your (resort) hotel for a break and come back in the evening to see a bit more. We all thoroughly enjoyed our Disneyland experience and will definitely visit again!!",Disneyland_Paris

131489693,4,2012-6,Ireland,"This was my second time attending, the last one being about 10 years ago. Have to say I had sad memories of queuing in the rain with a 3 year old for Dumbo the elephant ride that lasted 2 mins and this time I got a real sense of deja vue as I was there with a 5 year old and it wasnt much better. The best advice I could give is to try and get tickets online before you go, we managed to save around 60 euro on them by booking in advance.Its heartbreaking to watch your kids want to buy merchandise that as my child said,  even if it was half the price it would still be too much. . The food is quite basic and you have to wait a long time so just be smart and bring a nice lunch with lots of snacks and drinks, you will be glad you did.No matter how nice the weather bring a raincoat as it seemed to change every hour from sunshine to rain. Wear really comfortable shoes and don't be fashion conscious.Last but not least. GET THE FAST PASS. I always thought this cost extra but it doesn't , just go to the rides and look out for the time that they issue tickets for that ride. Check that your child is over 1 metre 32 and if they are the experience is a better one.

The only downside about the park is that the food and drink is very expensive. It is 3 euros for a bottle of coke, or 30 40 euros each in a buffet restaurant! If you need to get food or drink to take to the parks, I suggest you visit the Val D'Europe complex, which is free by shuttle outside the parks, or one stop on the RER. They have a gigantic hypermarket called  Auchan , which sells snacks drinks significantly less than Disney does. Also, the park is very accessible. You can get here by Eurostar, Autoroute (via Eurotunnel), Train, RER, Shuttle from CDG Airport etc. In conclusion, Disneyland Park is a truly magical place for families and ideal for some couples or disney lovers.",Disneyland_Paris

131436083,2,2012-6,United Kingdom,"This was our thrid trip (and most definitely final) trip to Disneyland Paris. Whereas previous trips have been spoiled by aggresive french pushing past to get to the front of the queue this was not the case this time. Rather the problems were that a lot of the attractions were closed and why does no one stop the locals from smoking in the queue, despite asking for them to put cigarettes out we were ignored! I complained to staff and was met with a shrug of the shoulders. WDW has rules and etiquette, which is there to make the trip comfortable for all. Disneyland Paris does not seem to have the same consideration. We had dinner in the Blue Lagoon Restaurant, really lovely food VERY EXPENSIVE and the service was slow but the food more than made up for it. The rides that were open were good, my favourite is the Tower of Terrors.",Disneyland_Paris

131381622,4,2012-3,United States,"My family are big Disney fans and my daughter (18) and I couldn't pass up the opportunity to visit Disneyland Paris while in France. We found ourselves doing a lot of comparing between the Paris park and U.S. parks. We loved the entryway coming into Disneyland Paris   it was familiar, yet different and special. We enjoyed the less crowded   shorter line atmosphere (we were fortunate to visit on a weekday while school was still in session). While we found that we prefer some U.S. versions of rides (such as Indiana Jones), we also prefer some France versions (such as Thunder Mountain Railroad) and we have new favorites that are unique to France (we LOVED Alice's Curious Labyrinth). I do agree with several of the other comments that I've seen posted, that there is an opportunity for improvements in general trash pick up in some areas and cleanliness fragrance of the toilets   I was a bit surprised that this was an issue when I think of the Disney brand.That aside, we enjoyed our day and it was well worth the visit.A couple of logistical notes:For those of you considering a side trip from Paris, we found it very easy to navigate the metro train system to make our way to Disneyland Paris. And Disneyland Paris, Walt Disney Studios and the Disney Village are all conveniently located near each other ... just a few minutes walk and you can travel from one to the other.For those of you considering purchasing your tickets online in advance, we did this and printed our tickets at home and presented them at the entrance   very easy no issues. Do note that the paper ticket you've printed is your ticket for the day   if you are using the Fast Pass machines, the Fast Pass machines have a scanner that scans the barcode on your home printed ticket.",Disneyland_Paris

131333892,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"I recently went to both parks with my all adult family. We had not been to the Paris park for 14 years and it didnt look as though anything had been done in the intervening years! On the positive side it is Disney, and we had a great time all together. But there are lots of things to complain about. Firstly, for the amount it costs, both the entrance and then everything else thereafter. the food everywhere inside is horrendously expensive, quite revolting and served by staff who really look as though they really want to be somewhere else. On the staff, not all of them were bad, but they could do with some customer service training, and it would be nice if they smiled, and there were a few more of them. The park itself needs some care. The grounds look unkempt with loads of weeds and untrimmed shrubs and bushes.The rides have flaking paintwork, and parts of them were broken, and cynically the only buildings that look as though they have been treated are the shops.Lastly, the grounds and restaurants all had lots of rubbish around, with a few staff trying valiantly to keep it at bay. It was not very busy, and i can only imagine how awful it is in high season. As for The Disney village it was foul. Smelly,Dirty and expensive, and again needs more staff in the bars and restaurants. We waited ages for mediocre food in both Rainforest cafe and Planet Hollywood, and there was 1 barman serving. I know this is one long whinge, but we have been to Florida and California Disney, and the difference in them and France is vast. I would really save and go to America",Disneyland_Paris

131289304,3,2012-5,United Kingdom,"This is was our fourth visit to Disneyland Paris, we went with our 7 year old daughter and 5 and 4 year old sons. It was also our 1st visit since we travelled to Disney florida 2 years ago. Perhaps it's unfair to compare the two directly and I will start with the positives.It's a lot closerIt's convenient for a short break from the ukThe brand new toy story area in the studio park is goodEr that's about it.My main issue is that the management team at Disney Paris have decided to both cut costs and maintain or increase prices, you don't have to be a genius (and I'm not) to work out that this will directly affect the quality of service and the experience on offer.Their main problem is staffing, in previous years the staff have been generally pretty good, now their numbers appear to have been cut and their morale is poor, many of them have decided to express their dissatisfaction by being rude and or unhelpful. Several times I was pushed past by Disney staff without a word, or ignored when asking for help, I couldn't help but compare this to Florida where the staff were uniformly excellent.Small problems became obvious when you looked, the public toilets were almost all filthy, the general areas were kept tidy but the flower beds were full of weeds, all of these imperfections are unthinkable in Florida. Perhaps it was bad luck but many of the rides were continuously going out of service. And many of the attractions are now 20 years old and look worn. It's all a real shame as I've always previously enjoyed Disney Paris and I now feel that this will be my last visit until I hear some continuous positive feedback on this site about how things have improved.To finish on a positive note we stayed at the Davy Crockett ranch and it was absolutely fine. If you do get a premium plus cabin like we did, please note that they only have Ethernet connections and no wireless Internet so you can't connect unless you have a Ethernet equipped device. And there is no wireless anywhere in the parks that I could find so sort your 3G data allowance before you go.",Disneyland_Paris
131286454,3,2012-6,United Kingdom,"The park itself was fun and we had a great time with the kids. The organistaion was pretty patchy across the park with apathetic staff..The restaurants were all terrrible! Disney seems to have combined the worst of French service with the worst of American Fast food! Worth picking up some French bread and cheeses and taking it in for a Pic Nic. Prices in the restaurants are really steep circa 80 Euros for a buffet lunch for two adults and two children. We also struggled to find pasta for our kids but could only get hot dogs, nuggets etc..Hotel New York was pretty decent..Personally I think Legoland in windsor does a better jon on a much smaller scale..Kids are very happy so makes the high cost just about worthwhile..",Disneyland_Paris

131177631,4,2012-5,United Kingdom,"The 'theme' in general is good, but as I get older I notice the commercial side to a place like Disneyland more and more.The best bit, has to be the fireworks and lights show at 11pm, one massive tip. If you want to see it all, get to the castle at around 10.15pm and sit (on the floor) as close to the middle as possible! This is the only thing that seemed new and upto date for me.This place isn't cheap for food, we paid around   23 for 2 meals (Cheese burger, chips, drinks, magnum) Queing times varied from 5 25 minutes depending on the attraction, the most popular when we were there, Peter Pan & The Buzzlightyear (Thrill seekers out there maybe disappointed) the rides are tame to say the least.My partner did think she was going to see characters walking around the place all of the time, if you DO see any, you just happen to be in the right place at the right time.The parade, starts at 7pm again get there early, sit on the kerb.All in all... Great for children!",Disneyland_Paris
131170197,3,2012-5,Switzerland,"This was the second time I visited Disneyland Paris, but it was the first time with my young daughter. Attractions are good but there are quite a few a issues that I consider unacceptable for the Disney park:  Even if people should smoke just in the dedicated areas, people are smoking everywhere in the park and it looks like nobody is interested in enforcing such rule. I have a 3 yo child with me and I am very disappointed about the fact that we have the smoke in our face so often.  Food and beverages are expensive. I could expect this. But the quality is very very poor. If you go in a fast food for lunch you cannot spend less than 15 euro per person and what you get is barely edible.  All toilets around the park are stincky.I was in Disneworld Orland last year and it was definetely better than the park in Paris.",Disneyland_Paris

We were lucky we were there at a quiet time with hardly no queues but if you are going during busy times I would recommend that you plan your days and plan how you will use your fastpass as it must be a nightmare if you are waiting for rides for hours. We food is very overpriced (49 euros for 5 hotdos, 2 chips 2 drinks!!) and very rubbish so exppect the worst and you won't be disappointed.A fun park, clean and safe surroundings and great rides for all the family.

131038426,3,2012-5,United States,"If you have young children, get to the park at 10 and go straight to the back of the park to fantasy land where the kids rides are, that way you will get to go on lots of rides before the crowds move in. Buy food to take in with you as little bit dear and limited choice of chips and nuggets etc. Everyone gets free Fast pass on their tickets so use it!!! Selected rides only but i sent hubby off to pop the tickets in the machine for the rides. You can only use one fast pass at a time, but it gives you an allocated time for that ride with 30 minute slot to save queuing. That way you can be get off one ride and go straight to another. Buzz lightyear is great the kids loved that ride, but very busy so Fast pass it!! Thunder mountain is manic busy so again fast pass it. Kids loved disney very magical, if you want to see the characters, go into Disney studios and see them there as less queuing only bout 20 mins as opposed to over an hour.

131019208,5,2012-5,Ireland,"Just back from a second family trip for 4 days to Disneyland Paris with family (aged 6,4 and 2). Was previously there in Feb 2010.Some useful tips if you are considering it (which believe you should!)1. My kids loved it   the first time I was dragged to it, but when you see the expression and joy they get it is infectious. If your kids are in any way into Disney, they should love it. You will need at least 2 full days plus hopefully another 1 or 2 on the days you travel (i.e. 3 days in total). Unless you are a rollcoaster junkie, more than 4 days could be too much.2. Once your kid is over 2 and certainly by aged 3, there is plenty for them to do   Fantasyland and the Adventure Island are very cool. Also, the park is huge and the rides are open from early morning until 10pm at night (in summer)   after which there is a pretty impressive fireworks display at night (i.e. you can start at 11am and they will be shattered when you leave).3. While the Disneyland Hotel is the best and sits at the entrance gate, they are all c. 3 star hotels (i.e. this is not the 4 Seasons   Marriott)   very clean (as everything in Disney is), well maintained, but aging decor (styling is showing its age) and ok facilities. Therefore, you don't need to stay on the Disneyland Hotel (very expensive) to enjoy it. The walk from the New York Hotel (much cheaper) to the front gate is almost exactly 10 mins.4. The food in the park and in most of the hotels is pretty average and quite expensive (in some cases very much so). At least the Village   well worth going to   has better food with a proper Starbucks and McDonalds plus the Rainforest Cafe is very novel for young kids. It is a bit of a drawback that there is not more well known 'franchised dining' in the park itself.5. Disneyland is an outdoor experience and a pretty physical one   i.e there is plenty of walking. You need to dress (you and kids) appropriately   i.e. runners, fleeces, layers etc. If the weather is dodgy with chance of rain, you will need to bring your own big golf umbrella (the park sells smaller ones for 40 euros!). If the weather is good make sure you bring hats etc. fror the kids (it can get very hot and they are out all day).6. Following on from 5, we brought the buggy both times and were very glad of it although you can rent them there. There is no problem leaving the buggies etc. outside of the rides as you and the family jump on.7. Definately get a Fastpass if possible   there are plently of things that have moderate queues (i.e. c. 10 mins)   and given the park is open from 8am to 10pm, you will welcome the breaks. However on the popular things   Peter Pan ride or the Rollercoasters etc., the Fastpass is very handy. You just swipe your ticket through a seperate terminal which is usually at the start of the queue   it will issue you with a Fastpass ticket for c. 30min to 1 hour later   at which time you can then jump the queue. The only drawback is that you cannot get a second Fastpass ticket until you have used that one (i.e. you can't go to all the best rides and load up with Fastpasses.)8. The big things that I noticed which had changed since my 2010 vist were:(a) 10.30pm Fireworks Display is very impressive(b) The 7pm Charachters Parade seemed much smaller(c) The Princesses are now housed in their own house (were previously outside) Minuses   the Princesses are",Disneyland_Paris

130965972,4,2012-5,United States,"I last visited Disneyland Paris around 15 years ago when I was in my early 20's and went back last week for as part of my birthday in Paris to find very little had changed. I was a little bit surprised to arrive at Marnee le Vallee RER station to find armed soldiers patrolling the station, I'm told this isn't unusual as MLV is a stop for the Eurostar so they have keep an eye on those entering France at MLV but for those younger ones in your group it can be a little unnerving. The RER station is smack bang in front of the main gates and takes just a few minutes to walk across and into Disney. It is a special feeling when you walk into Disney for the first time so make the most of it. I like that the park is clean and tidy and you can walk from one to the other in 15 minutes, it's actually rather small so quite deceptive. I LOVED meeting Mickey Mouse, we queued for around 40 minutes but whilst you queue you can watch old MM cartoons which I just loved, and so did the children in the queue. There is a photographer to take your photo but she was happy to take photos using our own cameras which I thought was quite nice. The parades are colourful and well worth taking time out to watch. What I didn't like was the constant music, there isn't a place in the park where you can just chill and relax as they pump through Disney music all day so after a while it can all get a little too much. Now as a girl who likes to shop the shop's were very disappointing, each one is stocked with exactly the same items with hardly any variations. Don't expect to buy things for other Disney stories or characters it really is all about Mickey and Minnie so for a girl who loves Tigger it was disappointing to find just one pair of Tigger ears with hardly anything else to buy. Disney really are missing a trick here and should consider extending their range. They also ask that you don't picnic in the park and as such areas to sit and eat something you've brought in really do not exist which I felt is a shame as if you have younger children in your group you may want to take some time out for them, and you, to have a break.",Disneyland_Paris

130661880,1,2012-5,United States,"Went to Disney with very high expectations and it turned out to be one of our worst experiences ever.To start off just to buy the tickets it took us around close to one and a half hours.Later we saw that they had ticket counters near Disney Village and Walt Disney Studios park with absolutely no lines.They could have directed us to go to these other counters but oh! well we are in Paris no! so we had to get a taste of the rudeness.The wait time and lines to see each character was at least 60 minutes. They have a fast pass option but there was no one to tell us how to get the fast pass.When we found one that explained that we were already eligible for one,the people near the characters said they were done with fast pass for the day and wouldn't give no more.A little heads up at the ticketing counter would have taken care of this.We wanted to get on the train ride,the ushers there said that the train was not working & when we asked could they tell us when it would be functional they said they had no clue.Two hours later when we went back and asked them,they said the train rides for the day was done & it was just 4:45p:m and the train rides were supposed to end at 6p:m.They were endless queues everywhere.They totally suck at crowd management. Didn't think that Disney is so dysfunctional.All in all a terrible experience.Wasn't magical at all for my little boy who was crying when they said there were no train rides.Who cried again at not being able to meet the characters he really wanted to meet.Just wasted a lot of money and I will think a hundred times before I set foot on another Disney property.Seems like Disney is super confident that no matter what people will still go.But I am making sure that I will keep my family & friends away from this property.",Disneyland_Paris

I was really expecting more european stuff and not go into new orleans or the wild west.

We had been to the Florida parks several times and thought this would be the same or nearly as. Unfortunately, it lacked the magic of the Florida park although some of the rides were better. In Florida you have characters at points throughout, here there were none that we saw. The food was expensive but then you are in Europe so have to expect it. They advertised 20 years of opening but did not seem to have anything special going on. I am sure we have been spoilt by going to Florida first and Europe second.

130576938,5,2012-5,United States,"The last time we went to Disneyland was 5 years ago with our (then 2 year old) daughter for the 15th anniversary celebrations and we had a great time.5 years later and we now have a son to take along too!Absolutely brilliant 3 days in May spent at both parks. Despite the weather forecast predicting heavy rain and thunderstorms we were very fortunate to experience a heatwave!The park is so clean and tidy and there always seemed to be something exciting to see. We saw a few characters wandering around but there were so many people crowded around them we didn't bother going to see them most of the time.We went half board and found lots of lovely places to eat nice healthy(ish) food like sandwiches and wraps. One evening we went to the Plaza Gardens restaurant just at the end of Main Street and it was really good quality tasty food (and it was all you can eat). This is so refreshing compared to the burger and chips that we have come to expect at theme parks. It's true that some people don't seem to think that queueing applies to them and will try and find ways to get past you to get to the front. They may get on a ride 30 seconds before you but who cares? I wasn't going to let something like that ruin my day. In fact the only time it did annoy me was when I was at the front of a queue to pay for some ice lollys and a woman walked over ignoring the queue, leaned over me and waved her money at the guy serving. A short blast of  EXCUSE ME?!  and she stepped back and let me get served. You may need to prepare yourself to be a little bit forceful if the occasion arises.The rides were great as was the parade as expected but the highlight for me was the 20th anniversary night time show 'Disney Dreams'. If you are going to Disneyland this year you HAVE to see this! It started at 10.30pm which we thought was going to be too late for our kids as they would be too tired after walking round the huge park all day but we arrived 40 minutes early for the show and just sat on the ground in front of the castle to rest our throbbing feet. By this time there was already a small crowd so you don't really want to be there much later than this.It is an amazing show so please don't spoil it for yourself by watching it on YouTube before you go. The show features lights, water, music and fireworks as well as all your favourite Disney characters and I have never seen anything like it!This was way better than the 15th anniversary celebrations and if it improves at this rate every 5 years I will be first in line for the 25th anniversary!",Disneyland_Paris

At parade time try to sit early enough to sit on the front of the curb, it's a great photo opportunity.Check what nights they are doing the fireworks they are spectacular, a must see.",Disneyland_Paris

The cabins were clean and modern and accommodated the 6 of us easily .The park itself was fantastic , the rides were great and the Disney staff were very helpful.The only downside was the cost of food in the park, which was very expensive.One advantage of staying at the ranch was we could drive to the nearest town and eat at some fantastic local restaurants.Apart from that it was a great experience and I would highly recommend the Davey Crockett Ranch as a good alternative to the hotels.",Disneyland_Paris

The shows are stunning especial the fireworks at 22.30, for photos turn up early.

130272362,4,2012-5,United Kingdom,"We had four days at Disney and thought it was brilliant.The way it is set out with trees and flower beds and music playing from the various films makes it all that nicer to walk around.very clean,always someone out sweeping up.Staff organised queues well,once one ride had started they got the next lot counted out and ready by the gates to get on.Queues on the Monday and Tuesday were fine about 15 20 minutes but then Wed and Thurs were a lot busier for some reason and had to queue between 40mins and over an hour for some rides.Bit of shoving and pushing going on,shame everybody can't queue like the British!I would have given it an excellent rating had they not cancelled the meet and greet the characters and the parade for two days.They have been advertising the spectacular 20th anniversary parade on T.V.Well I'll never know if it was spectacular or not now.We had been waiting to watch it and they cancelled it last minute,not very impressed.The last day we joined the crowds(didn't bother to wait and get good spot in case it was cancelled again)but couldn't see a thing.Managed to lift my daughter up so she saw some of it.She was also disappointed she couldn't meet the pricesses.Now onto food!There is a sign saying no food to be taken in but we did and saw other people with their picnics.The various eateries that were open all served the same junk food.I wanted to take my daughter to Buzz lightyears pizza planet but it was shut the whole time we were there.Then we wanted to go to Bella Notte thought there might be something other than burger and chips there but that was shut and told us to go to one of the other restaurants but when we got there that was shut and told us to go to another which no doubt would have been shut as well!There is a Mc Donalds in the disney village. So we were really pleased that we had stocked up in Paris with fruit and cartons of juice,crisps etc.. there is a small shop in the train station where we got fresh bread to take in.The rides are absolutely brilliant. My mum and I enjoyed it as much as my 6 year old daughter!We had the pass for the 2 parks and you really wouldn't want much less than 4 days.We didn't get to see all the shows in the studio park but then we did go on some of the rides 4 or 5 times.My daughter has asked if we can go again...I'd better get saving!",Disneyland_Paris

The kids had so much fun! We were there for one whole day and have to admit should have extended for another if it was not because of the limited time to also see other beautiful places in Paris itself.The night carnival and character floats were just beautiful!

All that we expected occurred, but it was worth it. A Disney fan since childhood, I was enthralled by it all. A smile was constantly on my face, even when we were lining up for 90mins. We visted the park and the studios, and i wish we had more time. One day isnt enough! And make sure you stay for the parade, I still have the song in my head. I enjoyed Crush's Coaster the most, it was soooo good!! Indiana jones and the space mountain were also good. Pirates of the Carribean was closed all day, which was annoying as there are not that many rides considering how big the place is. What i disliked the most was the lack of disney themed rides ... as in orginal disney characters. I was expecting a little mermaid ride, or a lion king ride. Something! The closest ride that came to meeting my expectations was Aladdins carpet ride, which is a ride for small children, but still fun. Indiana jones, star tours .. all this stuff i didnt know was disney seemed everywhere!At the end of the day, it was Disneyland, i was in Disneyland. It was totally worth the price, battling the crowds after the parade ended, lining up forever, paying heaps for food and screaming my lungs out on the coasters. Those that say the rides were rough, should stick to the smaller rides, which are plentiful. I would suggest getting souvenirs before doing anything else and getting them to hold it for you, after the parade the shops are packed and overwhelming. I didnt buy all i wanted to.Have fun :)",Disneyland_Paris
130064916,4,2011-6,Romania,"you definitely cannot see disneyland in a reasonably manner in one day. not even in two days. so, provided your hotel is close to the park, you still need a lot of planning in order to be able to go to all attractions in both parks. not to mention the souvenirs shopping, the meals, etc.my tips to future visitors:1. consider spending there at least 2 days2. once you're there, GET A MAP!3. before entering, STUDY the map, taking into consideration: the hours for specific shows, the height limitations (for sure you'll go with kids) AND the attractions that have the FAST PASS access4. consider spending 1 4 of your total time for eating, having a short rest on the alleys, going for no.1 2 with the kids :)5. consider spending 1 2 of your total time there, waiting in the super long queues for each attractionHope that all these will be helpful for you.

130000851,4,2012-5,Germany,"As an avid Disneyland California goer, Disneyland Paris is  charming.  We have been a few times now, and have decided this time that we just prefer California. There is not enough staff involvement in Paris, perhaps because of the economy, or just not enough staff or whatever. Trash is everywhere, things are not fixed up, areas remain empty with nothing entertaining happening even though it could be very nice for the guests, and I feel a lot of space is wasted. It is very pretty, and we do enjoy ourselves. Things are ALWAYS CLOSED! Shops, little food stands, they just close whenever they feel like it, with no reason. The park will say they close at 10:30 but really that means around 7 many food shops and little carts just close. Lame as they are losing possible business! In Disneyland CA, they always want you to feel the magic. You will not see people dragging sopping wet trash bags past your table in a restaurant, leaving a dripping trail of trash wetness...you will not see cars or streets when on rides or trash just swimming in the water. Ah well..go on Thunder Mountain!!! Over and over. Way better than California. Also Pirates is more like the  original  so way better, and Phantom Manor is different than CA (probably florida too, but I havent been). Also, Hakuna Matata (when open!) is the best food in my opinion in the park.  Fast  food but better than the rest.",Disneyland_Paris

129965197,4,2011-8,Australia,"A surprise treat for the children! The children were so excited when they walked out of the station and saw the theme park. We arrived at 10am with my sister in law and her fiance. We were blessed with a warm and sunny day. I was surprised that it wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be especially when it was the summer holidays. We went through the security entrance fairly quickly, took some photos before entering the theme park through the gates where we handed in our tickets. The staff were very helpful when they saw we had baby in the stroller. We surveyed the area as we went through and than checked the maps to see what was of interest to the children. Its worth doing that so you know which direction to go and where you want to finish as it saves time and you going round in circles. The children chose their rides and the ones that had long queues we decided to visit last. Having spare adults certainly helps if you have different age groups. My sister in law and fiance took my 3 older ones and I stayed with baby. My husband was to meet us later in our trip so it was just the children, myself and my sister in law, fiance who offered to help with the children in Disneyland. Baby's changing room was great but a little bit over crowded as expected. The clinic was wonderful and the staff were helpful. I needed a place to breastfeed baby and they happily gave me a seat, pulled the curtains and said if I needed anything I just had to ask. They had strollers in designated areas that were free. Grab one if you have another child under 10. Some of the rides were closed due to maintenance. Hello...it's summer and they should plan ahead so people are not disappointed. One of the better rides was affected by...maintenance!! Anyway, we made the most of it. The kids had fun and just seeing their happy faces made it all worthwhile!!! We spent a fortune especially at the souvenir shop. We arrived at 10am and left at 10pm...very long day but worth it! We went to both theme parks. I suggest 2 days if you have little ones so you get to appreciate your time there and not get over tired and crumpy. You'll miss the point of why you're there! Fortunately, it didn't happen to me because I had help but I saw adults that went crazy. When you looked at the children's sad faces, you wondered why their parents took them there in the first place. Disneyland is a place for happy memories, families and fun for all!",Disneyland_Paris

SpectacularThe biggest challenges with all of Disneyland Paris   s attractions are the queues. It will was great, but perhaps once in a lifetime. Either Disney needs to reduce attendance (yeah right), or build more attractions. It is just not fun queuing 60 minutes or more for 2 minutes of joy.",Disneyland_Paris
129808743,4,2012-5,United Kingdom,"Well where to start, it was a great 3 days and I would advise all with children to give it a go.However there a some downsides and tips for these to help you enjoy your trip.Firstly the queues are long, we spent at least 40 minutes waiting for most rides, therefore Fast Pass any that you can as this cuts waiting down to a few minutes, however you can only do this on certain rides. This can also use up a lot of precious time if your not visiting for long, so as we did get a park guide and work out exactly what your must do's are so you don't waste time and work your way around the park instead of going back and forth between parks which will just result in very tired legs and bad moods!!!!Food is expensive inside the park, for example 8 nuggets, chips and drink was over 10 Euros, so if possible pop to the supermarket in the Eurostar terminal on the way in to the park as you can buy a few snacks to save money. Water was also 3 Euros for a small bottle, so those with small children take bottles with you and fill up at the hotel to save money. Lunch wasn't easy to find as most stalls in the park just sell snacks ( crepes, pretzels, popcorn), so best to admit defeat and just live on junk for the few days your there. We went half board to save money which was great until we realised on the first night that most of the restaurants you can eat in on the tickets shut around 5pm and those that open later are fully booked very quickly, so book your evening meals as soon as you arrive so your not wandering around trying to find somewhere to eat as we did on the first evening.The night time parade at the moment starts at 7pm, so make sure by 6.30pm you have a spot on the pavement that will allow you all to see, its amazing how rude people were when 5 minutes before the start they were trying to push in front of us as they hadn't got a space!!!The fireworks are fantastic although didn't start until 10.15 and once again you will need to queue around an hour before to get a space. Top tip is getting younger children to have a nap mid afternoon so they can still be awake at this time, does only last around 20 minutes so not too late a night.Pushchairs cost around 8 Euros to hire each day and although they don't look very nice or comfortable they are a god send and can easily hold 2 children if they will sit on each others laps, saves tired legs and moaning!!! You do need to leave your pushchair to go on most rides, however there is a space to do this, just remember when loading them up with coats and bags etc you will need to take most of this with you each time you go on a ride.Ponchos cost 7   9 Euros for children   adults so if you have rain coats take them with you to save money.You will see characters around the park however you will find large crowds, best if you are staying at a Disney hotel is to look which characters will be there each morning as there are usually 2 around 10am and the queues are not so large and over a few days you will see most of them.To avoid shopping in the park, the Disney hotels also have shops and they all tend to sell the same merchandise and if you buy at your hotel it saves carrying it around in the park all day.After learning all the above I would go back in a heartbeat as it was certainly a great way to spend 3 days just being a child in a very Magical world.",Disneyland_Paris
129807695,5,2011-7,United Kingdom,"I am writing this review as I felt I should after reading all the others and it seems to be a mixed response. I absolutely love Disney, everything to do with it. I go to the Disney store all the time in England just to browse most of the time but if I see a special badge then I get it. Anyway back to the Park, I love it I have been many times over the years and have loved it every time even with my parents being sceptical over it. Last time I went was in 2010 and I went on my own for a special birthday treat as I was left some money so I treated myself to the best hotel (the Disney Hotel). The whole experience was overwhelming, everytime I see the fireworks display I always get happy tears in my eyes, I love it. My favourite ride is the Space Mountain rollercoaster and my second fav is the Peter Pan's Flight ride. I would totally recommend this park to anyone who loves Disney and has a grown up watching Disney films. I don't know about the price of the food as I don't really pay to much attention to those things, I always say that it doesn't matter how much it costs as long as you have a good time.I did this on my own last time I went and I would say it was one of the best times I have spent on my own, I don't see why you can't have fun on your own just as much as you would have with a child with you.Next time I review this I will be reviewing from the point of view of having four in the party.

129806660,1,2011-9,United Kingdom,"Nearly a year after we went our (now 5 year old daughter) still comments that 'they weren't very nice' She means the staff. The Paris park does no credit whatsoever to the US version. We were perhaps naieve to think that the magical branding of disney would be international, the french version is very much intended for the french to the exclusion of other nations. It's hard to explain to small children who know the words to their favourite disney films that it may be the same tune but with different words (french!) In short the whole park attitude had the typical shoulder shrug of the french when parades were re routed with no announcements and children invited to join other parades and then shooed away when they had enough kids to look the part   again hard to explain to small kids. I read other review sites before visiting and also have to agree with other visitors about the lack of characters around the park to see or meet for photos. The only one we did see walking around was the scary looking queen from alice in wonderland who had a full head mask, not great for small kids! If your children visit and can see straight through the facade to the rotten core then its best to give it a miss, save a little longer and go to visit the real thing, Where the magic is in the attitude of the staff rather than on the wording if the billboard. Oh and the toliets were filthy even first thing in the morning when it first opened.",Disneyland_Paris
129804265,4,2012-5,United Kingdom,"Went here this week for three days. Really loved it. It's a bit of a fantasy land, and is my third visit overall. The current closing ceremony and light   firework display is well worth seeing. Kids will love the parade as well. The pirates of the Carribean ride, its a small world, and and the automobile cars ride are really worth doing. All them shops are well themed. Main Street USA and Fantasyland were my favourite areas. Plenty to do for cowards like me who don't like the big 'thrill' rides. Only niggles is some of the staff are a bit surly, and food and drink is really pricy (and variable in quality). If you can I would only recomend going in low mid season like we did, as otherwise you will do nothing but que for most of the day, (and you will still do plenty in low mid season, but usually only 10 20 minutes max per ride).

The disneyland park is very visually attractive , clean, and Expensive!! For example, popcorn costs about 6 9 euros... thats expensive!! Except for the roller coaster rides in every segment, all rides and attractions are aimed at kids about 5 9 yrs. Elder kids may not really enjoy the park as much as their younger counterparts. Also be prepared to stand in long queues for upto an hour, for popular rides.Nonetheless, we had a good time, but i guess my expectations were a notch higher , specially for slightly older kids and adults.(over 9 years). This however does not take away from the magic of disney!! A last thing... 2 days are more than enough to cover this attraction....",Disneyland_Paris
129642050,5,2012-5,United Kingdom,"We visited the park on a busy public holiday in May. We had lots of reservations regarding how busy it would be and with 3 children aged 2,6 and 8 were worried we would spend the whole time in a queue. We didn't.Tip 1   do your research into the rides and plan your days. My wife did this perfectly and so we made the best use of the magic hours in the morning and the fast pass system. Even though it was one of the busiest days we never queued for more than 5 minutes. We couldn   t understand why there were so many people waiting for an hour  for some rides. Tip 2   make best use of the Fast Pass system, it works perfectly. Slide your card through the machine and you get a time. It appears that as long as you use it after that time you will be fine. After 2 hours you can get another one. We made sure we got these everytime we could and so built up a collection of them that we used whenever we wanted to. We were also given some at the hotel and as we checked in late on Friday they gave us our Friday passes but dated them for a day of our choice. Tip 3   There are some rides that the fast pass system doesn   t work for so go there first thing or last thing. Tip 4   We enjoyed the park after dinner in the evenings when there were no queues at all. The kids loved Thunder Mounain so we did it 5 times on the trot in the evening without any wait. Tip 5   Fancy Dress   if your children are young and happy to dress up then the whole family can use Thunder Mountain via the Fastpass line as many times as they want if they are dressed as cowboys (or Jess from Toy Story). The same applies if you dress as Buzz for the Buzz Lightyear ride. Both of these had big queues during the day. Tip 6   The    Baby Switch    system works well. You don   t have to have a baby but a child that doesn   t want to go on a ride. As you go through the gates ask the attendant for a baby switch voucher and they give you a piece of paper that allows your partner to then jump to the front of the queue with up to 2 children. This is done well and you don   t feel awkward. There is no time limit on these so every ride we got one of these and then used them during the day if there were any queues or if the fast pass system didn   t apply to a ride. I think it would even be possible to do without a child but I   m not advocating this!!!Tip 7   Make good use of the Magic Hours (see below)Tip 8   Take my wife's crib sheet with you. These were the top tips that my wife wrote down for us to take into the park.

129641579,2,2012-5,United Kingdom,"in a nutshell.....this was our second visit and please dont waste your money, save another wee while and go to florida. A poor replication of the real disney magic, horrible rude staff and people visiting it, crowds and queues for parades etc insane and stressful due to people. Food disgusting and too expensive for what it is. Everything you encounter is done properly in florida and poorly in france. previous reviews make reference to the fact that the staff are rude because we are visiting their country and not speaking french....that is a crazy comment   this is DISNEY and the staff should bend over backwards to help you as they do in usa (apart from that my husband speaks fluent french and was still treated with contempt and arrogance).  the only saving grace we had was the extra magic hour we had in morning when the kids had fun on their favourite rides without the scrum of rude people pushing in front of them....at one point a couple actually knocked their own child out of her buggy they were rushing so hard to get in front of us! the whole day felt chaotic....people pushing children to get at front of parade...in u. s there are various parades and so it doesnt feel so pressured.please listen to me....save for another while and book florida!",Disneyland_Paris
129633940,4,2012-1,France,"I have never been to Disney in the States so I can not compare Disney France with Disney USA and i am sure those of you who have done the two will have your own personnel preference but here goes ........My Trip.Living in Paris we have been lucky enough to visit Disney on numerous occasions. We used to have a yearly pass so when the kids were small we went every other week. In my experience Disney is always good fun, the shows are always professional the staged street houses and gardens are always beautiful the rides don't change so if you like a ride the experience will be the same next time round!! It is also true to say the queues are always long the food is expensive and not great quality and the kids always want you to spend lots of money on toys sweets hats umbrellas sweat shirts etc which get dumped once at home. ( We got around this problem by dressing the kids in a Disney t shirt and always taking a Disney toy with us) It is amazing how the marketing works on you once you get through the Disney doors !!! The staff are French on the whole and there certainly is not an atmosphere of jolly comradeship and sometimes they can be quite sour though I promise you that for the French they are doing a very very good job at trying to be really nice, it's just not the same culture as an Anglo Saxon  American one. A word of warning, watch the weather forecast as if it is wet in Paris Disney will be wetter, the same goes for the cold, the sun, the wind etc.......we have been caught out on numerous occasions. So wrap up or down, take a picnic and comfy shoes don't expect the staff to smile all day and you will have great fun!",Disneyland_Paris
129600530,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"We spent 4 days here at the end of April and have to say that it was absolutely perfect (weather excepted ....heavy rain showers on the 1st day and then heavy rain on the 2nd day!) The park itself is just incredible and my 5 year old daughter was completely overwhelmed by the magic kingdom and loved all the rides (especially the Peter Pan ride which is well worth queuing for.) We went to the Auberge De Cendrillon for the Disney Princess meal and have to say it was worth every penny. There were 90minute queues in the park for a meeting with a princess and you don't get to choose which one you meet (and it is ONLY 1.) It's worth spending the money on the dinner to meet lots of princesses and avoid the princess queue which a lot of people were disappointed with. My 23month old son absolutely loved all the rides as well and I was very surprised that he was allowed on nearly all of them so it was a great family experience. The studios were amazing as well and the Cars stunt show featuring Lightening McQueen is well worth a watch. Food is expensive but if you plan ahead and take sandwiches and snacks and drinks in with you then you can keep costs down. We had a few meals and shows pre booked and paid for so that saved us money while we were there (and the hassle of queuing etc.) Had read reviews about there not being any characters around the park but we saw LOADS! My children met and had pics with Peter Pan and Wendy, the evil Snow White queen, Baloo the bear, Mickey Mouse and lots of others. Have to say though most importantly ........ the Disney Dreams laser show at night around the castle and firework display is absolutely sensational. DO NOT MISS. It was magical. We've been back 2weeks nearly now and my daughter is pleading with me to take her back. Made me feel like a child again and when Rapunzel waved to my daughter and blew her a kiss I was just as excited as she was. Just PERFECT : )",Disneyland_Paris
129580950,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"I love EuroDisney, that was what it was called when I went there when it opened and I can't think of it as anything else    Disney with a European twist. The park is clean, lots of toilets and has loads of space. Just walking around it is fun. My children love going even though they are teenagers now. If you don't like Disney films and they and therir music didn't win a place in your heart when you were a child then it may be hard for you to share the visceral, emotional response we have when we are there. We also view it in a competitive light: we are there to do the maximum number of rides, with the minimum of queuing. This means using the early entry you get from staying in an onsite hotel and making sure you know in advance which rides are actually open early and using the FastPass system properly. If you ask the staff, they are very good at explaining and are very helpful albeit in a slightly brusque Gallic way. Peter Pan is one of the most lovely and busy rides while Pinnochio and Snow White are also notably European in feel; they are little kids rides but grown ups love them too. My kids are now old enough to love Space Mountain but haven't outgrown Small World and I have yet to meet anyonw who doesn't love the BuzzLight year ride. The one thing that has worsened over the years is the food. Once Upon a Time it was possible to have a fabulous meal in the Auberge de Cendrillon or the restaurant inside the Pirates of the Caribbean ride but the menus and atmosphere have changed and the queuing for sustenance is sometimes worse than that for rides. It's also very dear. Eat before and if you are hungry whilst there I would recommend a trip outside to the serviceable cafe in the RER station or the little fast food caravan by the entrance.",Disneyland_Paris
129580377,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"After reading other holiday goers reviews I was a little apprehensive but there was no need. We had a wonderful holiday. Every member of staff we encountered were so friendly and made our stay great. Most rides had less than 15 minute queue time which was good as we had a little 4 year old with us. The ones that did have a larger queue (which were hardly any) we either did in Magic hours time, or fast passed it. The reviews i had previously read about the public toilets being in awful conditions were also untrue during our visit. We regularly saw cleaning attendants in the many toilets we visited. The whole holiday was great and we thought good value too. Will be recommending to friends.",Disneyland_Paris
129566822,4,2011-12,Greece,"Was my first time in a roller coster, had a blast! was really nice to meet mickey mouse in person an Buzz...from Toy story!! The stand man show was also great to watch! the nearby hotels were really good too and well organised for transportation. the unfortunate thing is that meals are very expensive even in fast food places inside the park!",Disneyland_Paris
129545420,4,2012-5,United Kingdom,"We spent 4 days in the park at the beginning of May. First day was all over the place   there is so much to see and the queues for everything are so long, you can spend all day standing in them! We didn't use FastPass as it wasn't available on anything my girls wanted to go on, but could see it was a great idea and well worth using for the more popular rides. The park is split into 4 lands   Fantasyland being the biggest. We spent 2 days waiting for the queues to see the Princesses in the Princess Pavilion to go down but, tbh, they didn't so you may as well just bite the bullet and go get in the q at a time that works for you. The hour long queue was worth it though ...........the look on my daughter's face when she got to meet Belle was priceless   so much so that we queued the day after for another hour to meet another princess!If you're with little ones (ours are 8 and 6), almost all the rides are suitable   mine loved Its a small world ( a boat cruise through lots of dolls from all over the world) and the Storybook cruise. However, the queues for the Pinocchio ride were massive and I would say, unless you are a huge fan, it's really not worth bothering with.The Parade at night, however, is amazing and my girls felt like every one of the characters had waved at them personally, which I guess is the magic of Disney. You need to be sat somewhere on the parade route (marked on the guides) by about half 6 at the latest to get a good view but it really is worth the wait.We had a brilliant time and if we could afford it I'd take the girls back every year.............if you've got little girls who love the Disney princesses, and all the fairy tales, it is definitely worth the money.",Disneyland_Paris

129501858,5,2012-3,United Kingdom,"This is a great park is you know all the tricks. After reading so many negative reviews, it is clear that a lot of people have terrible experiences because they allow themselves to spend a fortune on food and wait in hideously long queues. Don't let this happen to you.Trick 1   bring lots of snacks if you have kids. We had our two nieces with us and did not want them feasting on sweets all day, so we brought carrot sticks, sandwiches, juice, cheese and other healthy goodies in a rucksack. Over the two days this saved us a small fortune (park snacks are so pricey) and kept our kids from going into sugar overload.Trick 2   stay in a park hotel and make use of magic mornings. If you stay in one of the park hotels you get to enter the parks an hour before everyone else and make use of a few popular rides before they become really crowded. This makes a big difference.Trick 3   understand how fastpass works. There is never a reason to wait in a long queue in this park if you plan well. Almost all of the rides with long queues have fastpass as an option. This system is most helpful if used heavily during the first half of the day.Trick 4   flee at peak time. If you are staying in one of the nearby themed hotels, there is no point in enduring the mobs that hit the park between 1pm and 3pm. Run away. Most of the themed hotels have good themed spas, pools and activites. Go have a rest and come back for the evening as the park starts to get quieter. If you can, fast pass one ride before you leave that has a long lag time on the fast pass so you can walk back into the park two or three hours later and immediately jump onto another ride.Trick 6   be aware of which rides have slow queues and which rides have fast ones. As an example, Peter Pan has a very slow queue and can have painfully long lines by midday. The same is true of Indiana and Thunder Mountain. In contrast, Pirates and Phantom Manor move people through quickly and rarely have wait times that are anywhere near as long. Use this information to prioritise the rides you visit during the day. Always visit slow queue rides as early as you can or fastpass them.",Disneyland_Paris

129351891,5,2012-5,United Kingdom,"Just back from a 2 day visit to both disney parks.top tips:  Bring sandwiches, drinks, sweets, snacks   everything is so expensive.  Do the fast pass, particularly for buzz lightyear and peter pan (if you have little ones)  Do at least one character dining (we did cowboy cookout   food awful, but my 3 year old loved it).  Stay for the nightime parade   it's spectacular  Do the princess pavillion   this was an absolute highlight (if you have princess fans).  Stand up for yourself in queues   i noticed a lot of Europeans don't understand or choose to ignore the concept of queuing in an orderly fashion and are quite happy to cut in front or not queue at all   this applies to queues for rides, photographs, shops, cafes   anywhere really.  Bring a buggy   a lot of walking for little legs.  Bring a brolly or a poncho or wet gear (it really is expensive in the parks).  Arriving in time for rope drop at 10am meant we got to go on a lot of the rides in fantasy land with no queues at all.   Consider staying outside the parks (we stayed in Val D'Europe) and it was so much cheaper and only 2 minutes on the RER.  We ate in the Earl of Sandwich one day   perfectly fine and cheap as chips.

129257159,2,2012-5,United States,"To set things straight: this was our first Disney experience, and may have well been our last. At least in Europe... We were mitigating our expectations, which in case of people who grew up behind the Iron Curtain dreaming about places like this is not that easy, even many years later and with a happy kid of our own, now living in much better world. But despite being careful about that, we left with the sense of disappointment.True, the Park is impressive, terrain is appointed beautifully, some of the attractions are great, other average. True, Disney has a lot of capital from its movies and characters. But it is an opportunity lost. And it's not about dirty and smelly toilets, or lousy Ipad app or web page. It's about many little things that overshadow whatever  Disney experience  is was supposed to be. Queues were terrible. We did not manage to find an attraction with waiting time less than 30 minutes, for a ride of 3. We did eventually see Mickey at the parade at 7 pm   and none of the characters throughout the day. Nor have we seen experienced any sort of help advice interest courtesy from the pretty much absent staff. We were informed, that number of restaurants close at 5 pm   just when we planned to grab something to eat, which left us running around to find anything open. And once we found it, the queue to the toilet for kids was about 15 minutes waiting time. And that's only after you wait another 15 minutes for the table. And then because of the toilet queue you can't watch the parade because, as everywhere, there's just too many people to find a good spot   and the number of people is eventually the biggest issue throughout the visit. You just try to navigate through crowd while trying not to lose your kid instead of focusing on what is nice out there. And when you top it all up with the regular ticket prices   it then becomes quite ridiculous. We left in the evening, with the impression we were welcome to spend money big time, and not at all bother to ever come back. Disappointed by Disney. Disappointed by the American type service quality we expected in this place, we love, we miss and we found none of. Disappointed by way management doesn't seem to even try to make things right. And so we spent the next day in Le Bourget Air and Space Museum   different concept, different place, fraction of a price, at least double the fun for kids and their parents.",Disneyland_Paris

129115102,3,2011-9,United States,"I travelled here for my Birthday after a much anticipated wait, 6 Disneyland visits, and 20  Walt Disney World visits. The park is not well situated considering it has not grown enough to be a destination in and of itself. We spent 3 nights in Paris and then finagled the RER to spend 3 nights in Marne la Vallee at the horrific Hotel Sante Fe, but that is for another review. Every morning you must go through long security lines and x ray machines to get to the parks and it is not surprising to see armed guards walking about the train station, not exactly the Disney Experience Walt had in mind. Once inside, the park itself is quite stunning. The castle is so unique and I like that the rides were not cookie cutter duplications of the US rides. The grounds were well kept despite several refurbishments in progess. One item of note, the Park does not forecast its operational updates very well on the website. When we booked (a little under two months out) only the Alice in Wonderland Labryinth was supposed to be closed during our trip, but by the time our trip time came, Phantom Manor and Indiana Jones were the actual closed attractions which was a HUGE let down. The Park certainly looks and feels like Disney until it comes time to interact with the Cast and other guests. There is hardly any customer service in the park, and apparently no manners or common decency. The guests have no concept of personal space and continually crowd and bump you in lines. One or twice I understand, but a grown up should not be continuously crowding you and blatantly attempting to jump the line. Rampant smoking in lines was also a problem. The cast members did absolutely nothing to address line jumpers or smoking. I also witnessed a Mother allow her children, boy and girl to urinate (openly) on a bush in the queue. Appalling!During our trip, the park closed at 6PM each night. Disney Village gets old after one night so there was a lot of boredom after the park closes, especially since the last place we wanted to be was in the hotel room.Overall, I am glad I went just to see it, but the rude guests and cast members sucked all of the  Disney Magic  out of the experience. The Cast Members in particular need a good re training in the Disney Way.",Disneyland_Paris

128850015,2,2012-4,United States,"Don't see too many  middle of the road  reviews here, but after finally going to Disneyland Paris with my wife and 2 small kids I can honestly say that the good stuff is there, along with the bad. I'm glad I did this for myself, but I would never visit this park again unless there were some serious changes.The good:  Dinner at Cafe Mickey was the highlight. The food was edible    not great but not bad    and by itself would be considered overpriced. However, you're not paying for the food, you're paying for the show. And its not really a show, its 5 separate Disney characters coming out and visiting every single table, taking their time to pose for pictures, play with the guests, etc. Its really well done, and afterwards a manager visits each table to ensure that each character visited.   The attractions were mostly fun, and despite all the hassles listed below, my kids still had a great time.The Bad  In a nutshell: the park is poorly managed, from rides, parking, concessions, and sanitation. There are fewer rides and activities than the parks in the U.S., instead there are lots of places to buy overpriced food and souvenirs. The park is also smaller than in the U.S., or at least feels that way.  Rides weren't managed well, in terms of getting people on and off (which took longer than many of the rides). The train that runs around the park ran super slow because they only ran half the trains.   Pirates of the Caribbean is shorter than the one in the U.S., and its so dark its hard to see.   Not enough bathrooms and they were disgusting. Given the   of sanitation codes in the EU, I'm surprised they haven't been shut down yet. Long waits, and we went on a rainy weekday...can't imagine this during the peak season.  Food was a total rip off, as everyone says.  Unlike the U.S. parks, smoking is allowed everywhere (in the U.S., its only in a few designated areas). Parents smoking in tight lines, blowing smoke and ashes to everyone around them...it was really, really bad.If you've never been to a Disney park and can't get to the U.S., this might be worth it. But if you have a choice between this and one of the U.S. parks, go to the U.S.",Disneyland_Paris

128750695,3,2012-4,United Kingdom,"Having visited Florida twice and Disneyland Paris twice before I kind of knew what to expect but this was the first Disney trip with my 3 year old daughter and I think I forgot how horrendous queuing with a toddler is! We spent 3 nights and 4 days at the parks and managed to cover most attractions in this time. I will break my review into positive and negative points as I want people to have a good idea of what it's like there.Positives:* Character meet and greets due to the rain we found quite a few characters with no queue which was a bonus!* Cafe Mickey meal with characters  my 3 year old thought she was in heaven when Mickey came to our table, no dinner will ever be the same again for her!* Buffalo Bill's wild west show amazing live action show featuring real cowboys, Native Americans, buffalo, cattle and lots of horses!* The 20th anniversary light show was amazing, I have never seen anything like it before and it was well worth a visit.* Fastpass well worth doing if you plan your rides ahead of time.* Parades  my daughters face lit up when we saw the stars with cars parade. Negatives:* The state of the toilets in the parks  at times they were dirty and at other times disgusting. I do not think Walt Disney would approve of faeces smeared all over them!* The prices of food and drink take your own or buy in the station shop outside the park.* The rudeness of the French  I know that may be contraversial but when they blow cigarette smoke in your childs face whilst waiting for a queue and proceed to queue jump and barge you out of the way it begins to grate on you!* The overhyped security, long queues just to get into the park as bags are xrayed through one tired looking machine and french police wandering about with big guns just outside the park!* Queues everywhere, wouldn't be so bad but as one previous reviewer noted many are uncovered which in the rain is not much fun!Overall it was a good experience with some drawbacks but my 3 year old had the time of her life and that's all that matters, after all if your kids are happy then i'm happy!",Disneyland_Paris

There are plenty of affordable child freindly attractions there e.g. Bois de bologne, jardin luxembourg, the Paris aquarium...... If you are smart you can also eat well at reasonable cost too. In summary, thoroughly disappointed and made all the worse knowing that central Paris is only 30 mins away.",Disneyland_Paris
128594408,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"I was skeptical as to whether I'd enjoy the experience at all but even approaching the Disney Hotel (above the park entrance) the magic starts, you can't fail to be amazed   the happiest place on Earth! It's the larger and more popular park of the two, so it can get crowded, but there are plenty of eateries and places to sit outside in fair weather. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was our favorite ride (with someone not quite tall enough for other rides). It suffered from chronic reliability issues though, twice we queued for 40 mins to then be turned away due to failure! Parades are amazing and the 20th anniversary fireworks display is a incredible spectacle.",Disneyland_Paris

128571430,4,2012-4,Ireland,"I think the park itself is fantastic. We travelled as a couple with a 3 year old. I felt that the time we travelled was probably wrong, it was raining and cold the whole time and queuing for long periods without being able to bring a buggy through the queue was hard. I think the park is more for 6  years whena buggy is not neccessary and they can go on more",Disneyland_Paris
128542556,4,2012-4,United Kingdom,"A magical , not to be missed holiday . Visited Easter 2012. We were all blown away ...... Tips: For anything over a 2 day visit   consider the annual pass ON YOUR FIRST DAY!! Be prepared and take your passports with you . We paid approx 320 euros day one for 2 adults and one child into both parks. On our second day we went to buy a further 2 day pass and it cost 377 euros compared to an annual pass of about 477 . In our case parking for the motorhome cost 30 euros a day but that could include camping overnight so we managed an unplanned 6 day visit to Disney which cost us about 200 euros when we took off our parking and campsite fees . We can now visit 320   364 days of the year so we will be back ! The only downside to Disney , and I cannot understand why, is the food and choice of food. Absolutely dreadful!! Microwaved burgers, chicken burgers and fries at most places..... no salad, veg or anything remotely decent. One night we decided to choose what we thought could be a decent eating establishment   Billy Bobs in the Disney Village   IT WAS SHOCKING FOOD !!! and their service , and attitude to the SHOCKING FOOD was even worse. Large coolbags will be confiscated ..... small sandwiches, crisps , apples etc will be fine....in separate bags. We actually didnt find the queuing time bad at all. You can always fasttrack most rides (book  your ride time in advance) 40 mins was the max we queued and our 6 year old never complained once ! and O.M.G ...... the parades and the evening show !!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
128530654,3,2012-4,United Kingdom,"Well, all I can say is how disappointed I am with Disneyland Paris on the whole.Before anyone jumps up and says  Well it is France  that is no excuse for Disneyland staff to  no speak English .. I'm not in rural, non tourist France here, it's Disneyland for goodness sake, English should be the international language... For example  Chocolate Fudge Brownie  in the Ben and Jerry's shop got lost in translation, so too did  Happy Meal  in McDonalds... These are just two of the endless examples I could give.Having visited a few times in the past I NEVER remembered it being like this, there seems to be some sudden surge of French independence... If you have children who aren't fluent in French, honestly and sincerely, do not waste your time with Disneyland Paris because I think the magic was greatly taken away... I've been to all the Disney's and Paris is the least magical by far... Go to Florida!Positives? The firework display was wonderful.",Disneyland_Paris

The only bonus was the minimal queuing for rides.",Disneyland_Paris
128517859,4,2012-4,Australia,"Very well maintained and easy to access Disney. Many public transport options and reasonable parking rates very close to the park. Also good value for money because you can do two parks on the one ticket and the theme park is open until 9:30pm and Studios until 7:00. Also, the fast track option of booking your attraction beforehand is a great idea that works well. Plus it doesn't cost extra like lots of other parks. Pity no one tells you about it.

Food and drinks very expensive in the park 4 euros for a small beer . Earl of sandwich is a good eating house , use fast passes when possible , all staff very friendly . Santa Fe hotel is a good place to stay   you only use the room to sleep and shower   there was plenty for breakfast inc packing up an overall magical experience for all of us . spent 3 nights and 4 full enjoyable days break . there is a courtiesy bus to and from the Disney hotels .",Disneyland_Paris

That is why we decided to go back this year to the 20th anniversary celebrations and take my 6year old niece for her birthday so that she too could experience the magic. HOW WRONG WERE WE. I couldnt believe how much the atmosphere and everything had changed. The prices of everything from toys right down to food was an absolute rip off (portion of 6 chicken nuggets   7, can of coke   3) and there were hardly any characters about the park only at certain points at certain times and even then if you were not lucky enough to be one of the first 10 15 in the queue then your child was sent away being told  No more we are closed . Imagine the sheer dissappointment on the faces of 100s of excited little children waiting to see their favourite characters :( now we dont see that on the adverts do we...NO.On the plus side the character dinner was more of a hit with several Princesses visiting our table to actually talk to our little Princess (but we did actually pay   350 for the privelege).And the absolutely amazing lazer light show was the highlight of our4 day visit and I wouldnt have missed that for all the tea in China even if we did have to get our spot 2 hours before the show and stay put until it started.

Never had any problems with the cleaning of the bathroom or bedroom.The buffet breakfast was good, can be busy towards the end of the breakfast shift but all in all seated quick enough.The best thing about hotel is that the kids can use the Jacuzzi in the pool, our little ones LOVED it. All in all we really enjoyed our break and time at newyork hotel and we will return next summer:)Have stayed other disney hotels over the years, would always go back to new York (until finances allow us to stay in the main Disneyland hotel!

A regular visitor here (and advocate of their Annual Passports for those like myself), I always enjoy escaping the 'everyday' and becoming a kid again. Yes, it's an expensive trip, especially if you stay at one of the Disney hotels, but if you book Eurostar separately (and early) and make the most of Disneyland's regular discounts, then it's worth the outlay. Been as a couple, as a family and with friends...each time very different, each time just as special : )",Disneyland_Paris

The night display is nothing short of awesome   however views are limited if your short   I need spine realignment !! The parade is also fantastic. The park is exceptionally clean. The park is MEGA expensive for drinks and food. My tip is to bring as many drinks snacks and the like into the park. The queue for the princesses was also horrendous (2hrs). We used fast passes for most of the bigger rides which worked really well, The little rides weren't too bad either 20 30 mins. Everything I expected and more !!",Disneyland_Paris

The plus side was a lot of the disney shows are good and the castle lights show was the best ever seen .We stayed bat the Santa fFe hotel the room was ok but breakfast was the worst experience ever it was like camping plastic plates and a cheap continental breakfast and not enough room to sit down,We will go over the water in future to America",Disneyland_Paris

Wasn't taken care of as well, paint not touched  up and a little trash around the park.  Space Mountain is better in Paris. Does three loops! Rock n Roller coaster was not as good as Fl.

128402360,5,2012-3,France,"We went there on a weekday and thus were able to avoid the long waiting lines. Maximum waiting time was around 20 minutes except for Peter Pan ride towards the end of the day. Many attractions close by 6'o clock so be sure to check the closing times of all the rides beforehand. That will allow you to make the most of your day. It will be a good idea to look at the available attractions beforehand otherwise you can feel lost initially in the Park. Must watch rides it's a small world: Children will love it too Peter Pan's Flight Big Thunder Mountain: For the people who love roller coasters Phantom Manor: Creepy but a nice to relax towards the end of the day Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril: For roller coaster lovers Pirates of the Caribbean: Nice to relax and roam around. Good for children Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast: Good for children but we enjoyed blasting the evil Z too  Space Mountain: Mission 2: Best roller coaster as far as I am concernedYou can get a fast pass, one at a time, for some of the major rides to avoid the lines and jump right ahead in the queue. Think of taking them for the roller coasters. Mix the big rides with other attractions to make the best use of time. Waiting time for disney train are long even on weekdays and places are few. Take the train at main station to be able to get a place. Walk around the park is also quite interesting. Remember to get good places to see the parade at 5 pm. Look for the place around 4:30, otherwise difficult to find them later on. Restaurants and eateries are available aplenty (may be a little bit too much) as is the shops selling memorabilia. Wares in these shops are very expensive.Make sure to reach there as early as possible. You will you the whole day easily. The park opens at 10 AM. I havent been to Disney studios but if you want to visit that take the 2 day ticket. It is advisable to buy the tickets online to avoid lines at the entry. You can also find some offers. Avoid weekends as much as possible.",Disneyland_Paris
128396001,4,2012-4,United Kingdom,"Firstly, let me start by saying that the 3 of us had a very good time, and most importantly, my 6 year old son had  the best holiday of his life . I was glad we went, and over all we enjoyed ourselves, howeer ot could, and in my opinion should have been so much better.See me other reviews for restaurant and hotel reviews.Arriving:Arrived by Eurostar direct to station next to Disneyland Paris. Signage could have been very much clearer, should have been a lot easeir to get out and find out hotel (Disneyland hotel). I thought some of the signage was poor and often pointing in the wrong direction. But then again, perhaps I was grumpy because it was raining, very hard,Once we'd checked in (Disneyland Hotel, highly recommended, VIP Fast Pass as we had a club room, a definite must have), we made our way into the park.I was very impressed, it looks ace. Main Street is brilliant, and very well themed. The different 'lands' were all done very well, the rides were good, but I was a bit disappointed that there weren't better rollercoasters for 'grown ups' but then perhaps DLP is more aimed at younger families than those in USA.I cannot recall all of the rides we went on, but here are the highlights and low lights, so to speak.Big Thunder Mountain. Excellent, worth the queue, even with the Fast Pass. Try it at night, it makes it a lot scarier.Hollywood Tower Hotel (in Studios Park). Awesome, hated   loved every second of it. Fast Pass available.Crushes Coaster (in Studios Park). Brilliant, very fast and the fact that you can ride most of it backwards gave a new meaning to the word Scared. However no Fast Pass, the queues are MASSIVE. Go very early in the morning.Flying Carpets of Agrabah (Studios) standard fairground ride, 6 year liked it. Fast Pass.Slinky Dog (Studios) Bobbins, 6 year old thought it was 'OK'Its a Small World   Average, irritating song will stay with me until I die.Pirates of the Caribbean   Rubbish, was expecting a roller coaster, got a gondola ride with plastic figures. Fast Pass.Phantom Manor   impressive when floor starts dropping away, everything else is rubbish. Long queues, no idea why.Riverboat   Good, gently cruise round the lake.Swiss Family Robinson Treehouse (not a ride, just a walk) good actually. Great views.Alice Labyrinth   good, annoying and good.Carousel   Standard but massive queues, partially down to the fact that they only fill is about 75% full. Why?Peter Pan Flight   Good, best of the sit down and be transported through lands type ride. fast PassPinnochio   Rubbish, probably the worst of the sit down and be transported through lands type ride.We also enjoyed playing in the Pocohontas Playground (very good) and the Pirates Beach Playground, not as good. The Pirate ship is a disappointment, was expecting to explore, but instead you can only go on the deck, but the cave system nearby is brilliant. Especially brilliant when you stumble across to teenagers 'necking' in one of the caves and your 6 year old son shouts  Get a Room! .The daily parades are pretty good, however I was disappointed that all of the characters in the park were 'scheduled' and the queues were often massive. I thought they'd be wandering about more.We beneifitted by staying in the Disneyland hotel, which was very good. and had Character breakfasts and some evening meals.The best thing about the whole 4 days was the Disney Dreams show projected onto the castle. On our last night we secured a good spot at about 8pm and waited it out, to be treated with a very impressive show. Must not be missed.So there are a few negaitives and a load of positives there, but my biggset gripes were:1. State of the Toilets. Honestly some were like the bowels of hell. in 5 days, the 3 of us never saw a single cleaner   toilet attendant. We saw toilets blocked to overflowing, with no toilet paper (a lot), with no seat covers (almost all), with broken hand dryers (often) with no hand towels (almost all), the sinks were generally utterly soaking, so a child would get his sleeves drenched just by leaning on the work tops. For the cost of entry, I'd have thought clean well served toilets were an absolute must. 2. Cost and quality of food. Honestly? It was utterly disgraceful. You'll pay    50 for 2 hotdogs, a brownie, a Sprite and 2 cups of Tea. Seriously. We ate at the Silver Spur Steakhouse, which cost us    150 for 3, it was abysmally bad. See my full review.The best food was the Earl of Sandwich cafe in Disney Village, or the Buffet in our hotel. Both reviewed in full. The standard of food is dreadful and they'll charge you easily 4x the odds for it. Captive Audience, but so disappointing considering it is in France (world captial of food) and is an American theme park (usually at least decent fries!).Would I go again? No. Am I glad we went? Yes.",Disneyland_Paris
128387665,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"Stayed in a villa this time owned by Citea,nice ,cheap and cheerful,which lets face it is all you need,you are in the park most of the time!The Park itself must be struggling for attendance as it was very quiet,and we were allowed to go around again on certain rides and hardly any queues,which our kids loved!",Disneyland_Paris
128357720,1,2012-4,Italy,I am surprised the management at Disneyland have not incorporated the latest in line and crowd control. It is hard to wait for 40 minutes in a line with a child. Makes the experience tortuous and you will stand there telling your child to be patient and vowing never to return to Disneyland. It is worth a transatlantic ticket to go to the parks in America that have better roller coasters rides and less line wait times. Hellish experience. We have vowed to never go back.,Disneyland_Paris
128343981,2,2012-4,United Kingdom,"My husband was part of the management team that opened Disney 20 years ago. He had been looking forward to going back with our five year old but instead felt let down. I was glad that he    a Disneyphile    felt that way because it validated my own sense of disappointment. Why would we not go back and not recommend Disney to others? Let us count the ways...* expensive. At   51pp, you expect certain standards. Read on...* crowded. In April post school holidays, we still only managed eight rides in the day. You do the math.* smoking. It appears they allow people to smoke in a children's theme park. Say something to a smoker blowing in your face and you risk an uprising.* cleanliness: what can I say? It was filthy and toilets more so. We did not see cleaners until evening.* food offer: poor quality, limited choice and extortionate (and we are from central London...)* several rides out of actionGrosso modo...we won't be back and for a family with strong Disney ties and memories, that is saying a lot.",Disneyland_Paris

128329205,4,2012-4,United Kingdom,"Firstly Disney rides, attractions and concepts are as brilliant as ever and exactly as seen in the brochures, so I am going to keep this review practicalThings not to miss:The Car Stunt Show in the Walt Disney StudiosThe Wild West Show in the Village ( not included in your entry price)Parades and ShowsMust see   Stars and their Cars   if you have car mad child with you Dream Show   9.15pm   Amazing Firework and Animation show, lasts about 20mins. Position yourself as close to the Fairy Castle as you can for this.Queue time for rides just after Easter was 35mins   on the limit for waiting with a 6 year old.FoodFast Food   Is not Fast Food, the ordering system is inefficient and staff are not organise. Quality is better than the golden arches or equivalents but is lot more expensive. We took packed lunches in with us.Evening Dining   There are several restaurants in the Parks and more outside in the Village, which is located 8mins at slow pace from gates. However you are expecting a Wetherspoons or Harvester priced dining experiences then you will find these restaurants very expensive. However if you enjoy dining out as a family and enjoy high quality Gastro food then actually we felt these restaurants were only 5 10% above what you would pay at home for the equivalent.  Adult Set Menus from 26 euros per head for 3 courses. Would recommend both Billy Bobs and the steakhouse in the Village complex.Our 6 year old has a healthy appetite, the l'enfant menus were on the light side sometimes and we needed to top him afterwards.TOP TIP   Booking to eat   Seems to be a must, yet the restaurants never seem to be full. What you are not told is you can go to any of the main restaurants and staff,should you get a helpful one !! can book you a table at all eateries inside the park and outside in the village. Parking   We stayed offsite and drove to the park each day. We followed signs to the main Parking and paid 15 euros a day. If you follow signs to the Village Parking you can pay by the duration of the stay   meaning a day could cost just 7.50 euros. Please note actually this parking is nearer to the Park entrances !!!!   could be cost effective if you have tired little ones !!Duration in the Park   1day in each park was plenty mind you we did find ourselves there from 10am to 9.30pm.Down Side   Customer Service at ticket booths, main gates and front of house in the main restaurants all leave a lot to be desired... Expect Rudeness, very little eye contract and general ly uninterested staff. On the flip side though, ride staff polite enough and once you have your table in a restaurant service is very good.",Disneyland_Paris

Spend the money on a DisneyBus (Transfers from Paris Proper) and it's a stress free trip to and from Disneyland Paris.

128261270,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"While we personally like the rides in the Studios best, this is where younger children are likely to want to spend most of their time   especially Fantasy Land. Not to be missed are Buzz Lightyear's laser blast which is an interactive ride where you get to use lasers to hit targets and get an individual score. Thunder Mountain is also not to be missed. If you go this year, make sure you are able to stay to the end, however tired and whatever the weather, as the Disney Dreams show is the most amazing spectacular we've ever seen. I won't spoil it by putting any details on here, but it really is not to be missed. Even if you have to stand for an hour in the rain to find a good spot like we did! If you have younger children who aren't usually in a pram, it would be worth hiring one if they tire easily as over the two parks during the day we walked 22km! We stayed overnight the day before, but travelled back to England on the Eurotunnel after the day at Disney. This was extremely tiring and I would recommend a second overnight stay if possible, although this does add to the expense. We booked everything ourselves and didn't stay at one of the main Disney hotels this time and it worked out much more reasonable than booking one of the packages, but 4 years ago we got a very good deal so it's worth shopping around for the best deal for each individual family, couple or group. An amazing experience.",Disneyland_Paris

I can tell you now it'll be the best thing you do, it's amazing. Me and my boyfriend are 22 and 21 and still found it amazing you walk into the park and turn into a 8 year old again. If you stay in the Disney hotels you get 2 extra hours in the Disneyland park and we managed to do all the rides pretty much in an hour so make use of this time to ride the bigger rides like space mountain 2. We booked the half board option I would also advise doing this as buffet prices are on average ea out 40euro per adult in the park which is pretty steep. Also book the restaurants in the town hall in the park when you arrive. It is sooooooooooo good I cannot explain. Also make sure you stay at the park cos around 9.45pm they have the laser show on the castle which should not be missed. Enjoy your visit!!",Disneyland_Paris
128224270,3,2012-4,United Kingdom,We went with our 18month old daughter and it wasn't what I expected at all! The Disney characters do not walk around for you to meet like we thought you have to pay extra to meet them for breakfast which just felt like another chance for Disney to make money! There are good rides but the waits are lengthy and to be honest it just seemed like a huge shop...they are everywhere and overpriced along with the awful food. We paid 34 euros for two cheeseburger meals and 6 chicken nuggets! The park itself is well kept and lovely but for the cost of the tickets (74 euros per adult and 66 per child) plus the parking and extras on the day I'm afraid for us it really wasn't worth it!,Disneyland_Paris

We did it the wrong way round and were a bit disappointed with certain aspects. That said the kids still loved it. You will need a full day to visit it, do not try and visit the Disney Studios next door as that needs a full day as well. If you only have 1 day and your kids are 8  then visit Disney Studios. We visited it mid week just before Easter and was surprised by how quite(ish) it was. Q's were okay BUT this meant that lots of food snack coffee stands were closed which was a bit annoying. Tip for 1st time visits.  to beat the q's USE FAST PASS  If you don't know what it is, read the map they give you at the gate.PS. Dont forget this is Disney so EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE!

128192975,4,2012-3,United Kingdom,"Spent a lot of time before we went reading reviews and forum and was quite worried by all the negative reviews BUT we had the most fantastic time. This was our first time in Disneyland Paris. Travelled March 2012, 4 days and 3 nights in Hotel New York with 3 and 6 year old. This was just right amount of time, as we got to do most of the things we wanted to do.Biggest letdown of the whole trip was VEA disneybus from CDG. We couldn't get on the first bus that came, there seemed to be seats on the bus but no room for cases. Don't expect any help putting cases on the bus from staff. Waited an age for next bus. We lost at least 2 hours waiting around and then sitting on bus. Will book private transfer next time. Both studios and disneyland park were really busy and the queues on Saturday especially were very long, but even our kids didn't mind as you're constantly moving and quite often have something to look at as you walk. Didn't encounter anyone trying to push in, although some teenage boys seemed to have no concept of personal space in the queues! The rides are BRILLIANT, although I was disappointed with Pirates of the Carribean (my 6 year old loved it). My favourite (and my 6 yr old daughter's) favourite was Thunder Mountain. Buzz Lightyear and Tower of Terror are also fantastic. The baby switch on the rides is brilliant   ask for a baby switch ticket before you get on the ride, the other person can then go on the ride without having to queue again. And the ticket is for two people, so our 6 year old got to go on a lot of the rides twice.Both the parks are lovely, really clean, staff were friendly. I was surprised how magical it all seemed. Food and drinks are very expensive. We had a massive breakfast at the hotel, and made up sandwiches which we took into the parks (take sandwich bags), and so we only needed to worry about evening meals. We had dinner at Inventions and did Princess meal. Both are VERY expensive but the food was lovely and the girls got characters coming to our table and interacting with them. This meant we didn't have to spend any time in the parks queueing to meet characters. Was so worth the expense to see my daughters' reactions.Be organised, expect aching feet, take hire a buggy for kids under 4 or even 5, use Fast pass and have a brilliant time. Oh, and arrange another holiday for when you get home as you'll all be exhausted!",Disneyland_Paris

128111552,2,2012-3,Spain,"Such a disappointment. The parks look great. The rides are superb. Everything else falls well below the standard you'd expect from Disney. We went to the park mid week, and immediately noticed that most of the restaurants were closed, even the theme restaurants where we'd hoped to have dinner (Buffalo Bills). The restaurants which were open were shockingly overpriced and the food was horrific, the staff were rude and discourteous. At a Disney Park, you expect to meet and see Disney characters (if you've been to Florida you'll know that you can bump into Mickey or Donald as you wander around). There were none, with the exception of the parade later in the day there was not a single character in sight. Such a disappointment.My impression of Disnleyland Paris is that a fantastic American concept has been brought to France, and sadly the French just aren't up to the job of making people happy and delivering the Disney experience. When we went, it just felt like they couldn't really be bothered.",Disneyland_Paris
128105918,5,2012-3,United Kingdom,"We had a great time at Disneyland Paris. There was myself, my wife and our 6 year old little girl. We also went along with my brothers family. We went on a Thursday am from Manchester Airport and Checked in to the Newport bay Hotel approx. 2pm. From then we went straight to the Parks. The date was the end of March 2012 at the start of the 20th year celebrations. The parks were not as busy on the Thursday and Friday, these are good days to get on lots of rides. The weekend became very busy indeed and the rides difficult to get on.We would recommend you use the fast pass system for certain rides as we found this worked well.The Newport Bay hotel was very busy, however well organised and clean and comfortable. The walk to the parks was only 10 minutes past the lake.A great holiday with lots of fun, wear comfortable walking shoes to get round the parks.",Disneyland_Paris

128048938,2,2012-4,United Kingdom,"Can't say that I hugely loved this theme park. The ratio of time spent queuing to time on an enjoyable ride is approximately 14:1. When you do get on a ride it's actually quite enjoyable but the whole experience is marred by the overwhelming and prevailing number of queues, all of which are extraordinarily lengthy in the extreme. I found myself leaving the park early just to avoid having to stand in any more queues. You even queue up for ages in each and every eatery and in every shop.Also not the best place to spend any time unless you enjoy beng surrounded by prefabricated artificiality and a baffling level of quotidian teddy bears.",Disneyland_Paris
128046881,4,2012-4,Belgium,"Everything is professional, charming and well maintained. There seem to be almost as many staff as visitors and the whole site is impeccably clean. Yes it was cold and windy but none of our party cared because the queues were short and we spent most of our time on rides, which was frankly unexpected.",Disneyland_Paris
127994659,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,i really love this place   the rides are fantastic and the kids had a ball   please be aware that height restrictions apply to some of the bigger rides so don't do what i did and promise the kids a ride that they were too short for lol.I know the park is in France but it would be really great if at least some of the staff spoke with an american accent   kids quite confused as they heard Micky Mouse on the telly speaking english but when they met him at the park he spoke French!!!All in all had a wonderful day and would revisit in a heartbeat,Disneyland_Paris
127978324,3,2012-3,United Kingdom,"We travelled with our 2 children their partners and 4 grandchildren aged 5,6,7 and 13. Our visit was the week before the celebrations for being open for 20 years. I was surprised how much was unfinished, and how much had not change since my visit in 1995! The small children were very patient waiting in long queues for rides. Despite it not being the school holidays, it was very busy. Probably due to the lovely unseasonal weather. We booked a package and stayed at The Newport Bay Hotel. This allowed us access 2 hours before the park opened to the public. Great, but only a small number of rides were actually open at this time, so after the second day there seemed little point in rushing to get there early. The entrance price represents good value for money, but once inside the parks everything we bought was expensive! This was a once in a lifetime trip, as 3 of the boys live in Australia, so it would have been mean not to allow them a momento each! I had read on Tripadvisor that you were not allowed to take drinks and food into the parks. I took my rucksack anyway, and was glad I did. Although all bags went through an airport type scanner at the entrance to the parks and Disney village, I did not see anyone having food drink confiscated, and my bottles of drink were never questioned. The height restrictions on some rides were not consistant. The ride based on 'Finding Nemo' was open to the 5 year old   it was by far the scariest ride I went on! Infact he did say it had 'upset his Disney holiday'! Whereas the 'Indiana Jones' ride excluded the 3 youngest children, and really wasn't frightening, as you were so well secured in your seat. I had also read that there were not many characters about, and that they were not very friendly   I am sure we saw most of them at least twice. The children had their photos taken with them, including Mickey, and they were very accommodating to allow combinations of children in each photo. Considering that there was an 'offical' photographer there, I thought this was very generous.",Disneyland_Paris
127977101,5,2011-5,Egypt,"This is a full day trip, highly recommended to visit the studios park also, if you have kids, start with the Disneyland park, if you are group of adults definitely start with the studios, all the adults games are there , but you have to visit both, Try to stay away from the weekends and the holidays.Another tip, don't leave a game and say I'll come later because it's crowded, it will only get more crowded with time.For the tickets you can find good deals for it in Auchun hyper market, just ask for the deals, also buy the souvenirs from the Disney shop next to the parks, it's much bigger with more varieties than that in the Champs Elysee.Finally must visit and don't plan any visits with it as it will take you all the day, go early :)",Disneyland_Paris
127970071,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"This is my first trip advisor review feeling compelled to give some hints and tips after reading lots of good advice from users prior to our recent Disneyland visit.We have literally just got back and it was a fantastic experience. Stayed in Sequoia Lodge for 4 nights after the easter weekend. You will have read a lot of repeated advice already but here are my top tips:1)   ABOVE ALL ELSE, SEE THE LIGHT SHOW (sorry to shout). It started at about 9:30pm last week and lasts about 20 mins I think (although I lost track of time!). It is an absolute triumph for Disney. Just superb and wonderful. I like my special effects movies and can honestly say I have never seen anything to match this show. Just put your camera down and let it wash over you. You'll have tears in your eyes. I'm not gonna spoil it for you.2) Breakfast gets a bit samey but you are trapped!   Not a big fan of the breakfast I'm afraid...just found my self yearning for something hot after the first few days (didn't like the french 'sweet' white bread so couldn't even have hot toast). I mean Disney is hard work and you need a big breakfast! On the last day we thought we'd give it a miss and eat at McDonalds. Unfortunately McDonalds in the Village doesn't open for breakfast!!! Ended up having to wait until the restaurants opened at about 11AM for lunch. Big mistake.3) Bring lots of snacks with you (tracker bars crisps apples) to save on lunch which is indeed expensive. A fast food lunch for 4 is gonna set you back 40 50 Euros (a chicken burger meal is about 11 euros alone and and Angus meal about 14 euros). Bottle of soft drink is about 3 euros in the park so make up some squash. Don't waste your time making up those little rolls and smuggling 'em out of breakfast...you do feel a bit naughty! If you have to, grab a couple of Pain Au Chocolats!4) Check out the shows   They are very good, you don't have to queue much and they last a lot longer than a rides. Animagique is nicely done, Cinemagique is fun and Moteurs is superb. Avoid the 'art of disney'...the worst thing in the park IMO (OK if you speak French though). Armageddon is also a bit rubbish so avoid if there is a queue.5) Use the early 8AM start if you are staying at a disney hotel (some days it's the Studios Park but mostly it's Disneyland Park). The park looks so different when it's nearly empty. It's great walking on big rides without queuing too! Be aware though that only certain rides will be open (they give you a list when you arrive). Frontierland didn't open until 10AM and was roped off. Not sure if this is standard or if they rotate the roped off land. 6) Some rides open before 10. Even though Disney Studios didn't officially open until 10, they do let people (if you are in a disney hotel that is) in earlier and some rides start at 9:30! If you arrive at 10AM the ride may have started and there may already be a big queue. This happened with Crush's Coaster ride. 7) Autopia   This is very popular. However, as I mentioned above, some rides are opened early and this is one of them. Start queuing at 9:15. Be at the front. They'll open it at 9:30 and you have only queued 15 mins!8) Buffalo Bills   Good evening and don't listen to the detractors, there is plenty of food (cake small bowl of chilli sausage, chicken leg, 2 big ribs, potatoes) and I had my half pint filled up 3 4 times...which is fine for a 1.5 hour show.9) Use fast passes   The system isn't always the same though. Sometimes the fast passers 'merge' with the main queue (e.g. for indiana Jones ride and Buzz Lightyear) For others there is a separate queue e.g. Thunder Mountain and Star Tours. The Star Tours fast pass works best...almost straight on the ride.10) Pirates of the Caribbean ride is really good and generally has short sues. Always good if you need a time filler whilst waiting for your Fast Pass time to come up! Phantom Manor was also one of the quieter rides.11) Yes food is expensive but don't get hung up on it. You are going to pay about 30% more on normal prices but just build it into your budget. The buffets are better value IMO. 2 adults and 2 children can eat as much as they like for about 100 euros (including drinks). What's that...about   80? You'd pay   60 in UK perhaps. Big difference is that fast food is very expensive in Disney. We had a look in McDonalds (which may have been cheaper) in the evening but it was HEAVING! Give fast food a miss and just don't eat out for a few months when you get back to the UK!12) Videopolis is a nice place to chill out.13) Tower of Terror is actually quite frightening! Glad I did it but would rather ride Space Mountain....as that's a bit less scary..and that's saying something! It's a dropping from height thing!14) The parades like all things in the park are top quality. Get a good spot 30 mins before the start at least. 15) There's a handy shortcut between fantasy land and discovery land (not open at parade times as that's when they start from).16) Sequoia Lodge had characters turn up for photos with kids at about 7:45 onwards. And there was no one around at that time! It also has a really nice pool with a small flume and spa (changing rooms showers are provided so no need to turn up in your trunks!)17) SEE THE LIGHT SHOW!Have a great time! We did.",Disneyland_Paris
127945439,2,2011-12,United Kingdom,"We have visited Disneyland Paris a few times now, but sadly our most recent visit will be our last.The park felt dated and shabby, the staff didn't seem to want to be there and it's horrendously expensive, even for an awful cup of tea. If you visit my advice would be to take a flask and your own food into the park for lunch. There is a very good Auchan supermarket 5 mins away at Val d'europe shopping centre. The bus or train will take you there. It will save you a lot of money. I think the biggest disappointment this time was the meet the Princesses attraction next to 'it's a small world'. My daughter adores all the Disney Princesses and we decided on our last day to meet them all (or so we thought). The attraction opens at 10am but we started to queue at 9.30 and at this time there was already a huge queue, we should have been waiting at 9am. When the doors opened at 10am we had another wait for over an hour. When we were finally at the front of the queue, we were told that there were 2 princesses there behind a screen but we could only see one princess and in our case it would be Aurora. We weren't given a choice. If we wanted to see another princess we would have to queue again (at least another hour and a half!) and there were no guarantees as to who that would be. My daughter was so upset as we expected to see lots of princesses. We were ushered in to see Aurora for all of 1  2 minutes and a professional Disney photographer took photos, we were then told to leave where they then try to sell you the pictures which are incredibly expensive. So beware and take your own camera with a flash! This is just one example of the many ways Disney try to exploit you as parents, they really don't care about the feelings of your little ones. To watch my daughter go from excited to crestfallen was horrible.",Disneyland_Paris
127905288,5,2012-4,Serbia,"Just got back and it was really beautifull. We have three sons (10 and 7 years and 11 month baby) and they all had great time (even baby, he could sleep in the stroller while the rest of us enjoyed the rides). There are simple rides (carousels) and more exciting rides (roller coasters), try everything.I suppose you can be confused if you visit Disneyland for only one day. I recommend to spend at least three days in Disneyland: two in the Park and one in the Studio. You should prepare (best on http:  www.dlrpmagic.com ) and get familiar with the possible rides and sites before you go.Use fastpass   in the morning first take fastpass for certain rides: Peter Pan (in Park), Buzz Laser (Park), Tower of Terror (Studios), Rock and Roller Coaster (Studios)... and then enjoy less busy rides and shopping while waiting.The food is not cheap but I guess it is not that expensive to pay 10 euros for a meal in various fast food restaurants. You can bring in sandwiches, water... there is a little shop in the train station just in front of the entry to the park. And one final remark: the experience of waiting in the lines was not that bad as we feared. The line is always moving, and you have always something to distract your attention. We even didin't need our PSP in the lines because kids didn't complain about anything. Everything is perfectly organized and everybody is waiting patiently in the line, nobody is nervous or aggressive.So expect only the best and enjoy",Disneyland_Paris
127868974,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"We were very pleasantly suprised by Disneyland Paris, it was excellent fun having quite low expectations before arriving. For all the rides and shows the ticket prices represent great value for money. However beware of the food, it is an appalling representation of French cuisine and way overpriced. If you don't want the the onset of early diabetes and be bankrupt before year end take your own food and drinks. The other issue is no policing of smokers, whom seem to light up wherever they please (including queues) with complete disregard for theirs or others health or safety. There are designated smoking areas, but you would never know it.",Disneyland_Paris

Tip   if you want to see the princesses, get there early as the queue is long, but worth it! My daughter's favourite Princess is Rapunzel and she was lucky enough to go see her too. There are 2 princesses in different rooms and you get to see 1 only   no choice. The rides are fantastic and there is something for everyone.

There is adequate security which means there is less room for theft and good facilities to manage the huge crowd.Its better to visit Disneyland on a weekday. I went on a weekend and there was a flood of people. The number only increased by each hour. After being there from 10 am till 7 in the evening, I could not cover all attractions in the park because of time spent in the queue. But visiting on a weekday will allow you to enjoy all attractions in a day.There are not too many options for food though.

127684804,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"I have just come back from a five day break in France. There were two adults and four children in our party, the children were aged 15, 9, 6 and 4. We had a four day hooper ticket for both parks. I found that the four days were ample time for both parks. There was a full range of rides from the gentle ones for the little ones to the more scary rides for the rest of the party. We did have to queue for a while for some of the rides (Great tip: get the little ones to go to the toilet before joining a long queue!) but some of the most popular rides had fast track tickets available which is well worth it. This doesn't cost you anything and gives you a particular time to go back to your ride, in which time you could queue for another ride, saving you lots of time!Both Disney parks were very clean and the employees there were all very friendly and helpful.There is so much to do make sure you pick up your map and programme when you enter the parks so you can plan your day.Food is quite expensive here, but we had done our research before and had prepared by taking loads of snacks that we could eat during the day and only had to worry about an evening meal.There is a shop just inside the train station that sale sandwiches and a reasonable price.We all came back very tired but all really enjoyed our Disney experience.Don't miss the parades you need to see at least one! Magical!We stayed just outside the Disney parks but the hotel put on a free shuttle bus which took 2 minutes to get to Disney. The shuttle buses ran every 10 15 minutes so you were not waiting long should you miss one. The shuttle buses could get quite packed on your return journey back to your hotel but you only had to stand for a couple of minutes so wasn't a problem.",Disneyland_Paris

I have been to better theme parks in the Uk and at a fraction of the cost. The parade at the end of the day was fantastic but we never saw any characters walking around the park the rest of the time like we expected. Food and drink at the park was ridiculasly expensive so we bought our own from the train station before we entered and it saved us a lot of money.The queuing system is an absolute joke as  alot  of people don't seem to know how to queue!

127654580,5,2012-4,United States,The parade is at 5:00 pm and we missed it. It only lasts about 20 minutes or so. The fireworks are much smaller than the ones in FL. Make sure you bring planty of snacks and water as the prices in the park are super high and offer very little value.,Disneyland_Paris
127650403,4,2012-3,United Kingdom,"I went to Disneyland Paris with my daughter who is 5. We also went with 3 adult friends and 2 of their daughters both aged 4. We went tues friday. The Park was beautiful, spotless and the rides were fantastic for children in our group. We watched the parade on our first day around 5pm, and it was fantastic. I would recommend that you find a spot to watch the parade about 20 mins before its starts to get a good view. The staff were very friendly helpful in the park. The food availiable in the park is mainly fast food i.e hotdogs, burgers chips. and is expensive. I brought drinks and snacks from home to keep us topped up cheaply! The queues were long as expected, so try to use fast track where possible. We were staying in a disney hotel so got extra 2 hours in the park before it opened, if you have this option use it, definatly worth it. The park really goes quite at 5.30pm after the parade worth making the most of this, queues go right down.  We booked to have a meal with the characters, well worth it. The kids loved it, the characters were fantastic, playing with the kids, chasing them round. Brilliant!. We were dissapointed on the last day. As we arrived at the park there was a protest going on around the park,they were loud and very disruptive and frightened my little girl. This resulted in the parade being cancelled which really spoilt our last day. Despite the protest we had a great time and my daughter didn't want to come home!!",Disneyland_Paris
127649693,3,2012-4,United Kingdom,"This was our third visit to Disneyland Paris and will most probably be our last.If you've never been to Florida then I guess you will find it quite good, however if you have been to DisneyWorld then it's somewhat of a disappointment. The magic just doesn't seem to be there!Right from the word go, the queues were horrendous, and that started with the bag check! Everyone had to go through it regardless of whether they had a bag or not. Then there were queues for tickets before queueing to get through the turnstiles. When it got to the attractions the majority of the queues were a minimum of 45 mins. Even the toilets had long queues.The food we had was expensive and cold. The set menus were really restrictive in that you could only have soda to drink and not have a hot, sorry, luke warm drink in it's place. If you did want to exchange the drink then you had to buy the sandwich, fries and drink separately making it even more expensive!The park is also advertising how it's the 20th Anniversary and what a wonderful celebration there is going on. Other than a few number  20 s on the parade floats and by the main entrance, it wasn't as apparent or as obvious as I thought it would have been. In all honesty if I hadn't seen the adverts, I would have struggled to have told you that there was anything special happening at all. The park was supposed to close at 22:30 but by 19:00 certain areas could be seen to be shutting down with the food vendors and restaurants closed.Thankfully, it started to rain so that gave us the confirmation we needed that it was time to leave.On the plus side, the Big Thunder Mountain coaster is way better than the one in Florida!

127603451,3,2012-4,United Kingdom,"I visited with my mother in law and two children, aged 6 and 5. We had 2 day, 2 park passes.If you are arriving first thing in the morning, expect it to take you between 60 90 minutes to get in, if you come by road. There is a 30 minute walk from the car park to the Disney Village. You will then need to queue to have your bag scanned, around 15 minutes. Then you walk through the gardens and queue to get through the turnstiles     another 20 30 minutes before you finally get into the park.You can hire pushchairs for around 10 euros for the day, which are transferrable between the two parks.Do make use of the Fastpass system. It will make a huge difference to how smoothly your day runs! It doesn   t cost anything     simply insert your park ticket into the machine and it will print you off a Fastpass tickets and tell you when to return. If you have a Fastpass ticket, it will take you pretty much straight into the loading area (unlike at some English theme parks, where you can still have a 20 30 minute queue). Without a Fastpass, expect to queue for around 60 75 minutes per ride, across the board (not just the famous popular ones).There are nowhere near enough facilities to accommodate the number of visitors to the park. There are approximately two sets of toilets in each of the    lands   , the main areas. There is almost no signage anywhere in the parks. A map is ESSENTIAL, otherwise you will never find the toilets, which are hidden in nooks and crannies in some peculiar places. Expect it to take you ten minutes to reach and locate the toilets, and then another 20 30 minutes to queue (if you are a woman). Should your child have an accident, you   ll be very hard pushed to find underwear and trousers to buy, so do be prepared.There are also nowhere near enough tables and chairs in the    eateries   . Expect to wait a long time if you   re looking for a table. The general    restaurants    have a very limited menu. Expect to have a choice of a chicken burger and chips meal, a fish and chips meal or a kids meal with nuggets as the full range of your options. We had two children   s meals with nuggets, one fish and chips meal and one chicken burger and chips meal, and it came to OVER 50 EUROS. There are a very few    proper    restaurants, at which you can book a table. They offer a set menu, and you can expect these to range from 35 65 euros PER PERSON. My advice would be to find a local supermarket and buy some sandwiches make a packed lunch and some drinks to take with you. Two coffees and two cokes will typically cost you around 15 euros.The staff all speak English, and give you a very strange expression if you speak to them in French. They are helpful.Check for the times of parades as they are not always the same each day. I would recommend, if you have children, watch the parade from the entrance end of the parade route, so that the parade reaches you last. Towards the end of the parade, they move the ropes so that people can follow the parade down, and if you have been waiting at the ropes, adults will indiscriminately trample and crush children to get their video footage, with no care or regard whatsoever. I   m amazed that they are allowed to move the ropes in that way, with no supervision, as mine were not the only children who got hurt. So, at the very end of the parade route, where the ropes don   t get moved is definitely the safest place for little ones.We went over Easter, and there are still a fair number of attractions closed or boarded up. There are few characters for the children to meet, and they are not often in the places indicated by the map. We only found one character in two days!The weather will have a big influence on the enjoyment of your day, as there is nowhere to go to get out of the rain, for example. If in doubt, wrap up warm!",Disneyland_Paris
127585131,3,2012-4,Belgium,Over the easter weekend there were far too many closed attractions (maintenance and technical problems). The food is terrible for the price you pay.

We had been in March April previously and there wasn't anything special going on so it was relativley quiet in comparison.

We spent most out times in Fantasyland since many of the rides for small children are her, and the Princesses! We stayed only for a day, and felt that it was enough. Took the RER to and from the park, convinient since we stayed in Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
127451915,4,2012-4,United Kingdom,"I travel regularly to Disneyland Paris as I have an autistic son obsessed with  Its a small world.  This visit, I have noticed a huge clampdown on the  priority access  for disabled guests throughout the park and a sneering attitude from some of the cast members on boarding the rides. I do appreciate, and often feel guilty, that there are many disabled folk in the park and it is unfair that those queuing have to be sidelined in favour of the disabled, but the new policy has to be questioned. On arriving at Pirates of the Caribbean, there were two other groups with a disabled party member in front. The female boarding was quite abrupt in dealing with us and told us we would have to wait for the two other parties to ride first   and that would be a 30 minute wait. Meanwhile a French woman and child arrived behind us in line and when the first disabled group boarded, the French woman was put on with her child as well. Bizarre I thought! Then whilst we were waiting the normal line was boarding rapidly to the point that there were boats leaving that were half empty. Clearly we could have boarded with these, but instead we were told to wait. We counted at least a dozen boats sailing into the pirate zone that had rows left empty, whilst we sat on. Meanwhile, the queue for disabled boarding was starting to build up. My son loves this park, and we will no doubt return, but there needs to be a degree of flexibility amongst cast members   or DLP park policy to make their rides more efficient.",Disneyland_Paris

127369624,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"Went to Disneyland Paris at the start of the 20th anniversary celebrations. We went with our 2 grandchildren. Aged 9 and 5 they had a fantastic time. We went to Disney on the Eurostar and used the Disney express a really great service we just left our luggage and it was taken to our Hotel we stayed at the Santa Fe which we found very clean and tidy it had all we needed after all you are only sleeping there as you are in the parks all day we had adjoining rooms. The towels and bedding were changed every day and soap and shower gel replenished. Breakfast was very busy but plenty of tables a continental breakfast we made up rolls to take with us for lunch a lot of people were doing the same. Food in the parks is very expensive. The fireworks and light show was fantastic we fast tracked a lot of rides as the queues were very long all in all a fantastic few days and recommend it, we have been to both the Florida and California parks and is up there with them although a lot smaller.",Disneyland_Paris

We went at Christmas and it really was amazing there were the most gorgeous Christmas trees and decorations Christmas music Santa Claus and even snow!!! However it was freezing so be sure to wrap up especially at night time! Ques wasn't too long don't think we waited over half an hour for a ride and that was only a few times...was very strange hearing characters voices in French lol but in most cases they have an English version or someway of understanding it. Most staff here were nice however it is Disney thought they'd be a bit more happy and cheery and get into the magical feel of it but some looked bored and like they should not be working at disney!!! Something's are a bit pricey but its the same at any disney or even any big attraction and you get what you pay for and it's all so worth it...we made lots of magical memories here and cannot wait to go back this Christmas to make lots more!,Disneyland_Paris

Lots to see and do but a lot of walking too so be prepared for that!!Characters around all day so make sure you look out for them (get a photo with them or their autograph too). At the end of the day (5pm), watch the parade go by.As expected, food and merchandise is VERY expensive.Go on the train which runs aorund the park .. BUT .. dont get the train at the entrance station as that is the busiest one and you queue for ages. You are better off getting the train at one of the other stops where the queues are minimal.Gets a lot quieter after the parade when most people head home.",Disneyland_Paris
127278366,2,2012-2,Belgium,I think they are aiming on a single french speaking audience because of the poor language skills and lack of friendliness of the staff. Only some Belgian and Dutch student workers could meet the standards.It's a pity to see such a park in hands of the Parisian mentality.Also this is by far the worst maintained parks of the Disney group.,Disneyland_Paris
127265175,4,2012-3,United States,"My daughter and I have been to DisneyWorld and Disneyland too many times to count. Since we were in Paris, we wanted to see what the Disneyland Paris park was like. We took the RER train which was located in the metro right in front of the Opera Garnier. I would recommend purchasing roundtrip tickets at the information booth. Follow the signs to make sure you take the correct train. Your ending point is Marne la Vallee Chessy. It will be a 40 minute train trip and the stop puts you right by Disneyland. We purchased the Disney tickets online before we left for the trip. I believe both parks cost $62 each. We first went to Walt Disney Studios and was shocked as to how small it is. Since we read the reviews about Crush's Coaster, we went there first and stood in line for 50 minutes. People raved about the ride but when we walked out we had no clue why people liked it. For the first 10 seconds, there is animation about the undersea life and then everything is dark and it is a rollercoaster ride for the rest of the time. It is definitely not worth the wait in line. We took the Studio Tram Tour which is similar to the Backstage Lot at Disney. I really liked the French version which had a French English story about a traveler losing his cellphone and ends up in all these movies. Cinemagique was for a younger audience. Several of the restaurants at both parks were closed which I found to be very odd. We had a salad in the entrance. At the main park, we went to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril. It was disappointing to find out that it is a roller coaster and at the end does a complete tight 360. Pirates of the Caribbean was closed. It is good to check online which rides are closed. The Phantom Manor was much the same as the one in Disney as was Big Thunder Mountain. It's a Small World is much better in Paris than in the U.S. Star Tours and Buzz Lightyear were about the same as the ones in the U.S. Space Mountain was much more adventuresome than the one at DisneyWorld. I can tolerate the one there but not being a fan of roller coasters I thought this one was too much for me. The happy go lucky and cheery feeling just wasn't evident at this park. In the U.S. the employees are fun, greet people and seem like Disney ambassadors. There are no 1st time, birthday buttons either which I think is a great touch. I am glad I went once but I wouldn't be interested in going back. We went on a Thursday and at the main park we waited about 5 15 minutes for each ride.",Disneyland_Paris
127263725,5,2012-4,United Kingdom,"We enjoyed a fantastic day right at the start of the 20th anniversary celebrations. The park was busy, but fast passes were available and waiting was not too long. It was possible to get on most of the big rides quite easily. Space Mountain, Star Tours, Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean all provided thrills and great enjoyment. The theming is wonderful and the walks aren't too far to get from land to land. Food, however, is pricey and not very varied. Shopping choice is excellent with quality souvenirs for every pocket. The parade was lovely and really added to the ambiance. With the sun shining, you could almost believe you are in the US, the home of Disney. We wished we could have returned the next day.",Disneyland_Paris
127263071,3,2012-4,United States,"I go to Disneyland in California at least once a year, so I'm a fan. I decided that I wanted to check out Disneyland Paris  and it isn't bad, it's just not the original. First, it's lacking the magic...you don't see characters and the cast members aren't terribly friendly (although the one at city hall was very helpful). I had on an official  happy birthday  sticker since it was my birthday on my visit (note: it's a sticker and not a pin like in Cali) and only one cast member gave me birthday wishes. I was there on a Wednesday in April, slightly cool and cloudy. Pretty crowded though. There were defiantly not enough workers at the cashier stations. Lines were hit or miss. 5 minutes at the Phantom Mansion and Pirates, but 40  at Big Thunder and Peter Pan.The park is much more tightly laid out than Cali, so you feel a bit squashed. It was fun to see differences in the rides and talk with the French pirates (no captain Jack though). So, if you are a big fan of the parks and want to see the difference, give it a go (I spent about 4 hours total) it's expensive, but it was my vacation right? If you are hauling kids who've already done Disney, I'd say skip it",Disneyland_Paris
127260177,4,2012-4,United Kingdom,"Absolutey brilliant day out, lots to do for everybody. Definitely needed a couple of days to attempt to do it justice.The downside is the food ordering system. You queue to pay, there is one cashier for two queues, they process the queue by serving each side alternately. You are issued with a ticket AND THEN you join another queue for the food. All in all it took well over an hour, I dread to think how long it would be in the height of season. The staff were working their socks off and were very helpful, it was the system that was dire.",Disneyland_Paris
127154837,3,2012-3,United Kingdom,"Firstly, Cold. Then again why build a Disney park in Northern Europe! Just not as magical as I expected. Queues were too long (especially in the cold).

127134343,3,2012-3,United Kingdom,Amazing place given the scale and rides. Constant shops and queues (worst 1.5 hours to meet a princess   and we cant tell you which one) a bore.

127110048,5,2012-3,Spain,"There was loads to do in this park, the different areas make it easier to find the rides and things to do.

I booked hotel DLP hotel shuttle with Prestige Transfer and that was well worth the $. We left our Paris hotel at 8:30am and left Disneyland at 8:30pm, which for us was perfect. The park feels quite different than the other Disney parks. For instance, no characters walk around, very few kids are wearing Disney ears, and there are fewer venders. The castle and grounds are beautiful, however. I would highly recommend hitting the park. Ignore the people who look at you aghast when you mention DLP.

The most we que'd was 20mins for any ride   except to meet a princess   which was an hour!!! Don't bother with Captain EO   very dated 3D of Michael Jackson. By the saturday, it took us 40mins to just get through security before the gates to the park   it seems very to be an oversight by the park to only have 4 people checking bags, when thousands of people want to get in. By the weekend we waited an hour to go on Pirates of the caribbean. Take plenty of snacks and drinks with you, unless you're rich!Fronteirland was a bit of a dissapointment as thunder mountain and river boat closed, so not really anything else to do there. Watch the parade from near the park entrance if you don't want to que to get out after the parade.

127027185,3,2012-3,United Kingdom,"My family love Disneyland Paris, we have been visiting it for the last ten years and have always had a blast. This time however, our expectations were not met. The Disneyland Hotel was as enjoyable as ever, but we had several issues in the park and in Disney Village. On booking, we were warned that Thunder Mountain was closed, so we expected that and although disappointed still went ahead with our booking. However, we would not have gone at this time if we had been warned about the rest of the closures of restaurants lack of parades and shows in comparison to other times and restricted openings of several other attractions. All of this combined to ensure much longer queue times for rides and restaurants at a time of the year when you do not expect to have to wait so long. We had spent so much money getting there, we made sure we made the best of it and still enjoyed ourselves to a point, but it is the first time we have gone when we have seriously doubted if we will ever be back. It costs so much that Disney really need to ensure that everyone goes away satisfied. It is clear that money has been invested in Walt Disney Studios, the main park now needs to have some serious investment in new rides and attractions   some are starting to look very dated.Do not bother to eat at Planet Holywood or Billy Bob's Buffet in Disney Village   service and food both disgusting. Cafe Mickey is definitely the way to go!",Disneyland_Paris
127003422,3,2012-3,United Kingdom,"I have just come back from  Dance Camp  (includes sing camp) at Euro Disney. While I cant fault Disney itself I have to say that EVERYTHING was so overpriced. We were paying (in euros) 4.30 for a bottle of diet coke, 2.50 for a 500ml bottle of water and around 12.99 for burger & chips. A pint of lager in the Thomas Cook Explorer hotel was 6.90. While I accept that you are going to pay more than the norm for goods when you are  trapped  in a resort these price are disgustingly high.The hotel was adequate (like a travel lodge with a theme). Different bars were open at different times but through the day it is almost impossible to get anything to eat or drink. The rooms were clean. which I am fussy about, and maid service was everyday.Overall Disney was OK (for kids of the right age) but remember to take a large wad of cash.",Disneyland_Paris
127002305,5,2011-7,North Macedonia,"We were in Disney July 2011 and also July 2010.The Park was excellent, and we had a great time. There are 2 parks     Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studio. First of all I want to mentioned, that is impossible to go in both park in a same day. You need one day for each park, because the waiting line for raiding is too long and it takes too much time (approx 1 our waiting for some raids). I recommend to take water and juices from home (supermarket out of Disney), because there are expensive. If you can afford only one day in Disney, I highly recommended choosing a Disneyland Park. I recommend following rides (Disneyland Park): Big Thunder Mountain; Peter Pan house; Hunted House; Pirates of the Caribbean; Tee Cups; It   s a small world; Trip on the Ship; Space mountain   .Not to be missed Dream Parade     about 18:00h on the main square, also Fantillusion Parade   about 22:00h on the main square and it   s very spectacular (first time we was missed Fantillusion Parade because we are think that we will not have a time for the last train to Paris, but please note that the last train for Paris is right after Fantillusion Parade, and you will catch it for sure).These parks are fantastic I highly recommend to all.I wish you a great time and fun!",Disneyland_Paris

WDW is of course no match for any other Disney park....That said, I really enjoyed Paris! It is smaller than the other parks, but also newer. The weather was perfect (especially for March) and the park was not very crowded. The Magic Kingdom is certainly smaller than both US versions, but is about the same thing. Very slight European touches, but mostly it   s the same Disney experience.Getting there was easy. We stayed in central Paris, and took the Metro to an RER train. Very easy, and the last stop is Disney (they clearly mark it the Disney stop). The station is literally right next to the park entrance.The price was the same as all other Disney parks, and everything we bought inside was also relatively the same price as well.Everything is in English and French, so no language issues. All the rides were in English, and were standard Disney rides (i.e. Its a Small World is the same in Paris as it is in Orlando).Only negative comment...the park is not the most efficiently managed. Not sure if this is a cultural thing or not, but the staff moved a bit slow, half the rides went empty despite lines....so just be prepared for less than the perfect service found at WDW, but overall not a big deal. Overall, glad we went. It was a fun day, easy to get to from Paris, and a nice break from all the European sites we had been seeing.",Disneyland_Paris

I have visited disneyword Florida and would not say the two are on the same sheet. That said we travelled with a 6 & 4 yr old who had a great time, I think teenagers would struggle to stay amused. I really like the new York hotel althought the drinks were very expensive. Breakfast was really nice nd no long queues. The Christmas parade was wonderful and the lights and music very festive.

Cast members went above and beyond to make the day special,. The sun was shining and there were characters to meet everywhere. One cast member was ever so nice my 4 year old sister said that if she had an ice cream she would have given it to him. All of the refurbishments are amazing.

We stayed at the Santa Fe (cheapest of the Disney hotels) and found it to be an ideal base. Hotel was clean, staff friendly and the room big and clean. We upgraded to half board & it was well worth it as the resort is v.v. expensive. Breakfast was basic but provided the opportunity to make rolls to take into the park and the evening meal was great, plenty of choice   we didn't mind eating off plastic plates as when there are young children everywhere, I'd rather this than an accident invloving glass. Shuttle ran every 15 mins from right outside the hotel to the park and takes approx 3 mins. We drove to Folkestone, then caught the Eurotunnel and drove to Disney and although it was a straightforward drive, it was very tiring on the homebound journey after having a very busy weekend   there are also no signs for Disney until you have driven 2 1 2 hours so make sure you put the postcode 77700 into your satnav as soon as you get into Calais!!We didn't get to see everything suring our weekend break but still managed to have a fab time. We had to hire a buggy for my 3 year old as the amount of walking is vast but 9 euros was reasonable. You can take your own food and drink into the parks and although our bag was security checked, nothing was said and it saved us approx   100!!We will defo go back to Disneyland Paris, hopefully in December, and will stay in The Santa Fe as it's excellent value for Money. We usually pay more for luxurious holiday accomodation but what's the point in Disney when we were so tired after busy days starting at 6.30 that we were all sleeping by 10pm!!

My only real complaint is that the food quality is going down and the prices (for the park entrance and the food) are becoming astronomical. I would highly suggest planning a strategy to get the most from your day, including utilizing the fast passes when possible, and bring lots of snacks in your bags.

I am wondring that if is the ordinary status or it was due to that we were there one sunday!. Anyhow we went there in March and we were not expecting a high season crowd. I suggest you to get a Fastpass that allows you to bypass the queue in major part. Also buying ticket for two parks(Park Studio) is not logical with such a long queue.

During the day it was more like a ghost town. Staff were good, shop expensive. The Disnet parks themselves were probably getting set up for the anniversary this summer, many of the rides were3 down, maintenance was being carried out and even though some of the rides were up and running they were only on half speed, so the queue was much longer than neccessary had they used the whole of the ride. Food and drinks are expensive, drop into the local supermarket for your supplies and take it with you, or pay through the nose and have to queue into the bargain. The youngsters were tired with a lot of walking, the maps are poor and difficult to follow, if you want to see the procession get there early and pop up onto the station.

The most important thing is that a 11 and a 12 year old had the best 4 days of there lifes,so far.Stayed in a park hotel and it was what to be expected,a cattle market.People on these reviews have moaned about the park prices for food and drinks etc and they are expensive in some bars but look about, there are some who put deals on like the Sports Bar who have a kids menu and is affordable and as a tip take lots of chocolate croissants from the breakfast bar at your hotel as they shut them up during the day.lol.",Disneyland_Paris

126762236,1,2012-3,United Kingdom,"Went with my sisier and her 3 children, stayed at explorer hotel, found that disney park and studios park, that when there was queing for rides our children being pushed by other nationalities behind who seem to think that they did not have to que for their turn on the rides. Also during charcter walk a bouts, as soon as they knew English children were waiting, would turn to other euopean Children to have photos taken.My biggest complaint was at the 5pm parade i was asked by Disney park staff while waiting for aprade to start, if i was German on saying no english, i was told to move and take my children with me, which i refused as i felt my sister children had a much right to watch the parade from the front as other children, low and behold i was told to move my children again so a french family could see the parade, we did not move.I have been to disney in Florida 3 times and never experienced anything like i did in Paris, this 3 night break cost   1300, i suggest people save up a bit more and have a far better experience in florida.

I have two and both of them had an amazing time.Clippers Quay Travel advised me off the offer and not only that, they offered me 10% off Half Board options which I wasn't to keen on but I realised how much money i saved by doing this. The food out there is so expensive for me and my two nieces to eat for 1 day would of cost me about   200 WoooooooW is what i thought. I am so glad they advised me as it would of cost me sooo much.All I can say now is that I've booked again and saved even more money as they have now got 40% OFF so imagine how much you could save.

126705676,5,2012-2,United Kingdom,very good im 21 and loved every minute ! looks so real wasnt too busy ....the waiting times were about 45 mins ...but if you wait til after the parades most people leave so the rides go down to about 10 mins which is really good! also seeing everything lit up was amazing so pretty....such an easy place to get too would recommend to anyone!,Disneyland_Paris
126681102,4,2011-4,United Kingdom,This is for the kids and the adults. The kids can meet the charaters and go on the little rides. When the adults can go on the big rides. The meals there are quite pricey and sometimes you have to wait for a table.,Disneyland_Paris
126672332,4,2012-3,United Kingdom,The bag check queues took about an hour then after that was fine. Would definitely recommend going midweek as the weekend was very busy.

126646667,4,2012-3,United Kingdom,"Have been to Disney several times before but always in the summer and it's amazing. Went in March this year (first time with our children) and was very disappointed by how much was closed. It did not appear significantly quieter than previous visits, but at least 7 attractions were closed for maintenance, including 2 of the major rides (Pirates of the Carribean and Big Thunder Mountain). I appreciate that it in necessary to maintain rides, but surely this can be done one at a time.",Disneyland_Paris
126646544,2,2012-3,United Kingdom,We found that the studios tour parc was so much better for our family than the main park. The Hollywood Hotel ride was great and the studio stunts tour was really good and we sepnt a good day in that parc. The other parc aart from the wow factor of main street looking like oldie world USA the main parc was so geared towards little kids and my kids were a bit bored by it. I can not believe what people will a. queue for b. pay for. 7.50 euro for a balloon and queueing to have a photo with minnie mouse! I was very surprised that the characters were not walking around the park. My best advice is DO NOT try leaving the aprk after the 5pm parade it is a scrum and well worth sitting and waiting until it empties a bit. I do not recommend anyone with children older than 10 yrs to go here Alton towers or chessington would be far better. Pack drinks and snacks and eat them in the very long queues. The fast pass is only on a very few rides.,Disneyland_Paris

126625059,2,2012-3,United Kingdom,"Just returned from a 5 day visit to Disneyland Paris and overall enjoyed the park and the Santa Fe hotel but would advise people if they want a great magical experience at Disney to visit Florida instead. The parks were small and packed with people to the brim. Queues to enter the parks were massive due mainly to bad planning on the bag inspection area (only 2 people hand searching bags and one scanner) Queues for rides horrendous friday sat and sunday. The Disney staff were mainly friendly except for one colleague operating the Crushers Coaster ride, who did not give me time to get into the car before ripping my back pack over my head and slamming down the safety bar onto my leg causing bruising and pain for the past 5 days. On complaining to customer relations, they seemed indifferent to me and only offered pen and paper to jot down my complaint. I was not even offered a replacement popcorn, which the operator spilt over the car which had cost me 9. euros for my grandaughter. Customer service, organisation of rides and gates seriously need attention at this park. Would I go again....................probably not. Would I recomment.....................no and have my impression of the Disney company changed...............yes.save your money and time and visit Florida instead they kow how to treat people with respect!",Disneyland_Paris

That will be just   11 please sir!! We stayed in the Saqoia lodge which was well placed and purchased the half board plus which was a life saver!

126537282,2,2012-3,United Kingdom,"Maybe I am prejudiced and expected it to be as the USA.It started from parking the car, some of the travellators were not working, we then went straight to the nearest toilet facilities as we had traveled for 4 hours, not to usual Disney standard. There was building work everywhere, spoiling a lot of photo opportunities. As stated we had been informed of some ride closures, but were not told about all the full service restaurants being closed, there was maybe one open but after walking with a hungry 21 month old child to three and finding them all closed gave up the hunt, even the very helpful staff were not sure what was open. Being told that it will be much better in April for the 20th anniversary did not help at all. if the park is only going to be half open either charge 1 2 fee's or close completely do not abuse peoples love of Disney, Having traveled from the UK. had it not been for my Gran daughters face at meeting Minnie and Pooh I would have considered it a complete waste of money.",Disneyland_Paris
126534762,3,2012-3,United Kingdom,It was almost impossible to get any food as the majority of food outlets were closed. In fact we only found one open.

126533517,4,2012-3,United Kingdom,"This trip was booked via the Sun Disney deal and cost a grand total of   9.50 for a family of four inclusive of Fery and a one day pass for all 4 into Disneyland Paris. I paid an extra   43 for my Disney day ticket (via the Sun booking line) as I travelled as an 'extra' with my son and family. We travelled to Disneyland via Dover the drive was easy and took about 3 hours. (Remember that you will need 20 euros each way for tolls)We travelled as a family with two children aged 3 and 6 who absolutely loved their day at Disneyland. We arrived at the park about 9.15 and the gates were opened at 9.30 allowing entry to the park but unless you ere staying in one of the Disney Hotels and had a pass thenyou were not allowed access to the rides and attractions until 10pm, this isn't really a problem as the shops in Main Street are open for you to browse.Food etc is expensive but we expected it so were not shocked at the prices. We ate in the Plaza Gardens at lunchtime which is in Main Street, this is a buffet restaurant and the food was excellent. The total cost of our meal for all 5 of us was approx   90 and this included unlimited soft drinks. There was a huge variety of food to choose from and the standard was as good as any 4* hotel that I have stayed in, we found it excellent value for money. I wasn't convinced that the Sun deal was going to be as it said e.g.   9.50 for a family of four but it was!! Yes it's a tiring day, we got there early and left late and managed to do and see the majority of what we wanted to. Another day would have been nice but personally i don't think that the cost of booking into one of the Disney hotels warranted it. We stayed overnight in Dover on our return and had a goods night sleep before we travelled home,this worked for us and we were glad that we had decided to do so as we were all exhausted!The one day ticket allows entry into both the Disney Park and Disney Studios.",Disneyland_Paris
126513045,4,2011-7,Cyprus,I suggested you when visiting disney park try to not stay only for one day.....is not enough! There 're a lot of amazing themes even for adults! If you plan to stay more than one day buy a disney pass for all days for the both parks. If you get this you can visit the both parks any time you want. The only negative is the prices of the food inside the park is too expensive....we've paid 70 euros for 6 cold sandwiches and soft drinks.Remember you can't get any food and drinks inside the park!!!,Disneyland_Paris
126495940,5,2012-3,United Kingdom,"On arrival at the parc we found that we had quite a walk to the actual entrance, be prepared for moaning from small kiddies, hence the buggy was essential! Entrance was speedy and easy as we already had passes due to staying in the davy crockett disney ranch. Once in you are looking down mainstreet with the princess palace at the end... it has the kind of effect on small children that every parent will remember. Mine were awestruck! They stood there for some time just taking it in and staring! Our first afternoon was a bit of a disaster, but i think it was because we were trying to do everything and see everything at once. When you accept that this just isnt possible then its a lot more manageble. I wish that we had planned what we were doing on the first afternoon as it was a bit of a waste just wandering around, but you live and learn. The park itself is clean and tidy and there are plenty of loos, although some do have queues so try to find the ones that are a bit more out of the way. The ride waiting times werent bad, the longest i think was 40mins, but there are a lot of things for littlies to look at and listen to so its not too horrendous.Food and drink are EXTORTIONATE! We were lucky in that we had booked half board so were given vouchers that entitled us to one meal per day in the park restaurants. Well worth the money we paid. I know that you arent meant to take drinks in but we took sports bottles of juice for the kids aswell as quite a lot of juice top ups for them aswell. They never queried that or the biscuits and crisps that are stored in the nappy bag (although they did insist on scanning it at security!! lol)If you want to pay for food then the restaurants in the disney village, which is just outside the main park entrance, are slightly better in price. A mc donalds will probably cost you about a third more than it would at home, and there are hot filled sarnies etc for around seven euros..... Its a small world boat ride was a major hit with our two year old, i think he couldve happily sat on that all day long. Phantom manor was again loved by the 2yr old but the 4yr old was less than impressed! (The older 2 loved it though). The stream train is fab, but we learnt that we shouldnt have queued with everyone else at the mainstreet station, and shouldve gone round to one of the other ones where there were next to no queues! There is a LOT of walking involved so make sure that everyone has comfortable shoes on. You can hire pushchairs on the park, but we took our own and never had a problem leaving it anywhere, everyone seems to keep an eye on one another things. The evening parade is well worth watching, but if your there for more than one evening then the rides are generally quiet whilst its on so make the most of that time! Also if you havent booked a restaurant and can drag yourself away five mins before the end of the parade then you will be ok getting a table. If possible try to see the park after dark... its even more magical! We were there for 2 nights (3 days) and it was no where near enough to see everything. We are booking to go back next march and cant wait to explore some more!",Disneyland_Paris
126485110,4,2012-3,Canada,"If you are a fan of the Disney magic, you will not be disappointed spending a day here. The park is very similar to its counterpart in Florida, although on a slightly smaller scale. Although many of the rides and attractions are similar to those in Disney World, they are not identical which makes you feel as if you are not duplicating the experience here. Most of the ride names are in their French equivalent, and its fun to hear your favourite characters speaking in French and English. Being more modern than its counterparts, some rides such as Thunder Mountain and Space Mountain are more intense and include loops. Using the Fast Pass system effectively, you should have no problem visiting every attraction in one day...although I admit we were not there on a peak day. That said, as a result of it not being a peak period, many of the rides and attractions were closed with fences around them so you could not even see them. This did put a small damper on things, and make some parts of the park appear like a construction site...a bit more of the magic of Disney could be used here so as to make you feel as if you aren't missing out on something special behind those large fences. The food at this park is much better than that provided at its Florida counterpart. All the queues are handled with the usual Disney efficiency, except the queue to enter the park through the security gates. Here it is a bit of a cattle rush and not the most pleasant start to the adventure. During off peak times, there are deals to be had on tickets, so shop around in advance. On the day we went, the park hours were listed as 10 to 7. However, there had been early opening hours for those staying at the resorts, and we were allowed into the park at about 9:30. The stores along Main Street also stay open well past the 7 pm time, so you can use that extra time to your advantage.",Disneyland_Paris

Extremely courteous and well presented driver. Would recommend for any family with young kids who have, buggies etc that don't need the extra hassle of trying to negotiate a bus after the flight!We had intended to get the bus back before we left for trip because we knew the bus did a collection from New York Hotel but we arranged to get the transfer back because it we could arrange a pick up time to suit us and they we so good.",Disneyland_Paris

126353085,4,2012-3,United States,"Our family of five visited Disneyland Paris for three nights over a weekend in March. Our children are 11, 10 and 8 and have been to Disneyland in California as well as DisneyWorld, Orlando. The two parks, while much smaller, were just as much fun for us all. The family favorites were Space Mountain: Mission 2, Tower of Terror and The Rockin' Rollercoaster. Space Mountain at this park goes upside down, so it is a much more exciting ride for older kids, as does the Rockin' Rollercoaster. Be sure to measure the kids before you go so as to avoid any disappointments.During our visit the weather was really unpleasant. It was chilly and overcast the whole time with periods of rain. Despite this, the trip was still fun. Thankfully most of the attractions are inside and the majority of the waiting areas are covered.We spent two days in the parks which we felt was more than enough. We did everything we wanted to with a couple of exceptions (Crush's Coaster  line was always more than one hour long and there is no FastPass option). We had the Park Hopper option and went back and forth easily between both parks. On our second day we left the parks in the early afternoon to swim at the hotel. During low season I would think that two days is plenty even with small children. We were surprised how crowded the park was, and would not even want to imagine how crowded it must be in the summer and during school holidays. Three days in the parks might be more necessary during high season with little ones. Two is still plenty with older kids.Must do: Plan your rides around the FastPass and take advantage of Extra Magic hours if staying in one of the park hotels.Skip: Captain EO (no matter how much you might like Michael Jackson, this was horrible and an utter waste of time! It's also only in English, prompting some  boo's  from the Francophones in the crowd.)

We still had a great time, though!One piece of advice, if you are planning on taking your daughter to  Lunch with the princesses  be prepared to spend $247.00 on lunch for a family of four. Indeed, we had Ariel, Cinderella and her Mice and Snow White with Prince Charming come by our table and visit at length with our daughter. That part was great.The menu is fixed price and the selection is minimal. The kids menu started with a green salad and salmon mousse, followed by a choice of beef, lamb, veal or duck with fresh vegetables. Dessert was a cantaloupe shake, cheesecake and chocolate mousse. The adult menu was about the same, with a few more selections. Now, I don't know about your kids, but mine would not touch any of their food.

Loved every minute of it! The weather could not have been better it was 22 degrees! I even have tan lines! The staff are very baby friendly. The baby swap is a great idea but we didnt need it as the park wasn't that busy. The park is on the expensive side to be far to other peoples comments. We had to buy our baba a hat to shade her from the sun. It was to big for her as they dont sell baby size hats.    14 for a ugly hat that I wouldnt dress my daughter in normally was a bit much. The parade at the end of the day was great! A big must if you go. We left our pushchair to go on some rides as a family and come back to it still there haha so dont feel you cant left it anywhere.We found it very helpful taking snacks and a bottle of water (cheaper!) all these are aloud to be taken in with you.We are going to return next year with our extended family.

Just looking to book for this year and found out FOOD and DRINK are not allowed to be taken into the park, you can only eat and dirnk there if it is purchased from them, this was just too much after all the other expense and high prices charged, so will be looking for somewhere else : ( cant believe Disney feels it is an acceptable policy to not allow me to take drinks for the kids in the day!",Disneyland_Paris

126126557,1,2012-3,United Kingdom,"Just returned from a three day holiday and am amazed at the prices. If a builder in the UK overcharged by this they would be in front of a judge for fraud!!My daughter asked to have a 20 min princess treatment, Face paint wear a dress and photo taken   60.00. If you wanted to buy a princess dress in the park they can cost up to   65.00!! that is double the UK disney store price.A hot dog and drink each for lunch be prepared to shell out over   40.00. Then you have the attitude if a lot of the staff, they suddenly shut exits at the park and when we went to take the train with two young kids and all our cases as we walked from the Disneyland Hotel to the exit that had been open all week the security guard decided to shut it and with a shrug his shoulders and make us walk away form the station to the MGM exit with no explanation as to why.When we eventually got back to the other side he had reopened it and was letting people through, this is typical of the attitude of the staff.If you want the Disney experience go to the states, the extra travel costs will be offset by the more realistic prices and the Americans can do what the Europeans cant and give you OTT customer service that makes you feel valued and give the place that Disney magic that is sadly missing in Paris.",Disneyland_Paris
126097675,4,2012-3,United Kingdom,"Ok so perhaps a little strong but you have to realise that the main aim of the park is to extract as much money as they physically can from you with minimal effort. Water 2.99 euros. Food mediocre. Rides, short, Queues long. 80% of staff friendly. Toilets difficult to spot. Too many grownups (why are they on childrens rides??). Ban smoking. A number of rides restaurants out of action (refubishment)   understand but just shut the park for the week or offer discounts!Best value place we ate was Pizza Planet as you could have as little or as much as you wanted (we also did California Grill, some Steakhouse place, New York Hotel).Kids liked the whole experience but as a parent will go to US next time as happier and more service orientated by nature",Disneyland_Paris

Food in the park wasn't too bad   a bit pricey though. There was a 'Mickey' popcorn holder   which could be refilled for 5.10 Euros. This went down well with my 6 yo daughter   as once the popcorn was finished she used the holder to store the park guides, etc.. ! If you are staying in one of the Disney hotels, you'll get in to the park at 8am (opening time nomally is 10am), although many of the rides aren't open until 10am !! I think they try to manage expectations with regard to 'waiting' times. Apart from one or two occassions   we were queued and through the ride before the suggested timescale provided, which was great ! Highlights   the stunt show and Animagique !

126037979,4,2012-3,United States,"I have heard a lot about disgruntled visitors who have spent thousands on trips to Disneyland Paris and spend most of their time there queuing. This is how we did it...Firstly we collected tokens in The Sun, they come out in November and you need to collect 10. Using these vouchers allowed us to book a ferry crossing, accommodation for 2 nights at Newport Bay Disney Hotel and Park tickets for 1 day, for around   350 for 2 adults and 2 kids. Before we left we packed a bag full of breakfast and lunch things and as we were on an early morning sailing just bought coffee on the ferry and had our shop bought croissants, brioche etc. It is 195 miles from Calais to Disney and as we had small children thought we'd use the slightly more direct toll roads that cost about 15 20   . There is an alternative route that is only 14 miles more and as the roads in France tend to be a lot less congested than the south east of england it is not a bad option if you have the time and want to save a few quid. Fuel in France is about 10% cheaper than England so it is worth filling up in France but you should avoid using the motorway services as they are just as inflated as the UK ones.On the toll roads there are absolutely loads of Rest Areas that have toilet facilities as well as picnic areas so you really don't need to bother with service stations unless you need a coffee. But if you do stop at one of these beware that the prices are steep, think 4    for a plate of chips and 3    for a coffee. The hotel was huge and although it has a smaller kids play area than the service station we stopped at, it did also have a small (expensive   approx 1    per play) games room as well as a really nice swimming pool at no extra charge that provide towels, arm bands and floats to guests (and to my delight does not seem to live by that strange french 'speedo trunks  only' rule). Drinks in the hotel are also dear but that was ok as we bought a bottle on the boat and then made use of the seating area outside by the lake. There are lots of shops & restaurants in the Disney Village area just outside the park and most have set menus displayed outside, we opted for Planet Holywood but there is McDonalds if you prefer a take away. You should, however try to get into a restaurant before the park closes at 8pm Mon Fri 10pm Sat Sun to avoid a long queue.We had travelled on the Friday with park tickets for the Saturday so in the morning we were up early and down fro breakfast at about 7, this early start was necessary as we would have been queuing up the stairs for a table had we got there much later.In the park you would do well to get fast passes for the popular rides as the queues can be very long but the fast pass scheme allows you to come back at a later time and use a special short cut to the ride with hardly any queuing. If you get into the park early you won't have to wait to long for your first attraction but as the park fills up the queues get longer. In order to make the most of it you should try to see one attraction while waiting for our fast pass slot in the morning and then as the queues start getting longer grab another fast pass for later on then zoom over to the Studios to watch a show or two which tend to have little or no waiting time, this is especially true for the english speakers as it is the french speaking attractions that are busiest. Having a rest whilst watching a show early afternoon (the stunt car chase thing is excellent) allows the batteries for those little tired legs to recharge before heading off for the parade. It is also a great opportunity to tuck into your sandwiches without feeling like you are missing anything. For the parade it is best to situate yourself (to the right with your back to the station) at the train station end of main street as you get to see the parade go past twice as they go round the roundabout!All in all we managed to get on 12 attractions including 2 shows and the parade and what we saved by taking our own lunch spent on expensive toys for the kids to take home with them.",Disneyland_Paris

We bought the 2 park ticket which was    64 each was I suppose is an average price but when we got into the actual disneyland park most of the attractions were closed claiming to be getting refurbished for improvement which was disappointing. We also waited in the queue for Frontierland for approx. 50 minutes for an announcement in French saying that the ride was now out of use...we were given fastpass tickets for when it came back on but the park was closing shortly by this time so there seemed no point to this.We took in our own food but went to buy a hot choc at one of the umpteen vendors but the service was terrible...the woman serving us had the cup under the machine...pressing coffee when I clearly asked for hot choc then moved it under the choc without changing the cup...rank & lazy so I told her to forget it.the parade at 5pm was good but over very quickly. The whole experience was very disappointing and I will never return.",Disneyland_Paris

125888064,3,2012-3,Denmark,"been in Disneyland park about 8 times. This time there were some attractions closed.Pirates of caribbean. But the old 3D film with Michal Jackson had come back,that was wonderful. There is a lot to do and try. Not so much for small children ,under 4. It is a adventure to be there. But the food had become even more expensiv and as disgusting as ever. As a vegetarian,there ia almost nothing. bring your own food,or live in Davy Crocket,whee you can cook your own food. This time we were at a hotel. And no shops to buy food in Disney park or Village. If you buy a salat, it is a tiny one in plastic,and as expensiv as a meal.I think that the food experience i the Park has to be very much better and cheaper, to get the park running in the future.Everything else is ok. Some years ago You could eat at Hotel Santa Fe,but now they also only have buffet. And you dont take buffet as a vegetarien,when you can only eat a few things.Bella notte restaurant was closed,the only one with a veg pasta. We would like to come to Disneyland again,but never a Hotel again,where you cannot cook your own food. Even if you eat meat,it cost a fortune to eat",Disneyland_Paris

125793819,2,2012-3,Andorra,"I recently went to Disneyland Paris and was extremely disappointed.There are not many rides in the park and even less if you are with young children. Also, having to queue for over an hour for a very short ride gets very tiring by the end of the morning. There is an option to Fas ttrack your ticket which is very useful, but with so few rides and so many people the queues are still huge.I found the staff there to be very helpful and generally happy, the price of food in the park was reasonable and there are certainly so many shops with toys and stuff for sale.We toyed with buying a two day pass, but there is no way I was going to spend two days standing in line for a short ride.Apart from that, my four year old had a good time but became really restless having to stand around for so long.",Disneyland_Paris
125750585,4,2011-11,United Kingdom,Brillliant day. Only let down was that we didnt see any disney characters on the park all day. Luckily we got to see them next day at the studios or it would have ruined my little girls holiday.,Disneyland_Paris
125742126,3,2012-3,Singapore,"We've just returned from a lovely 5 days in Disneyland Paris, however I would like to point out that Space Mountain broke down whilst we were on it and were made to sit in the dark for what seemed like a very long time before they came to rescue us with no explanation. Rocky Mountain broke down after we'd queued for an hour   again no explanation but at least we were offered a fast pass after complaining. I can go on   so many of the rides broke or just closed for no reason. The characters are great but there is no organisation and everyone pushes in, my daughter queued so nicely to see many of the characters and was rewarded by a longer time with them as they can see what is going on. It is Disney but for what it cost us I would go to Florida next time   at least all the rides work and it's much better organised. We waited to see Mickey for about 20 mins when it was my daughters turn, they said he has to  pop  off but will be back in 5 mins   we waited nearly an hour as we were at the front but he didn't return   things like that take away the Disney magic especially for a 5 year old. All I would say we stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and she has a private audience with all the characters every morning, that was well worth the extra effort.",Disneyland_Paris
125741303,4,2012-2,United Kingdom,Really lovely park with a mix of rides although we felt it was aimed more at the under 12s. The characters need to have more organisation as often there would be a huge crowd gathered around characters only for grown adults to end up pushing younger children out of the way to get autrographs and photos. Some places have queing stations but the bigger characters did not seem to.The ride queues can get quite long Fast Pass tickets are the way forwards to avoid that.Food is basic and expensive. It is   5 for a hotdog (a big one!) and drinks are around   3 for a small soft drink.,Disneyland_Paris

This park was very nice. Only the waiting que for Crush Coaster (90 minutes) was to long. Also very expensive for food and drinks. Breakfast could be a bit more (eggs for instance). Parking was full, we couldn't park our car nearby our room. But for decor and atmosphere it's a nice park. For a first visit take 3 days for sure. Luckily it wasn't our first visit because there was so much people and waiting time that we couldn't do a lot of things, but we did them already 6 years ago and they hand't changed a lot...",Disneyland_Paris
125652962,5,2011-6,United Kingdom,"I went to Disney land with a friend for my 23rd birthday last year the Disney park is clean and tidy, the shops on main street are immaculate however a little pricey, there was some work going on, on the sleeping beauty castle, but that does not stop access to the other areas of the park. the rides were fantastic and the only ride that we queued a long time for through the week was Thunder Mountain but its totally worth the wait. on the weekend the park was heaving and the fast pass tickets were a great bonus as it cuts the queuing times down dramatically! the Disney Studios were just as clean and the queue times for some rides were just as long but on some of the rides don't have the fast pass option so you just have to wait. the aero smith rocking roller coaster was closed on the Wednesday Friday and only opened on the weekend however that has the fast pass so no need to queue, the hollywood tower of terror is an amazing ride through the week we only queued for a maximum of 15minutes( and we went on that one loads) however the weekend the fast pass was a great bonus.... food in the park can be expensive however we found some places where the food was cheaper but the quality was just as good i think we paid 12 euros for a meal, dessert and a medium drink. the Euro star station is at the gates of the magic and is clean and tidy, we stayed at one of the Disney hotels so the Disney express service saves time, when you arrive at the station you go up to the main area and follow the signs for Disney express you then find your hotel and give them your bags, then you are free to enjoy the park as they take your bags to the hotel where you are staying and you pick them up on check in. the holiday went really well and i am thinking about going in 2013 for the Halloween or Christmas celebrations. loved every minute of it AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris

Definitely worth a visit :D",Disneyland_Paris
125489709,5,2011-5,Spain,"Having visited again in May 2011 for what's probably the 12 13th time I can honestly say this really is somewhere that I could just keep going back to. We started taking the kids when they were in their pushchairs and even now they are teenagers its always been a fantastic family holiday. Disneyland Park or  The Magic Kingdom  really is just magical.The atmosphere is always wonderful and considering how busy this place can get, it never feels threatening. Somewhere safe for the children. The themes and variation of the rides for all ages are a good mixture and even some of the more  childish  rides are fun to have a go on. The language barrier can sometimes be a problem but this has never been a problem as the staff are patient and understanding. You can get your point accross in the end ha ha but you shouldnt expect the whole of the planet to speak English! in their country we should be trying to speak their language.The amount and choices of restaurants is good but they arent always all open at the same times so always check. if your looking for somewhere to eat for that special occassion then make sure you go to Walts in Main Street. I could write a million words in this review and wouldnt even scratch the surface. So as the title suggest  Just Go There",Disneyland_Paris
125475051,3,2012-2,United Kingdom,"Myself and my wife took my little girl as a surprise for her 5th Bday and we were all really looking forward to it. Firstly the Euro star was great. It left on time, the guy from Disney gave us all the info and it was really easy and stress free. Then we arrived at Disney and the stress levels got cranked up to about 9 on the ricter scale. The French people were so rude and ignorant it was unbelievable. At one point a woman actually moved my little girls face out the way of Aladins lamp with her huge backside and after a day of people pushing in the ride ques, bumping into you in the ride ques or just generally being rude I lost my temper and there was nearly the battle of Waterloo all over again.So after a day at the park we got the shuttle bus that was regular and about a 12 minute drive to our appartment that was a little busy at breakfast time but in general very clean, comfortable and relaxing. One thing I will say is if you fancy a few beers after a long day of wrestling with the locals then at 6.50 euros a time this place isn't for you.The weather was chilly but bright and dry which was great. My little girl was mesmerised by the princesses when we took her for lunch with them but this was an extra   185 for the three of us but well worth it for her to be able to have some 1 on 1 time with them.One thing I will say which was a little alarming was that we noticed a few strange people hanging around without any children of their own and after reading another persons review on this site who raised the same point I feel the need to reiterate this to stress the need to keep and eye on your children at all times ( stupid thing to say I know ) but we had one experience in a small Baverian Bar next to the Disney Studio with a strange couple that I later saw taking pictures of children that really but the shivers up me.All in all if you are prepared to get stuck and pay the inflated prices I'm sure you and your kids will have a fantastic time as after all it is for them and the memories.Ta",Disneyland_Paris
125436212,2,2012-2,United States,"We bought season pass tickets for Disney as we live in Paris, and have been there three times already. Once in December (a very busy time), once in January, and once at the end of February. The day we went in December was extremely busy (granted it was close to Christmas), and lines were extremely long. Even Buzz Lightyear was over an hour wait, and we utilized Fast pass on that one. Utilizing fast passes though, in total, we only rode about 5 rides for the whole day. Lines were just crazy long. My main complaint is that the park does not have designated smoking areas for the smokers. Do you know how many people smoke in Europe?!!! There are smokers everywhere, and they even smoke while waiting in the lines, even though there are non smoking signs clearly marked there. The visits in January and February were more tolerable (less people, less smokers), but again we were constantly walking into wafts of smoke, and again we had to deal with idiots smoking in line. I told one employee who told the young girls it was not allowed, only to have the young girls continue to smoke, and clearly flout the authority of the employee. It's ridiculous. I had to yell at them to get them to stop, and the whole scene is not ideal for kids (including me having to yell). In terms of public smoking, Disneyland Paris is 30 years behind the US. Just have designated smoking areas! Finally, as to the park itself, it pales in comparison to the Anaheim Disneyland and Disney world. It's not terrible, but smaller, though my son did like the Suspension Bridge. Thunder mountain was closed on 2 of our visits, but we finally got to ride it on our last visit. The second park, Disney Studios, is very small, and seemed like an afterthought. Even the tram ride left much to be desired, but lines here in Jan Feb were much shorter (approx 20 minutes), though my son wanted to leave that park quickly and go back to Disney. In all, I won't be returning to Disneyland Paris once our passes are through, and don't recommend this park to anyone. If you're going to Disney, go to the one in America, go to the original.",Disneyland_Paris

However, it really is a fantastic time especially for children under 9 (height restrictions excepted for certain rides) and with the sectioning out of the park, planninng what you wanted to do and when was important. The Dream Parade seemed to be smaller than the previous time we visited and there were a number of  rides  and restaurants that were not open when we were there. Was really glad of the early opening facility that you get when staying at a Disney hotel so we were able to do some of the popular rides early although it also meant that the photo opportunity was not available as the booth does not open until the true opening time.",Disneyland_Paris

The Peter Pan cast were amazing   signing books and photos was done with such enthusiasm. The Cars Stunt show was fabulous ... a real eye opener (even for a four year old little girl).All in all, a fab time had by all   the only down side is the expense and quality of the food inside the park .... but there are plenty of picnic benches if the weather is good enough to make up for this.",Disneyland_Paris
124985294,4,2012-2,United States,We went in february which was very cold but dry so queuing etc is fine. Queues not bad during the week   average of about 20 mins. Make sure you use the fastpass system   its free and not everyone uses it because they dont understand the system. If your a Disney resident you can often get into disneyland a couple of hours earlier   not everything is open so don't go mad to get there at 8.00 but some effort is well worth it.

Onsite food and drink is Very expensive which is only to be expected as you are captive. Food quality is utter rubish for what you have to pay. A filet steak costs less in a decent restaurant in the UK than a cheeseburger at a Disney Hotel or Park. Its all the same price. Santa Fe Hotel is tired but clean. An evening Buffet meal for 4 adults and child(6) with 1 soft drink each costs over   100 and the plates are from a plastic picnic set. Its almost impossible to find any proper vegatables anywhere. lots of queueing but only to be expected as British half term and a French national holiday weekend.Overall a great time, but as grandparents trying to keep up with a daughter and her 2 kids14 and 6. I need a few days peace and quiet",Disneyland_Paris

124918459,4,2012-2,United Kingdom,"Just got back with a half term break, stayed at the Magic Circus hotel which is the no 54 bus from the Disney station. All good in the hotel and no problem with using the shuttle set up. Take your swim suit the kids will love the pool.As for the Disney Parcs we did them both with a day off in between as our kids are 6 & 3.You get the whole lot here, our English waynettas and their buggies, the smoking ban defying germans, the student Spanish hoards and the French who would happily push a child out of the way.We had a great time, loved the rides we went on and left the ones where the queue time was too big.In the Disney studio the car stunt show was very good. We only ate once at the blockbuster cafe which wasn't too bad value for a pizza or a salad.Only tips I would say is try to have some sort of order and get as many fast passes as you can, even if you have to split up, we managed to get our eldest onto some rides twice very quickly and she loved it, especially the Terror Tower in the studio.All in all a great few days, yes the rides could be far better at loading, but with 1000's of the great euro public on site they do the best they can, if you don't like the prices for stuff, simple, do not pay it, it really shouldn't ruin little jonny's trip if you can sort some form of food alternative that isn't Disney branded. The train staion supermarket ain't the bad at all for a cheap sandwich or drink.Would I go again, probably when our youngest can do all the rides, about 7 yr old.Can't see the point of the Disney hotel rip off either but that's another review.",Disneyland_Paris

(this is all well and good but usually prior warning is given on this). Generally most things were ok but there just wasnt the spark to make it magical, lots of areas of the park look they need a good refurb not something you expect at disney. Alot of the cafe areas e.t.c were also shut, the walt disney studios park was generally better for the kids better rides and lots of shows, found the disneyland park was ok but lots of outdated rides and areas with not alot to do.

124865364,2,2012-2,United Kingdom,"Half Term as parents with an eight year old, we embarked upon our first trip to Disneyland Paris and overall, felt disappointed despite our child enjoying the experience. Pros: pain free transfer from CDG airport on VEA Navette to the resort; staying at Disney's Hotel New York was close to the parks and provided plenty photo opportunities with Disney characters. Cons: hotel's well publicised ice skating rink was an additional cost despite staying there and anyway, was out of use for the full four days, despite freezing temperatures outside and Disney lakes being frozen over thus halting boat trips. Accommodation requires urgent updating. Food is unhealthy, tasteless and of a poor standard throughout. We chose not to opt for meal deals as part of out package, thinking this would provide the freedom and choice for better food. How wrong were we? Believe it or not, the best place for a fresh salad and water was McDonalds! Shame on you Disney. Also their coffee machines throughout the resort are awful. Best coffee was at the airport. Tips: use FastPass where you can; the Disneyland Paris App is not always updated with queue times etc. or does not offer the option of making a restaurant reservation; buy tickets for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show; best 'Cast Members' were those at the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror.",Disneyland_Paris
124865222,5,2012-2,United Kingdom,"We went to the park Saturday straight from the station and the first person we saw on entering through the gates was Mickey himself. We queued for our daughters to have a photo with him for no more than 10 mins it was excellent, they were made to feel very special, an excellent start to the holiday. Space Mountain was good, enjoyed by our 13 year old although I have to say we all enjoyed Thunder Mountain a bit better, it was just as fast, you could see what was happening and the seats were better designed so your head didn't get bashed about. For the smaller ones (and us big kids) the Peter Pan ride was a favourite I think we went on about 6 times in all. The carousel is OK but it takes longer for them to get you settled than the ride takes, it could be a minute or so longer in our opinion. Don't miss the main street parade it was far better than we anticipated! 5pm every night",Disneyland_Paris
124861827,4,2012-2,United Kingdom,"The best ride we went on with our 5 year old son was Buzz Lightyear. We must have went on this ride over 5 times. The haunted house was good too but in need of refurbishment and updates as it is exactly the same as it was 15 years ago. The shops are bril, and the best time to visit is during the week. We hardly queued for any of the rides more than 10 minutes on the Monday. But again, it's Disney and it just makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.",Disneyland_Paris
124859111,4,2012-2,Thailand,"5th time we have been, we have toddler and teenagers and they all love it in different ways. The little ones love the parades and character greets and the teenagers love the fast rides, they even managed to persuade us to go on a couple! Queues can be bad for rides with no fast passes like crushes coaster in disney studios and the new toy story rides in there, most fantasy land rides have big queues and if your little ones cant walk there is nothing really for them to do! There were no shows in the main park at this time of year and only 1 short parade. There were barracades up everywhere and work going on which spoilt the look of the place especially if it was the first ever visit, quite a few rides were closed also! I would go again at a different time of year. Food is expensive so bring some if you can, pushchairs can be hired but are again very expensive and ours was gone when we got off a ride! Use of fast passes is great for popular rides, dinner vouchers can be used for cowboy cookout in frontierland which is a character diner which is great, (the food is average but the character interaction is great but make sure you book a table!). No fireworks at this time of year also!",Disneyland_Paris
124855920,4,2012-2,United Kingdom,"Well, just back from Disneyland Paris having gone away with friends at the last minute. I went as a lone parent with 3 kids (8, 5 and 1) as my hubby had to work. And I survived and even had fun. Much of that was down to having 2 sets of friends there at the same time as without the extra help it would have been a nightmare but extra hands and a plenty of wee buddies meant for a great BUT exhausting few days. The parks were fine during the week but come Saturday and Sunday even in February the crowds and wait times were just unbearable. If you hate crowds go off season like we did and avoid the weekends. During the week was busy but queue times tolerable especially with fast pass. Kids had such a great time, characters did it for my 5 year old and the 8 year old is tall so went on all the big rides and became an adrenaline junky. The 1 year old did great, a lot of time in buggy but napped well and the baby centres were great. My only complaint is as you need to leave push chairs outside you really need an extra pair of hand to wash your hands etc. which I didn't have. All in all great fun.",Disneyland_Paris
124824688,5,2012-2,United Kingdom,Just had a great trip to Disneyland Paris.  The children loved it! The rides were great fun   so much detail!  Yes it was expensive   but we watched what we bought!  We thought it was well worth it!,Disneyland_Paris
124811435,3,2012-2,United Kingdom,"Half term at Disneyland Paris is not for the feint hearted, a birthday treat for the kids it may have been, but definitely became an exercise in maintaining parental boundaries and discipline. I honestly don   t think I have seen so many chastised kids in one place! Basically this is a total retail experience with a few fairground attractions thrown in. Granted the kids loved seeing the characters and it certainly toughened them up to a more continental approach to the notion of queuing and taking your turn but increasingly as the days passed the whole experience became clearly over priced enticement to buy Disney products. Both Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios have limited rides for toddlers & younger children and all have long queues for a very short ride. The birthday tea party with the characters cost   17 per person (Kids & Adults alike) for that we got coffee, juice and a selection of pastries & marshmallows. The additional Birthday cake cost a further   31 (Booked through Disneydirect). It was a perfectly nice chocolate cake but certainly not a   31 cake! We put all that aside and accepted that like everything else the Disney mark up and increased costs in France played there part. The parks themselves were not fully open and many areas were being repaired or constructed, this certainly didn   t promote the magical experience promised. Our youngest was very confused that all the characters spoke French first and then English this was slightly distracting when trying to suspend his disbelief. While the hotel Cheyenne that we stayed in was comfortable and clean, the dinning arrangements were not an enjoyable experience. The Chuck Wagon cafe provided a buffet style arrangement that involved long queues again despite the laughable encouragement to reserve a table????. Once in the buffet area a free for all ensued which trying to navigate with two kids was a complete nightmare, then locate a free and cleared table to settle everyone to finally eat. Breakfasts were much the same. Oh and If you want a coffee in your room you will need to buy the  tea basket  7e for two tea bags, two coffee sachets, 4 UHT milk pots, 4 sugars and 4 Disney biscuits. I wasn   t naive enough to think that the magic kingdom was really as glossy and wonderful as its adverts would have you believe, however I wasn   t quite prepared to feel as though I'd been totally fleeced by a mouse.My advice if you really want the kids to experience Disney, then go to Florida, at least there   s less chance it will be cold and rainy.",Disneyland_Paris
124793056,4,2012-2,United Kingdom,"Disneyland is always worth a visit, whenever you go there is something for every one. however in Paris they are not too efficient when it comes to loading the rides, which makes for very long unnecessary queues.",Disneyland_Paris
124792856,5,2012-2,United Kingdom,"The detail is very impressive. My favourite bit was Main Street USA. I also liked Adventureland. The one criticism is the blatant  rip offness  and the constant attempts to get you to part with your cash. On some rides, you get off and then find yourself in a shop!",Disneyland_Paris
124774467,4,2012-2,United Kingdom,"Had a lovely magical feeling, great attention to detail.  Food far too expensive and not great.  Souvenirs & snack also too expensive.  We loved the Buzz lightyear ride and the Indiana Jones   well worth queueing up for!",Disneyland_Paris
124763278,3,2012-2,Australia,This was a tuff one! Do we or do we not go to `Disneyland?Being that we were travelling with a 4.5 year old and had heard average reviews we decided for him to go anyway. It was his first time!We went on a thursday and are travelling low season so no wait to get in or on rides however `as the day progressed then the waits were 30   45 mins !You can get there easily by train but we travelled by private transport as was not prepared to hike it out on public transport with grandma in tow. TIP: If you travel by car do park at the Disneyland Hotel ( pink hotel) entrance car park and enter thru the main hotel entrance go straight ahead thru the lobby and exit the hotel to go right outside to the park and you can purchase tickets at small ticket window and enter the park with no wait. Be aware that nearly every building is a SHOP with the usual Disney merchandise you cant escape the park without buying something. Plan to `eat before or after normal lunch time to avoid a crowd not so bad for us at 1pm.Food was OK as youd expect for a property this size go for a meal deal its cheaper and do buy the L'enfant (kids) meals even if youre a grown up! You can save upto 5 euros!Get there early park opens at 10am low season and we hired a  pushchair  bigger than stroller at only 8.50 euros for the day so when Mr 4.5 got tired of walking we just put him in it and kept going. If travelling in winter dress your kids in water proof jacket pants and warm hat (think snow gear) as if it rains they will be warm. It drizzled throughout the day little man was fine. Honestly if we had our time again we wouldnt bother.It was 53 euros each and felt like a waste of money like we were paying for the priviliage to shop. This Disney property is not a pinch on the Disney properties in the USA where I have been many times! It is much much smaller we saw the whole park in 5 hours unlike the USA properties which takes days!I would not recommend even though my son enjoyed it BECAUSE I KNOW `Disney can do MUCH Better than this  not really good value for money especially if you have more than 1 child.TIP: If the kids dont know its there   dont go to Euro Disney you'll save yourself some cash and then some. Long hike for what it is   disappointing!Sorry cant recommend this property!,Disneyland_Paris

124735909,4,2012-2,United Kingdom,"We've just returned home from a 4 night stay in the Hotel Cheyenne. On the first day, I was a bit underwhelmed, as we were trying to pack in everything and I missed the whole magic about it. Visiting again the second day, I noticed all the great design and detail that has gone into the rides, etc. Even the facades of the many shops are well done.My 6 year old twins were excited by all the characters that popped up unexpectedly and loved getting autographs and photos. We did refuse to wait for over 60 mins on a princess though!Some rides were closed due to ice and 2 were shut due to refurbishments. That's just your luck of the draw.Yes, it was cold, but we expected that. It is February afterall and Europe has been getting terrible weather. People who complained about the cold need better clothes. Get the thermals on and big coats, hats, scarfs and gloves. Expecting Disney to heat the outdoors is nonsense.Yes, there were also queues. There was only one ride we didn't get on due to the massive queues   Autopia   but we felt it wasn't worth the wait. For other bigger rides, we either used the Fast Pass or went back during the parade or between 5 and 6pm. Indiana Jones only had a 5 min queue during the parade, but over 40 50 mins during the afternoon. For some of the smaller rides we had to queue, but usually not more than 30 mins. We ate at the counter service cafes as these were cheaper. Usual fare of fast food, but it tasted fine.Overall, I enjoyed the experience and would go back.",Disneyland_Paris
124730253,5,2012-2,United Kingdom,"We visited in February and it was oh so cold (minus 7 degrees Celcius) but still had a fantastic time. Some rides suffered because of the cold   they were frozen up for several times during our 5 day visit. We've been to Disney Florida & California   Paris doesn't match them for weather but contents are excellent (despite being a smaller park) but still really good fun, This park is for old, young and everyone in between (park opens at 8am for those staying at a Disney Hotel and plenty to choose from) All the rides are good   don't missand don't forget to use your Fastpass.

This place needs new rides big time. The old stuff just cant cut it anymore, Theres construction going on all over the place and the food halls were all so packed.

124699028,2,2012-2,United Kingdom,"Park has a huge amount of hotels surrounding it but is not big enough to cope with the numbers as it has hardly any rides   just one main ride in each 'land' we went off peak and queues were horrendous as there's just not enough to go on. This means queue waits are in excess of 1 hour which is a nightmare for small children. Fast track where you get a ticket and then an allocated time allowing you to queue jump in available (free) on some rides and helps, but there simply aren't enough rides or attractions, gardens(none), play parks saw two small ones but both closed to play in. Many rides nothing out of the ordinary, tea cups, generic up down and round and round ride for kids, dumbo, rockets, aladdin etc all the same ride. It is very pretty but it just doesn't deliver on the ride or activity front.

124639950,1,2012-2,United Kingdom,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at The Newport Bay, Disneyland Paris & I'm furious at the shabbiness of the whole complex. The room still had rubbish in it when we arrived & they didn't even provide tea or coffee in the rooms. You are allocated a time for breakfast & then still have to queue for 25min to be seated. On arrival we were railroaded into having breakfast at the Plaza Gardens one morning but didn't know where that was we then found out it's a good 20 minute walk into the park & I was using a walking stick for a knee injury. The park itself is just a huge shopping centre. The food is overpriced and poor   even the coffee at 5 euros was undrinkable  many people we met complained that it was cold and that there was no choice. A lot of the park was a building site and the queues over an hour   I dread to think what it is like in peak season when the weather is better. My 7year old & I queued for over an hour to get to meet a princess and they turned around and said she was leaving. A number of very angry parents complained and after another 15 minutes she came back but apparently this is common practice. There is no care for how this affects children all they want is for you to spend money on expensive souvinirs and overpriced food. Of course once you have paid there is nowhere to go with it and you don't have any alternative choices as it is such a closed shop. Not worth the money at all. I feel so sad for my kids who have been desperate to go for years. : (",Disneyland_Paris
124612785,5,2012-2,United Kingdom,"We went to Disneyland Paris between 11   14th February. We had been to Disneyland six years ago and decided to go back due to all the new rides since we last went (Crush Coaster, Toy Story Land, Tower of Terror, Buzz ride etc).Reading all the recent mixed reviews I thought blimey the place has gone downhill since I last went, but how wrong could I be.Yes it was cold, very cold but dry, would rather be cold than wet. We stayed at Hotel Cheynne in two rooms which Reception put us side by side and we had adjoring room doors which was ideal. The rooms were perfect for us to use. Even a free to use Safe. Breakfast is a mad rush but we expceted that. Dont be British and Q, just go in and get your stuff   everyone else does.Shuttle rides to the park frequent and ideal.We made use of the early entrance time and managed to do all the kiddie rides, Space mountain and Buzz all in the two hours. We stayed in the park until 9pm on Sat and Sun and the park is empty   everyone pretty much goes home after six. We did the entire park in 3 hours ideal.As a family we prefer the Disney Studios, the shows are amazing, make sure you see Stich Live, but ensure you see the English show!! Dont miss that. Animagic and Cinemagic were also both very good. Make sure you see them.Our youngest (7 years 1.25m) loved the Aerosmith Rollercoaster   was her fave ride and rode it 8 times over the 4 days there.Eating, prices as you would expect, but they have range from cheap to stupid expensive. We ate at the Over the Counter restaurants, and the food was lovely.   2.99 for a bottle of coke is a rip off mind you.....Overall, we had a great time and would deffo return. As its not the most cheapest place to goto it wont be for a few years and at least until they have some new rides etc.",Disneyland_Paris

We stayed in the Davy Crockett ranch and the accomadation was excellent, spacious, clean. modern, but above all really warm, I needed it after being out in the cold all day.

124428989,5,2012-2,United Kingdom,"We visited this park on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd of February 2012. Due to the weather (we didn't hit   temperatures once throughout our whole stay) the park was nearly empty and the longest we queued for any ride was about 15 minutes which really works out well as once you're within the 15 minute queue time your in the insde bit of the ride anyway to keep warm   and you keep moving throughout the park.We only ate once in the mark at Marionette's Chalet in Fantasyland and found the meals to be quite good value for the amount of food we got (huge portions!)Favourite attraction is by far Buzz Lightyear's Laser Blast   one not to be missed and perfect for the whole family. (Great for a little friendly competition!) We also loved Pirates of the Carribean, Indiana Jones (although I wouldn't bother queueing for longer than 15 minutes as the ride is only 30 seconds long), It's a Small World (great for smaller kids) and the Haunted Mansion ride (name has slipped my memory   sorry!). We rode Space Mountain and the biggest tip I could give is be prepared if you're shorter than 5 ft 8. I'm 5ft 5 and although the head restraint was down as far as it could go, throughout the course of the ride my head smashed against either side of the restraint four to five times giving me a severe headache   just a warning! Taller people wouldn't have that issue as my boyfriend (at 6ft3) had no problems. A ride that we enjoye less was Star Tours (far too jerky although not one to be missed)The parade was really impressive (as you'd expect) although lasted for a little bit too long in the freezing cold weather at 5pm!We loved the shops on Main Street and spent hours in there on our last day.Also (I don't know if it was due to the time of year) but if you bought lunch in one of the counter service restaurants you were given a voucher entitling you to one free hot drink after 3pm at another counter service restaurant. Princess Pavilion, if you have little girls or teenagers who love the princesses like me then you really have to visit! But beware   the queue time is horrific. We queued for about an hour and a half. There is currently no description on the map and the one on the schedule is very cryptic. It was by far the most magical moment of the holiday when I finally turned a corner and saw Belle there waiting for me to take a picture!Both my boyfriend and I enjoyed the Park much more than the Studios and the Studios is meant for older children! But if you love the magic of Disney, like us, you will prefer the Disneyland Park too :)",Disneyland_Paris
124402253,5,2011-12,United States,"We spent Christmas Day at Disney and had a great time. With only 2 parks, one full day, 10:00 am  10:00 pm, was enough time to see and ride almost everything!I do recommend getting the Fast Pass. Our group was 4 adults and 2 teenagers, 13 and 16, who like to go on all the fast rides. The Fast Pass allowed us on some rides without a wait. The more popular rides had a wait time of under 15 minutes. Without the Fast Pass, wait time was about double on the popular rides.The special effects and stunt shows were great! Space Mountain and Aerosmith roller coasters were terrific. Tower of Terror was lots of fun. Even It's a Small World was unexpectedly fun because of the Christmas music and themed holiday exhibits. The Disney parade was packed with adults and children of all ages taking pictures and oohing and aahing at all the Disney characters who spoke French (!) with the Disney Castle in the background.We ate expensive mediocre fast food all day..that's what we planned on doing. We took the RER out from Paris. It's about a 45 minute ride and very easy to do. Those who frequent Disney in the States may be disappointed in the small size of Disneyland Paris.

124302327,4,2012-2,United Kingdom,"We choose to visit Disneyland in late January early February because of the special offer and lower attendance figures. We have visited the park before in July and it was hot and very, and in October and it was wet but not as busy. Early in the year is a good time to visit if you wrap up warm, the queues are short and the park is less crowdedWe spent a few days preparing for our visit by checking out the website and looking at park hours and closures so we could get the most from our trip. I also downloaded the iPhone app recommended on the official website so I could check wait times etc once in the park, it doesn   t work as there is very limited no signal in the parks, and even the staff said it was a waste of time as it doesn   t work. During our stay temperatures were hitting  9 and some of the outside attractions    went tec   . Half of Fantasyland was already closed for refurbishments, and Peter Pans Flight and Autopia were working occasionally despite the park guide saying they were closed, and Dumbo shut down because the hydraulics kept freezing up and the Dream Parade was cut down to three floats due to technical problems. Although busier than the Studios Park, the park was generally quiet during the week, the queues were a reasonable 5 20 minutes, and we often got to stay on rides or walk straight on. But at the weekend the park was much busier with queues up to 90 minutes for some rides and over 2 hours to see the Disney Princesses. We found that when the park opened at 8am for Extra Magic Hours, at around 9am there was a sudden surge of people, a cast member said if the park was quiet they let the general public in early. Space Mountain is much better in Paris than in Florida, and as it is one of the most popular rides the queues lines fill up quickly at weekends so try and ride them first last thing or use fastpass. We found the wait time was often as little as 5 10 minutes on weekdays, meaning you could easily ride it a couple of times. It is quite a vigorous ride, with a couple of 360 loops, but once you have re orientated yourself the scenery is spectacular. If the park is quiet and you have enough time I would recommend riding attractions with a lot of scenery e.g.    it   s a small world    twice so you can see them from both sides of the vehicle. Disney put a lot detail into the rides and it is easy to miss, and many of the    children   s    rides in Fantasyland would be even better at half the speed so that you can take it all in. One major difference between Disney in Florida and Paris was people smoking throughout the park, there are specified smoking areas but this is not upheld. There are also signs requesting no smoking in queue lines but we found this was ignored, especially outside. And although the park is generally clean you will see cigarette butts on the floor and if members of your parties are sensitive to smoke this may cause a problem. We enjoyed the Dreams parade, and got some great pictures of the characters in the first car when it stopped for nearly 20 minutes in front of us during (we think) a technical issue. The parade route does get quite congested, particularly at weekends, so use the passageways at the rear of the Main Street shops, especially if you have wheelchairs or pushchairs. Character meetings are still poorly managed at the Paris parks, although some permanent spots e.g. Town Square have queue lines, the others are a free for all and you may find you have to be very assertive if you want a picture autograph. During the colder weather you   ll find characters down the passageways behind the Main Street shops and they are often quieter and overlooked, and again it is much easier during the week than at weekends. The food is very expensive in the park, we had lunch at Agrabah Cafe and the food was poor and the service was worse, there is little choice and a small glass of Sprite was 4.20 Euros. The Plaza Garden has a buffet with more choice and the service was better, but make sure you make a reservation or you could end up standing out in the cold despite there being empty tables inside. We stopped at Casey   s Corner on Main Street for a snack, a hot dog or chicken nuggets will set you back 8 Euros. If you want a quick bite to eat try Cafe Hyperion in Discoveryland which is slightly better value, with a meal for around 10 Euros, and the children can watch cartoons on the cinema screens while you eat. The park is mostly flat and suitable for pushchairs or wheelchairs, and the wheelchair access is often through the attractions exit. If you are taking a wheelchair or you are pregnant make sure you take a Drs letter and get an Easy Access card from City Hall. The card usually only allows the card user and one person to gain    Easy Access    to an attraction, but if the park is quiet it   s always worth asking the cast member if you party is bigger if you can all ride together. We found the cast members were much stricter on the plus one rule at Disneyland park than in Studios and made two of our party use the main queue whilst our wheelchair user and plus one rode in empty vehicles.",Disneyland_Paris
124268895,4,2012-1,United Kingdom,"disney park was very good, very clean the only down side was the way people pushed passed you even the children! also thought there should of been more opportunities to meet disney characters instead of cueing for an hour, also my daughter only saw 1 disney princess the whole week we were there, she was very disappointed and said disney land wasn't like it was on the tv. but all 3 children had a very good time ages 9,7 and 3. we didnt have to cue for very long for rides which was great, we also used our magical hours, there's so much to do and do there so would recommend at least a few days there to fit everything in. would recommend booking the character breakfast kids will love it and get to meet lots of characters at the breakfast table, pricey but worth it, and if you can take your own snacks as its very pricey in there.",Disneyland_Paris

Four goes on Buzz lightyear with zero queues! Having been to Florida I suppose I was spoilt, but no fireworks,evening light parades or shows was very disappointing.. The whole area is very expensive.    2.75 for a small coffee out of a dispensing machine or    4.75 in Starbucks for a large coffee. For the four of us   18  for 4 hot drinks.

124188590,4,2011-9,Australia,"We got the 2 park pass, which is recommended as they are right next door to each other, I would go to Disneyland park first, go on the rides, space Mountain 2 is so fun and so is the kids rides like buzz light year and peter pan's ride. Then head to Walk Disney Studios after lunch, there is a stunt show, however it drags out a bit, this is mostly said in French, however some is in English. The best part was the tram ride which takes you through movie scenes and even shows you a movie set, where a truck explodes, water comes tumbling down the rocks and you get wet, it was so fun!!! A must for young, old or if you have kids.",Disneyland_Paris
124184312,4,2012-2,Belgium,"No ques, but also no disney animals at the gate or anywhere else in the park. Some attractions closed, which can happen, but without announcing the reason. A little bit better information can't be that difficult.",Disneyland_Paris
124148042,4,2012-1,United Kingdom,"It was our first trip and I was very sceptical about the whole Disney experience but was proved wrong from the minute we arrived. We took the Eurostar train from Ashford International which arrived just two hours later directly into the heart of the resort and there were regular free shuttles directly to all the hotels. We were there for 5 days   4 nights and were booked in the Sequoia Lodge. Sequoia was clean and tidy and the room we stayed in was in a Bambi theme which my two boys found a bit girlie but we were only going the sleep there. The room was very basic but had what we needed as we would be out most of the time. The breakfast was all you could eat and had a good choice although the staff were not that friendly and gave the impression that you were a nuisance at times. The cleaners came in every day and kept the room clean with toiletries topped up and clean towels so no problems there. The evening meal which was served in Hunters Grill was good on the first night and was hot but the second night was exactly the same and generally cold which my boys did not like. The Bar area was nice and the large open fire is very welcoming but the drinks were very expensive in my opinion and the bar staff seemed more interested in what they wanted to do rather than serve customers.Both of the parks were fantastic and as it was out of season there were very short queues. The fast track passes made even the short cues disappear so we did not waste a lot of time at all. There was building work going on and some rides   attractions were closed as mentioned by others but not enough to detract from the experience. I regressed from a 42 year old to a ten year old every day and my nine and ten year old boys loved everything as well. There is such a variety in both parks that there is something for everyone but also most things for everyone. Rides, shows, meet and greets, the list goes on. My son met captain Jack whilst walking around Adventure Land and he was great. He spent several minutes talking to him and interacting with him which made his year (his words). If you go into the parks with the right attitude then you will have a fantastic time. If you want to moan there will always be something to moan about. Some of the staff were a bit rude or seemed to not want to be there but who cares, we did want to be there and they weren't going to stop us from having fun.Disney is one finely tuned engine and on the whole and the entire experience was flawless within the parks.The food is expensive in some areas and in some cases did not seem to cater for our children so the buffets seemed the best choice for us. Sequoia was a bit hit and miss but the main city hall recommended the Parkside Diner at the New York Hotel. The food and service here were great with properly segregated starter, mains and dessert areas. The food was hot and there was plenty of it. It was all you can eat and genuinely was. You were not made to feel awkward for going up several times and you did not need to use the same plate as is the case in some places in the UK. We bought standard plus meal vouchers before we arrived but I am not convinced that we saved money, in fact I think we paid more based on the places we ate.It was very cold and it seemed to go right through you so warm clothes are a must at this time of year. There are plenty of indoor attractions so you do get a chance to warm up so it was not that bad.There was a Mexican restaurant by the Thunder Mountain ride that was reasonable, Mac Donalds was not too much more expensive than usual although it is only there to fill the gap. The restaurant hall to the right as you go in Walt Disney Studios was also reasonable.My kids loved Crush's Roller coaster, Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Stunt Show, Animagique and definitely Stitch Live which was very good although I do not think there there was one ride that they hated. If you like rides then this is the place for you. If you like Disney it is definitely the place for you and if you like fun and variety it is the place for you.I would go again but maybe when it is warmer although then the queues will be longer so this may be the compromise.Take warm clothes, squash for night times, coffee sachets and a travel kettle, basic medicines like calpol, paracetamol and cough medicine as you won't find any on the site.5 days to us was just about the right amount of time as we really had about 4 complete days with train times and booking in and out. We saw everything we want to see and did other attractions several times.Go with the right attitude and none of the negatives will detract from your experience, the holiday was about my boys having a great time which meant we all had a great time.Go with the wrong attitude and maybe you shouldn't be going at all.One last thing which was not relevant to us but I was impressed with was the disabled access and facilities. There are segregated areas for the main attractions including the parade so that disabled guests get a great view and I saw the same disabled man several times at shows and on rides where the staff could not do enough to help him have the time of his life including stopping the rides to help him get in and out of the seats. Well done Disney!",Disneyland_Paris
124104892,3,2012-1,United Kingdom,"Husband and I took our children on a 3 night 4 day trip to DLP in January. Due to work we can't get away in the summer so this was to be our only holiday this year so we wanted to really spoil the children and have a ball.We did have a fabulous family holiday and our children did love the park, but I don't know, I can't quite put my finger on it but it didn't quite live up to the magic you'd expect. I suppose, at the end of the day, it is just a theme park like Alton Towers, etc, but with Disney's branding, but you go expecting something magical and it doesn't quite live up to the advertising there was a lot of building work going on, a lot of rides were closed which wasn't mentioned anywhere so that probably didn't help The park was very quiet when we went so we didn't have to queue much, the longest was 45 minutes for the Princess Pavillion, but the behaviour of some of the other visitors have really put me off going in busier or peak times   the pushing and shoving and queue jumping was bad enough in a 10 minute queue, I'd imagine there are a lot of frayed tempers in August!.The characters were great and were happy to pose for photos and sign autograph books   I even got a kiss from Buzz Lightyear! We enjoyed the rides that were open and my littlest daughter was absolutely struck dumb by the princess castle. Some of the staff were great, some seemed like they were embarrassed to be there, some were just downright rude. Food in the park is ridiculously priced, but we stayed in the Hotel Cheyenne so took food with us and made up a little picnic each day, we also discovered a little shop in the train station where you could buy cans of coke, sandwiches, etc at more reasonable prices. Rainforest Cafe and Cafe Mickey were overpriced for not very nice food, Annette's Diner was good (more reasonably priced and better food), McDonald's is OK (although the restaurant was pretty dirty and the toilets were revolting) but at least I didn't come out feeling like I'd been stitched upDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but I came away feeling a bit ambivalent about it. I doubt we'd go back, we've been there, done it and there was nothing there that would make me want to go again.",Disneyland_Paris
124102809,5,2011-3,United Kingdom,"absolutely loved it. its like your a child again. could go back again and again. great rides, themes. plenty of opportunities for character meet n greets. lots of places to choose from to eat. i am such a big kid and would have to say that my favourite land was fantasyland.",Disneyland_Paris
124075158,3,2012-1,United Kingdom,"I've dreamed of visiting disneyland since I was a little girl and decided last year that it was time to take my kids, my youngest adores Mickey mouse. we booked last August and I noticed it is a lot cheaper to go in January so I rang disneyland and asked what the reason was and to make sure it was all open. They assured me that it would all be open and that it was just cheaper because it is not peak season. I knew it was going to be cold so took lots of clothes to wrap us all up. We arrived at the park on Monday 30th January at around 11am, we picked up a map and park guide and the first thing we noticed was that it said in total for both parks 8 attractions were closed!! ..This was never mentioned when booking!! We went into Disneyland park first and could not get a photo of the pink castle due to green boards and scaffolding...this tended to be theme throughout. we spent most of that first day looking for something that was open we did not find much as even things that were supposed to be open was not! The day ended on a high note with the parade at 5pm which was wonderful!! on the second day we went in Walt Disney Studios Park, this was much better with a lot more open. Animagique was brilliant. Cinemagique, Star n Cars were all good. The stunt show was great but advertised as  featuring lightning mcqueen  we expected a car which looked like lightening but instead it showed a 10 second clip of the movie on a screen behind!! There is only 1 finding Nemo ride and as it is my sons favourite film he couldn't wait to go on it..he is nearly 6 years old although he is only the size of a 4 year old and he was not big enough. then at the end of the day we waited 20 minutes to see the last showing of Stitch live in English. We waited on the side which said English and as we went in the guy confirmed that it was the English show we wanted. We went in only to find it was in French, when the whole grouyp of around 30 people stood and left and told the woman who worked there that we were leaving because we wanted English she looked shocked and just said but this is french!! On the second day we repeated the same as day 2 as the park is not very big and we did it all in one day expet we went past the Hollywood tower of terror and noticed that my youngest who was not big enough to ride the finding nemo ride was plenty big enough to ride this ride so we went on it. I have been on some terrifying rides and this was one of the worse!! My youngest was in complete shock shaking and crying..There is no way a child so small should be allowed on this ride!! how can he be big enough for that but not finding Nemo!! On the 3rd day we went back to the other park to see some of the shows but we waited at the advertised times and saw none. No Rhymes of the jungle at 3.15..we waited 20 minutes. Autopia and other attractions which should have been open were still closed. All in all we feel that even though January is lower price it was still not worth the money. There is more to do in Alton Towers or Blackpool! We were all bored. The only thing that made up for it was my 2 little ones got to meet Mickey, the Animagique and the parades. I am glad that we went in winter as being cold is better than queuing hours for rubbish rides. There were lots of places to eat, lots of disney shops, loads of photo opportunity's so you look to all your friends and family like you had a great time but unfortunately not enough to do, not enough organisation and it certainly lacked magic!!!",Disneyland_Paris
124051405,2,2011-12,United Kingdom,"This was a dream holiday just me and my 6yr old daughter to surprise her at christmas, but we were both so disappointed. I'd booked in advance for the 'enchanted christmas' season. My little girl just wanted to stay in the hotel room and do colouring so that just sums up how poor an experience it was.Flying there was time consuming, the airport at paris was not good, we set off from our home in north west england at 5:30am and arrived at the hotel (seqoia lodge) after 3pm.Sadly we don't speak french so we was not aware of any information about what was at the hotel etc. We ended up going to bed at 8pm that night because there was nothing to do and nowhere to buy any drinks or food! The TV did not work, and the room key was faulty (as many other room key's were too i discovered). Our room was nice enough and had a nice view of the lake, but it was a very long distance from the reception, so this was awful when we couldn't get into the room and had to keep going to reception. I'd advise not to use the mini bar in the room as there are incredible charges for this.Disney village   just shops (all selling the same thing), and eating places (all expensive with big waiting times)Disney park   what an absolute let down!!! we did not see any characters about the park, I paid   75 for my little girl to have dinner with the princesses, the food was awdul and blink and you'll miss what princesses came in! The castle was absolutely beautiful though and this was an absolute credit to disney   this is the only thing my little girl an I liked really. A lot of rides were closed. Santa's village was very poor   we waited in a queue for at least an hour with nothing to amuse the children, there was a post station were kids could write to santa but we found the girl giving them out very rude so didn't bother. You wouldn't have guessed it was christmas   apart from a big tree on main street and a little bit of pretend snow. Fantasyland was the only place with suitable rides for her age, but many were shut and the queues awful. One of the main attractions the pirate boat was shut too. Again all the shops sold exactly the same things in each   not what the guide book siad. The parades were poor   only 2 or 3 floats and we couldn't get anywhere near to really see.Studios park   awful. Getting in the entrance was a trauma in itself there was no organisation at all. Just same shops again, and massive queues for things, the queues were confusing too, you thought you were queueing for one thing then realised it was for something else. We didn't bother staying in. So sadly I was very upset at the experience. firends of mine have been 5 times at christmas although have not been for 5 years   the pictures they have are amazing   characters everywhere, pretend snow falling from roofs at main street when incredible parades where on   this was not the case when we went. So if you're going to go there don't expect too much and you'll have a good time!",Disneyland_Paris

123976595,3,2012-1,United Kingdom,"We visited this park Saturday 28 January and it was VERY busy. We couldn't believe it. We have visited Disney in Florida many times and there is just no comparison. Florida every time!! We got round the parks in Florida in JULY better than we got round the Paris Park. It was very, very cold which didn't help as the  cast  must have been suffering. The thing that struck me was there were inaccurate or no waiting times on the boards at the rides. Thunder Mountain, for instance, had a supposed waiting time on the board of 15 minutes and we went ahead to ride and too late realised we were trapped for an hour! Almost all rides were an hour. Fast passes didn't seem to work too well   possibly because there was only a half hour time slot given whereas in Florida it's an hour   so fast passes had to be moved through it seemed at great cost to the normal queue. The crowd management was not good. We did persevere and got on most of the things but it took all day and we had no time to repeat. It was disappointing as we thought January would be quiet. I can only assume there are a lot of deals going about at the moment which is good news for Disney! We had a deal but I noticed the gate price was 71 euros for an adult   so buy in advance. As has been said, food is very expensive in the Park   about 10 euros we paid for fish and chips. Disney Village is a bit of a letdown. A couple of Disney shops and some very disappointing restaurants. We ate in the Rainforest Cafe. Indifferent food for expensive prices. Also, King Ludwig's is worth avoiding. We were served lukewarm steaks that had been clearly sitting around while we had our starters. Steaks were about 18 euros too. A bottle of wine will set you back that also. It is worthwhile investing in The Unofficial Guide to Disneyland Paris or similar which will give you tips and also information on alternatives to Disney eating. I also agree with the person who said the lighting at night in the Park was terrible. I felt we were picking our way around and it made the whole place look even more miserable. Added to that, they had closed bits and rides for refurbishing so that didn't help the ambience. All in all, I wouldn't rush back.",Disneyland_Paris

123945633,4,2011-12,Australia,"This was our first  Disney  park, and we had a wonderful day. We have been to theme parks in Singapore and Australia, but we found that the Disney versions have rides that are longer and more elaborate. We had just one day, and we went between Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios. Knowing that we were time limited, we had planned out which rides we wanted to go on   these were mostly the thrill rides, and the only one we didn't get time for was Crush's Coaster. The queue for this one was very lengthy. One hint   Disneyland Paris has a smartphone app (also available in Android) which will immediately tell you the current wait time at each attraction. My highlight was the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror   I don't think I ever screamed so much on a ride.The only drawback was that we neglected to plan out what to do about lunch! The eateries at the front of Walt Disney Studios (inside the gate and indoors) were incredibly busy. We waited in line for AGES for what turned out to be very mediocre food. The price was still comparable to other  theme park prices  but the quality was worse (we had burgers). I still shudder when I think about the smeared  slice  of tomato on it. The worst part though was that we could not find a table anywhere (and there were plenty of tables) that wasn't occupied. We ended up eating standing up with our tray propped obnoxiously on the sauce serviette station. The lining up and eating made for an uncomfortable forty minutes or so. I think this may have been a different experience if we had of done a bit of restaurant research beforehand.Other than that, we have very fond memories of our Disneyland visit.

The weather is colder and you are more likely to get rain but the plus size is you get so much ore done in January. the queues are either small or there are no queues. dumbo was a 5 minute queue. the big thunder mountain was a 10 minute queue most of the time. and even space mission 2 was only 10 minutes. we loved being able to get on everything so easy.

123830325,4,2012-1,United Kingdom,"It's really quite simple   Disney is a theme park, no more no less. It has big rides and small rides, thrill rides and gentle rides. It gets insanely busy, even when it's cold (and boy was it cold), refreshements are expensive and the whole place is designed to make it easy to spend money. Once you realise all that, it's absolutely great. We (14 leaders ranging from 14 through to 'approaching 60') took 23 Brownies (aged 7 10) from different Packs for a long weekend. My group of girls consisited mainly of the thrill seekers. It is really important that you check out the height restrictions properly and don't just assume small children will get through. It really is a safety issue and it's hard enough for little one's that want to go on to be turned down   if they get right through the queue they can still get turned away at the door if the second checker isn't happy (and they are much stricter closer to the actual ride) tears all round! There are still plenty of good rides with lower height restrictions and lots of fun stuff that has no restriction at all. Good fun is the Big Thunder Mountain ride which will give the inexperienced rider their 1st go at a roller coaster. Nothing too severe as far as drops are concerned, but a good deal of speed. Crush's coaster also takes little ones, but be warned, this is far more 'hardcore' that it may appear. It is a beautiful ride but the drops and twists are much more extreme. It also has the longest queue, always. You can't use a fast pass for it either, so get there very early or be prepared to wait more than an hour and a half. Despite making it our first ride of the day, our brownies had to survive a 90 minute wait, but they all agreed it was worth it   as did the adventurous leaders amongst us tasked with the job of doing all the rides. It is good if someone can stay off and hold bags for you, but it's a dull job when quese are long and it's cold. How many coffees and teas can you drink? Taking bags on means ensuring that they are properly secured inside the cars as you get spun about, so take a bag that zips securely as things can fall out. All our little one's passed the height test for the Rocking Roller Coaster. For me this is the fastest and best thrill ride, in the dark with Aerosmith blasting at you. All the girls loved it too, but they are a wild bunch. The Tower of Terror caused the most fear. It's a severe skydrop with a ghostly story to set the scene. Anyway, if you love rides you'll try them all. Get fast passes if you can and plan your route around the parks to get the best out of your day. Food is very expensive. We had vouchers for fast food on our second day, and with a large group it was a nightmare. We couldn't sit together, the choice was very restricted and didn't include a vegetarian option (our Veggie girls ended up getting a cheeseburger without the patty   salad in a bap!). It was also difficult for the staff to get a large order right, they still failed after three attempts, but we'd given up by then and 'lumped it'. The buffect option at Plaza Gardens is much more expensive, but far more civilised and better quality. Book ahead! It's also worth booking the Character breakfast. Early morning with Mickey or Goofy or whoever else shows up. The food is good too, with the choice of full cooked, continental, cereal, fruit or all of it if you are so inclined. Currently there's no late Parade (until April), but in the colder months that's not such a bad thing. It really is too cold to stand around for the length of time you need to once the sun has gone in.OK so this place is colder than Florida or California and much smaller, but as it's so near to the UK it's just the right size for a great weekend break. Kids love it and even Brown Owls can have fun on the Buzz Lightyear ride. Everyone should experience the pain that is Small World at least once in their life, you will never get that tune out of your head afterwards. The pain in your wallet won't then feel so bad.",Disneyland_Paris

You can pay for the hotel buffets   but it doesn't come cheap.I had heard about the shopping centre at Marne La Vallee and had intended to go to the supermarket there to equip ourselves with food for during the day. However, when we got there we realised that this wasn't really feasible due to three of the children being 3 and under. I think this is more practical if you have 1. a car 2. older children. To get to the shopping centre you either need to go via the bus terminal by the disney parks or arrange for transport from the disney hotels, this is not cheap and therefore would probably erode the saving you make by eating there in the first place.We did, sadly, end up doing what a lot of other people appear to do . . and that is fill up and breakfast and take a breakfast doggy bag into the park. HOWEVER. . .I have a little tip which we didn't come across until we were on the way home. In the train station there is a shop which sells, bags of crisps, bottles of drink, sandwiches, loaves of bread, ham, cheese, biscuits .. and this would definitely work out cheaper than the fast food outlets in the park. It wasn't immediately obvious .. you can't expect to walk through the station and find it. . it was a little bit out of the way. . and therefore not immediately in view.. . .but do get ready to spend a few days of eating rubbish   when I say rubbish   I mean hotdogs, pizza, chips, burgers. . .I think I must have a looked like a piece of fast food after 3 days.",Disneyland_Paris

123452930,4,2011-7,United Kingdom,i really enjoyed my trip to disneyland. i went with school so i was with all my friends.when i went it was poring it down but thats obviously not the parks faultmy complaints would be that the rides are in groups of about 5 and then quite far away from each other and also they could do with a bit more shelter as there was nowhere to stand under shelter and our only map melted!the rides we went on were awesome space mountain is really good so we went on it twice and tower of terror is amazing although DO NOT go on your phone in the middle of the ride as it messes with the brakes and goes up and down really fast (someone from my school went on their phone)though the queue for the its a small world ride was very long and broke down without us noing and my friends were right at the front and was very hard to find as we didnt have a map and there was nowhere to get one which was SO anoying but extreeeeeeeemely good trip but going to alton towers instead this year!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Disneyland_Paris

123280908,4,2011-12,Singapore,"We visited Paris disneyland in Dec 2011, Disneyland is always Disneyland, beautiful and magical , no matter which country you visit, the difference is only in the language. My advice for tourists are to purchase the tickets online ( where there is a discount ) or using the Paris Viste ticket to purchase on the counter where discount is provided. Otherwise the tickets for walk in can be expensive, Adult is     71.00 and Child     64.00, for a single day pass for 2 parks ( including Walt Disney Studio).My understanding is the the locals ( French) got a even better discount from the tickets. So do your homework to get a good price. Overall, nice experience, not overly crowded . We need not use the fastpass at all during this period. With Christmas theme in the Disneyland, it is really special !",Disneyland_Paris

Yes   we went during the British School Half Term week plus it was also Halloween weekend, but when you cannot even walk around the park there is something wrong with management for not limiting admission numbers. 2 to 3 hour lines for 2 minute rides had young children in tears everywhere.

It could be great, but it just isn't.Transportation to the park is very good, with a train station right on the doorstep. The Disney market place area isn't very nice at all.

Prior to arrival we had booked tea with the characters. This proved to be a very memorable occasion, with lots of characters coming around to your tables and having lots of fun with the children.The evening Fantillusion parade was something to be remembered forever, however, on other visits this was followed with fireworks which seem to no longer happen.After a long first day we returned to the New York hotel for a good nights sleep.Up early to enjoy our day, visited the Walt Disney studios and more rides in the park.The dream parade was scheduled for 5pm, so we thought this would be a great end to our trip as the Eurostar was due to leave at 6pm.We found a spot at the top of Main Street to wait for the parade which had still not started at 5.20pm. We decided to head for the Eurostar as the parade was never going to get to us in time. As this was only a one night visit we had planned our trip so that the parade would be a great finale to our visit.

122758569,4,2011-12,United Kingdom,"Many reviewers seem to have the wrong idea about Disney, how to make the most of it, and who it is aimed at.Lets start with that   Disney is aimed at all ages. Many adults go without kids,  I know people who had their honeymoon there . Young kids will not get as much out of it ! I would seriously recommend that you don   t take children under 6. They hate queuing! Many times I have watched as families have queued for 30 mins only for the youngest to want the toilet just as they approach the head of the queue. There are not many rides suitable for the very young.   Even Snow White is quite scary  Yes they probably enjoy meeting the characters but even then there are big queues, and the characters can be scary to little ones.The shows and parades are probably the best thing for the real youngsters, but it is difficult to get a good view unless you claim your position well in advance, and defend it vigorously. I have seen people dragging their kids through the 15 deep crowds as the parade starts trying in vain to find somewhere that they can watch the parade. This is actually the best time to go on the more popular rides, as the queues will be much smaller.My first visit was Christmas Day 2005, and we managed 16 rides that day  although no shows and parades , and have used this as a benchmark ever since. We have discovered since that this is a quieter day  presumably fewer day visitors?  . Avoid weekends where possible, and make use of Extra Magic Hours if staying at a qualifying hotel. On our visit just before Christmas 2011, we used the extra hours  8am  on Saturday morning. There are only a few rides open, but we managed five rides in the first hour, just walking straight on each one!Make the most of Fast Pass   some rides are so popular that it   s the only way to ride them  Peter Pan is one that springs to mind . I see one reviewer complained that you have to return in 5 hours   well I   d rather come back then and wait only a few minutes than stand in line for 30 60 90 minutes when I could be doing something else.Save the walk through attractions  which rarely have a wait  for the busy times. Each    land    has at least one. Ride the popular rides early or late in the day. Often in the evenings you can walk on many rides with hardly any queuing. Disney manage the queues well, so often you do not realise when you join the start just how long the wait is, and having waited 10 minutes, you do not want to leave. We have found the waiting time boards to be a reasonable indication but don   t expect 100% accuracy   its not possible.Another reviewer complained that rides were often out of action or breaking down. You can check in advance if any areas are closed for routine maintenance on the web. On our last visit the Swiss Family Robinson Tree house was advertised as closed but reopening during our stay. It reopened bang on schedule! Some rides are continuous loading  they do not stop   you get on while they are still moving  Buzz Lightyear and Phantom Manor are examples. This speeds up waiting time but they have to stop to enable the less mobile to get on, from time to time. Just be patient. Obviously some rides may develop a problem, and be shut at short notice, and outside rides because of the weather   we were once moved out of the swimming pool at Sequoia Lodge because of a thunderstorm! . It is frustrating but watch out for these rides reopening and walk straight on. On our last visit parts of the park were shut until afternoon because of ice on the footpaths   it was very cold!Plan you visit in advance. Choose the rides you can   t miss, and use Fast Pass or early or late evening hours to do the popular rides Don   t try to do the whole park in one day   it can   t be done! To see all shows & parades and do all the rides I reckon you need 3 days just for Disneyland Park   extra day for Studios . Stay on site if you can   I have done both, but its far better on site with plenty to do day and night. The whole resort is an overall experience. Yes, it can be expensive, but if you can   t afford it save up until you can. We stayed at Newport Bay last time  see hotel review  4 nights so got park tickets for 5 days. To buy these separately would be E200 each, so actually makes hotel more reasonable.Don   t go expecting to be able to do it on a budget but there are ways to save. Drinks really add up during your stay, especially with meals   can be 30% of the bill!  Buy drinks at shop in railway station   refill water bottles from drinking fountains in park. Just have one drink with meals.All Park eateries are expensive! But you don   t have to have a full meal every day. Full meal is around E25   30 each   less for children , but you can grab a bite at McDonalds or Earl of Sandwich for less than E10! You can also just have a main course, then buy a cake or ice cream later. Avoid eating during busy times or book in advance, although not all restaurants take bookings. Disney have a centralised booking system which only applies to their own restaurants   you cannot book Rainforest caf  , for example. We don   t do character dining but it is popular so you will have to book  and pay!  for this. We ate in Beaver Creek one night which had buffet starters and desserts, menu for main course. A quick look at the buffet choice, and we decided that we would save the few Euros and skip the starter, and then really pig out on the desserts! My son managed 6 different desserts!Massive queues to get through    security    before you get to park gate. Here they only check your bags   if you don   t have a bag, take in what you like! Park gates were opened early every day we were there, but non residents were then stopped from entering areas where rides were open early. They could and did start queuing for most popular rides in other areas.I read some reviews complaining about vermin in the parks and hotels. I only saw one rat during our visit. It was outside the entrance to the main Park, in the gardens near the fountain, and disappeared immediately into the undergrowth. I don   t believe that Disneyland Paris can be held to account over the wildlife, which will appear wherever large volumes of people leave enough for them to eat. The place is kept clean, and you see people sweeping up rubbish all over the place. However you also see guests feeding the birds whilst queuing for rides, and this will attract vermin. How can you stop people feeding birds?This Park is not operated by Disney itself, but by a company set up just for this park. I have not visited any other Disney parks to compare, but I DO like this place. The attention to detail is extraordinary!   stand outside the barbers and listen to the tap dancing lesson taking place upstairs in the dance studio . But there are faults and problems   we can see differences now since our first visit. Only minor things no longer working   presumably why they have not been fixed. Its still great fun, and worth a visit.",Disneyland_Paris
122714009,4,2012-1,United States,"Having visited Disneyland on numerous previous occassions I was surprised at how busy the park was this time (maybe it was because it was just after New Year) and how much pushing went on. We went with friends who had never been before   it was great to see things through their eyes. The parades were just as good as ever. Since our last visit the Park has been updated in several places. Although it was very busy we still managed to get on everything we wanted, especially if you go when the parades are on. We used our annual passes as much as we could it was good to get the discounts on food and drink and gifts. We will definitely go back   hope fully later this year.",Disneyland_Paris

I expected large crowds but the queues for everything from the rides, to the food outlets, toilets, tickets, left luggage was so tiring and endlessly frustrating that my 7 year old grand daughter started to say, well that will be 60 mins of my life I wont get back! Even the fast track ticket system failed to deliver with rides breaking down and a faulty magnetic strip. Many of the shows attractions where we thought there would be chance to give the legs a rest, you could not enjoy because they were designed for standing only giving a very restricted view for both children and adults. eg Peter Pan Show, and others were only memorable by our aching muscles. However the Parades continue to deliver the disney magic but the park itself was a huge disappointment.",Disneyland_Paris
122613713,5,2011-11,Belgium,"First thing you always hear about it is that it's so expensive. Agreed, one day tickets are expensive, but just look at the package deals they offer including sleeping in a Disney hotel, access to both Disneyland Parc and Studios and breakfast included, it's well worth the price and looking at the room rates, you've almost got your access for free!We've been 3 times now: Once in august 2009 (first time, unforgettable!), November 2010 and November 2011. Last time was the least 'cause of the queues. it was really crowded while the first two visits it was surprisingly calm.Food on site really is not that expensive, drinks are tough but that's something you'll have everywhere in France. You pay more for a bottle of fanta then you do for a hamburger and French fries together. There lots of variety too, going from fast food (hot dogs, burgers and sandwiches) to table service restaurants or buffets with oriental, Italian, Tex mex, BBQ of French kitchen style food. Definitely something available for every taste and budget.Summer fireworks are amazing, and the park is so beautiful in the dark during the late opening hours. Fantilusion is wonderfull to see to! Both times in November were during Christmas season, sooo worth the cold!The tree and decorations are incredible. I bought enough christmas ornaments to fill twenty trees in the shops. Bring enough budget 'cause you won't know where to look or what to buy first in the souvenirshops. There are so many, gorgeous things available to bring home.The queus weren't so bad first and second time, about 20 minutes max. Try going from monday   friday and avoid saterday sunday and you won't have to wait long.Don't run from attraction to attraction and go see the shows and parades as well, you'll mis out on a lot of magic if you don't. The vibe and atmosfere there are indescribable, you really feel as if you're in a different world. It's just somewhere you have to go at least one in your life. Don't hesitate, just go!",Disneyland_Paris
122581294,2,2012-1,United Kingdom,"Hugely disappointing. Very poor relative of Disney World Florida. In fact on the face of it, the park seems like an imposter. Gone is the wow factor, the oohs and aahs from the children. Most of the staff seem to hate their jobs, with smiles being hard to come by. One or two staff members go out of their way to be pleasant and helpful in true Disney style. The facilities are extreme. Food wise the restaurants are the most extortionately expensive I have ever come across. The cheapest for a family of two adults and two children is lunch for   100  Cinderella's Castle dinner would have cost a total of   415!!!!The toilets are an utter disgrace. In the two full days we spent at the park we did not see one single toilet attendant. It was typical to see excrement smeared across the toilet seat. If this is the standard French people are used to, they must be walking health hazards.Our visit on New Year's Eve included a 'spectacular' firework display at the stroke of midnight. It seemed a good idea to let the New Year in with a bang   what was provided was more of a fizzle than a bang. None of the signature cascading colourful display, just single shooting coloured rockets fizzling to nothing.Considering the onsite charges for food etc it is an utter disgrace that the park is not better maintained. Rides frequently broke down. We went on Buzz Lightyear 3 times and it broke down at least twice each time. Health and Safety appears to be non existent. At nightfall the park becomes a nightmare to traverse with very sparse lighting, cracked walkways galore, unmarked hazards such as very low fences, rockeries and slippery floors. Even the travelator to the car parks turned into a skating rink!!!It would be interesting to know how many visitors return home injured or with infections, food poisoning etc.A final tip: Disney Village has an excellent MacDonald's restaurant (normally one of my pet hates) they do not hike up their prices. We had 2 happy meals and 2 adults meals for less than   20   an absolute bargain by Disneyland Paris standards. Also they have an incredibly efficient touch screen ordering facility where you can order and pay by card. By the time you are finished paying your meal is ready for collection. Go off peak time as it gets very busy. Easier to find a seat then. Staff struggle to keep up with clearing tables but at least the toilets are cleaner than the Disney parks.",Disneyland_Paris
122566235,5,2011-12,United Kingdom,"Last time we visited Disneyland Paris was in 2008. We travelled by plane and stayed at the Disneyland Hotel. This time we went for Christmas 2011, travelled by EuroStar and again booked into the DisneyLand HotelI learn life lessons quickly and travelling to DisneyLand from the UK via the Eurostar was one of those valued lessons learned from our experiences at the god awful charles du gaulle in 2008.What an fantastic way to travel to a fantastic hotel and park. Stress free, quick and quiet, no queuing, no hanging around in lounges, no waiting for bags to be thrown off the airplane.The train practically stops in the Hotel carpark. We used the Disney Express service so left our bags at the train station and marvelled as they magically appeared in room later. The rooms in the hotel are lovely. No coffee making facilities though. The Hotel is as you'd expect, lovely but a little more expensive. 4 Euro for a packet of crisps in the Piano bar. Evening meal for 2 adults and 2 kids   185.00. The Breakfast Is very comprehensive covering the requirements of all nationalities. Best meal of the day. Hotel Staff are fantastic with the kids and polite to the adults. Disney Characters are around everyday and happy to have photos and sign books. We took advantage of our Fast Passes (Super Special ones with Disneyland Hotel) as well as the extra hours access to the park. The out of hours access was worth it's weight in gold as by the end of the last parade most folk left leaving the park an empty playground. We were walking on the main rides with ease.As with all Parks the rides have some hight restrictions. My 3yr old boy was turned away quite a lot being only a hair higher than 1 .1 meters.Plenty of places to eat most of which are pricey for theme park food. 30 euro for a   12 McDonalds gives you an idea (plus you have to wait 20 mins in a queue)Going by train means no weight restrictions. We took lots of snacks and drink for the daytime and some bottles of wine for the evening in the room when the kids are asleep.I don't have any negatives about the hotel, it's lovely and without doubt worth the extra. It's worth mentioning that the Park gets busy at the weekend as the locals attend   and attend with attitude. They are rude, don't know how to queue and give off the impression that we have just walked though an open front door to their home. Go for 4 nights , 5 days. If you can, do it mid week, if not get there Thursday, leave on Monday.Rude French families aside, a great and easily commutable destination. Go by train (walk on walk off) pay the extra for the DisneyLand Hotel and use their park privileges.",Disneyland_Paris
122565675,2,2011-12,Canada,"The French, with their well earned criticism for being rude, arrogant and unhelpfull, were to me, always unhappy bedfellows with Disney, a charming, warm, welcoming and entertaining company.

122540983,5,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Myself and my partner visited Disneyland on a weekend trip to Paris in October 2011 :) this was a last minute thing... We hopped on a train from Gare Du Nord which took approximately 40 minutes. We decided we wanted entrance to the main park and Universal Studios which was 75E each! Pretty good really :) (you can get it cheaper if you book in advance online and they send you the ticket). The cashier told us that the Universal Studios closed at 7.30pm so we had plenty of time to see and do everything. First I'll start with the main park....There are 3 sections... we spent most of our time in one section, going on all of the rides and eating in a nice cafe, etc. There are some good (and some scary :) ) rides there.. (it is the left section on the map). The Haunted House was good and so were the rides next to it (cant remember the names, sorry   one looks like a volcano, that was a scary ride haha).There was a show in the centre, by the pink princess castle, which was quite good :) it was the evil characters in the shows. Then we went to Universal Studios and went on the rides there... they were awesome! We went on the Hollywood Tower (took me a lot of pursuading my boyfriend to come on that with me lol) which is like a lift that goes crazy, dropping and all   this took over an hour to queue for but well worth it :) We also went on Space Mountain   this was AWESOME!!!! Highly recommended! So fun and didnt have to queue as it was about to close!We went on some of the other rides here too which were fab, but cant remember names, sorry. We also went on the tour... this is a cart thing that takes you round a 'Hollywood set'   so realistic. And they do some special effects aswell. This was incredible! Overall, Disneyland Paris is well worth the visit and well worth the money! I cant recommend this place highly enough... I want to go back! :)",Disneyland_Paris

122464026,4,2011-12,United Kingdom,"Fantastic rides, theming, the park itself is incredible and even on the extremely busy days we visited we did pretty much everything twice through good planning!Downside   Lots of queue jumping, I had a fall out with a French couple who were barging their way through the queue, once we got to the front I notified a cast member who didn't seem to care, I think this needs addressing, most uk theme parks throw queue jumpers out.All in all though, a magical day out and brilliant time of year to visit with riding rides at night and general christmas themeing.",Disneyland_Paris

122335342,4,2011-12,United Kingdom,"We spent four days at Disneyland Paris with our 3 and half year old son over Decembe Christmas. We stayed at the Magic Circus hotel. Great quality hotel with very clean and bright rooms. Breakfast was very nice with lots to choose from and set you up for the day. We thought the hotel was to a far better standard to the Disney hotels (previously stayed at the Sequioa). The disney parks are great, amazing detail, endless things to see and so. The negative has to be two things 1). The french staff mostly struggle to smile or sometimes even speak 2). The food is very over priced and low medium quality. If you have experienced USA service, you will find Disneyland Paris a big disapointment. If you can cope with some un intersted staff and focus on the splendor of the Disney experience you will have a great time. Tip for food   go to Supermarket at Disney train station for snacks etc or even eat at McDonalds.",Disneyland_Paris

122316018,1,2011-12,United Kingdom,"We visited disneyland during december of this year, we weren't very happy. First of all we arrived the disney new york hotel, It was just a normal bog standard hotel with no disney touch on it. There were large queues to check in, and I would have thought that the disney characters would be entertaining the kids and welcoming them upon there arrival but they didn't. When we were done checking in we arrived in a poorly themed room that looked nothing like 'New York' at all or had that amazing disney theme to it. It wasn't amazing like made out to be on its website. The room wasn't clean, the bathroom had dirt on the floor when we arrived. Me and my brothers and sisters who are below the ages of 10 7 wanted to go on the rides, but much to our fears the place was packed. Disneyland Paris should have a sense to limit the number of people they have in the park at one time. But they kept on letting people in. So we thought just line up for something so we queued up for big thunder mountain, it was freezing cold and wet. And my aunt who plucked up the courage to get on the ride went on with us. The ride started of fine for a couple of seconds but then as our train got to the very top of the lift hill, the ride stopped the train was almost vertical it was very hard to get out as there was a big gap and it was trouble to get out of the car. We were very unhappy. My aunt now will not go on a roller coaster again because of what had happened she was very upset. The staff got us off quickly but going down the stairs was very tricky in the dark and wet conditions. We were furious we wasted 2 hours of queueing up. We surely thought they would offer compensation to us like lots of other theme parks do, but they didn't. That ride then broke down all the other times that we were there too. We went to cafe mickey. The service was very very poor. The food was horrible and the price was very hefty. It took us an hour just to get bread on our table. But they did a kind thing and gave us a free garlic bread for saying sorry after we complained. We then visited Planet Hollywood and Anntets diner in the disney village. They had service with a smile the food came very very quickly. Everyone was happy with there service. The staff at disneyland were rude and unhelpful. I asked where this and that was but they just nodded and walked away. And the staff on the rides didn't have any sense of humour or magic about them as advertised by disney. The place was very expensive too. All the rides we queued for broke down once and they just told people to leave without saying sorry or anything. A complete waste of time. The studio backlot tour was absolute rubbish too we queued for an hour just to see one 'alright' set. But the rides were fantastically themed and out of this world but a shame when they broke down and had a large queue. But I wouldn't be prepared to queue for a couple of hours. Yes they have fast passes but they don't really make a difference. I would rate this attraction very poorly. Visit UNIVERSAL STUDIOS instead of any disney parks. We visited universal studios in hollywood and it was amazing. The rides were empty and amazing, they have lots of characters walking around the park unlike disneyland. and they have amazing shows. I would highly recommend universal studios to anyone. It beats disneyland by a 10000 miles. The rides didn't break down once and we went for a week to universal the hotels are amazing there. We visited disney for 3 days and every ride broke down we went on. Very Poor Very Poor disney. The loading staff took there time loading the rides and they were very inefficient. Do not visit.",Disneyland_Paris
122299147,5,2011-12,United Kingdom,"Loved Disney park in the winter. Snow machines, great parades, very very christmassy!Didn't get round all the attractions in the 3 days we were there but that just means we will have to go back :DThe ride time advice is pretty spot on. Never waited longer than suggested & often got in quicker. The fast passes for hotel residents were great & did save time. Was also good to go earlier than the general public & get an extra 2 hours in the park, this did half the normal queue time i think.All the staff we spoke to were pleasant and spoke english without us asking them to. Food is ridiculously priced in some area's but we chose wisely before arriving & took plenty of snacks.Would definitely visit again, but suggest at least 4 days to get round both parks",Disneyland_Paris
122247777,4,2011-12,United States,"This was a surprise Christmas present for my daughter as she has been desperate to go to Disney for a long time. We told her xmas day and flew out boxing day, so as you can expect she was very excited. The place itself is beautiful and magical, the parades are amazing but the queue's do take the edge of it when nearly every ride is is over an hour long, which is not good at this time of year because it is bitterly cold! We did use the fast passes a couple of times and these are a great idea but only a few of the big rides have them and most of them were no good for my daughter as had height restrictions. If your going at this time of year then do take your thermals as it is really really cold. The parades are amazing but get there early and stand right at the edge of the curb, don't make the mistake we did and get there early only for people to push right in front and end up not being able to see a thing! Very disappointing for my excited 6yr old. Also watch out for the pushy parents when the characters do walk abouts. I   ve not seen anything like it, parents actually pushing their kids forward at the characters and knocking other kids out of the way just so they can get a photo   really unbelievable. Of the rides we went on, would recommend a small world, peter pans flight (use the fast passes for this) and the hollywood tower of terror in the studio park, if your stomach can stand it! The food is all junk food basically; burger and chips on nearly every menu...ok for a couple of days but couldn   t hack it for much more than this. In a nutshell...magical place but if your going at this time of year make sure you have plenty of warm clothes, be prepared to queue and get there early to see the parades, stand right at the edge of the curb and get your elbows ready to defend your space...manors are non existent I'm afraid!",Disneyland_Paris

122105335,5,2011-12,United States,"We went the week before Christmas, and it was decked out! You walk in, and a huge Christmas tree all decorated and Main Street USA all decorated, made me remember my home town in the States. My son is 6 years old, and 50  tall. The only ride he could not go on was Space Mountain 2. Our favorite rides were: Star Tours, Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast, Orbitor, Peter Pan's Flight, Big Thunder Mountain (by far the best!!), Pirates of the Caribean, Dumbo and of course the Tea Cups!! My 23 month old got to ride most of them. I love the baby switch system they have. So my hubby would take my son through the line and get a ticket, so when he would exit he would give me the ticket and I would get it to the attendant at the Exit and they would walk me up to the ride and I could get on the next one! So I didn't have to wait in the line at all! Plus, we got a fast pass for the Buzz Lightyear ride and the Peter Pan (although you can't get more than 1 fast pass at a time). We did all the parades and shows the first day, so the next 2 days we could ride the rides when everyone was at the parade and the lines were short. We ate at the Garden Buffet Restaurant and it was delicious, but I think we got better food from the little stands around the park. The bathrooms were nice and clean and warm!! I would definitely love to go back!!",Disneyland_Paris

The place was run down and many of our favourite rides were closed. When we attempted to take a second ride at Spacemountain, it broke down! At Buzzlightyears, our ride was also interrupted and stopped several times.Unlike other disneylands which we've visited in LA, Tokyo, Hong Kong, we did not feel the disney atmosphere. The staff generally looked jaded and uninterested. There were no parade and we did not see a single mascot at all, hence no photos!Then when we needed a quick bite, not a single hotdog or drinks kiosk were opened (except popcons). We left well before the closing time which was not the norm for us, feeling very very disappointed. The only consolation was we didn't pay the full price thru fnac.",Disneyland_Paris
122066645,3,2011-12,United Kingdom,"Spent a cold weekend here staying at the Newport Bay Hotel with my partner and six year old child.Hotel was fairly decent, having read other reviews I was pessimistic but we stayed on the admiral's floor of this massive hotel and it had all that you'd want. Rooms were clean and had a old style T.V with limited channels, but you're not there to watch Telly. Beds were comfortable and rooms were quiet, views were nothing special. Breakfast in morning was busy but acceptable, aim for between half 7 and 8 or expect a queue.Because we stayed in a disney hotel, we got early access to park, but check with reception to see which rides will open early (not that many). Free shuttle from hotel to park is a godsend.The queues for rides were horrific even in the cold, between 40 60 minutes for the good stuff and with kids in tow this can be a bit of a drain. Again if you're lucky enough to stay in the hotels you can get access to FastPass which shortens queues if you're prepared to come back at a given time to ride.Food is average, but on the expensive side but they have you over a barrell on that one. Making reservations for restaurants didn't really make much difference because there were plenty of eateries dotted around.Bit disappointed that there weren't more chracters wandering around to take pictures with and the lines for possible photo opportunities were quite long.Overall, plan plan plan and fastpass!!",Disneyland_Paris
122007629,4,2011-7,United States,"I have always loved Disneyland since i was kid, even Disney World. So my family booked a trip to Paris for the summer and i said  hey theres a Disney park about an hour away, lets go . We arrive on a Wednesday and the park is so so crowded. The park itself is more spread out, so less crowding in areas, but it uses almost the same layout as Disneyland Anahiem. The theme rides are a bit darker (mood wise) like the phantom manor (a great rendition of the haunted mansion) and i love how thunder mountain is where Tom Sayers island is (you go under the lake to get there). As an added plus each worker spoke multiple languages from Spanish to English to Arabic (lots of middle easterns go there) So many good rides, but its now time for the negative. 1 France is a very heavily smoking country place, and there were no rules that banned smoking in the park. 2 Its not very handicap friendly, each ride queue has a ridiculous amount of stairs but no ramps of any kind 3 THE STAIRS!!! like in 2, each ride has you go up and down and all around just to get to the ride cars, thats ok on a busy day since it diverts most  traffic  but since it was a so so day i was also getting a work out just to get on the rides. But despite those 3 negative things its a very fun park and would greatly recommend going if you are a disney fan and just happen to be going to france",Disneyland_Paris

The grilled meat bbq restaurant in Frontierland is bad so do not go their. They look like they boil their chicken and do not even freshly grill their ribs. Took us over 1.5 hour to get out of there.Buzz lightyear ride was sad with just red laserpointers, not as cool as the one in Anaheim.",Disneyland_Paris

The park looks very worn out and the rides keep breaking down. We had 6 stops on one ride alone for  technical problems . The new attractions were having  technical problems  most days. We were there for 5 days and there were rides not working on all the days in both parks. We were not able to get on the Crusher ride, my sons favourite, as this broke down at least three times a day! He was very upset as we could not ride this as the queues when it did work were 90 mins long. The parades were non existent, there used to be 3 parades a day and lots of Christmas cheer, now you get 1 in each park and only 6 floats! The dancers were a troop but now you get a couple dancing only! The Christmas decorations were sparse to say the least; the lack of Disney characters was very noticeable as they only came out for the photo shoots etc but no interaction or fun. The costs have grown and you should expect to pay top prices for the cheapest quality. Restaurants in the village as well as the park are not delivering any service and the cost of a family of 4 with a 2 course meal will set you back 120 Euros. The staffs looked unhappy and have no Christmas additions to their uniforms, no Santa hats or tinsel or any reference to Christmas at all!

There are great rides that even I enjoyed. opening hours were spotty during our visit, with an early close on our first day. Food obviously is pricey, so may make sense to stock up on brie and baquette before entering. Wear sturdy shoes, and get ready for some waiting, and times indicated may be on the short side. Fast pass options are available on certain rides, which offer great reductions on waiting times.

The Park itself is kept spotless and the staff helpful and friendly....But BEWARE it is very expensive....3 large bags of crisps   10!!!!!.

I would still say, you must go!",Disneyland_Paris
121655847,4,2011-12,United Kingdom,"We stayed at the S Lodge from Thursday to sunday. The first two days were definatley the quietest, so try and go in the week if you can. The weekend was spent in the studios and relaxing in the hotel and evening in the park itself. Disney at night is great and the park is transformed into a whole different world. Annettes Diner was great   the best meal we had there. Pizza planet was a bit of a let down, there was little options of pizza topping and none of them had chicken   my husband was not impressed. However the kids liked the food and there was a nice play area, so we did end up spending a couple of hours there. The price of food was rediculous and it was a shame everything cost so much. As we stayed for four days, i was expecting a few small freebies for the kids   nothing everything had to be paid for. If you can try and buy your bits on the last day, otherwise you may overspend. We did that and let the kids buy anything (within reason ) on the last day. Localtion wise the lodge was perfect   within 5 mins we were in the village and kids enjoyed the walk around the lake. The ammoying things was the amount of time spent queing!   this dd get beyond a joke   so try and fasttrack if you can. Although if you have small children there is plenty to keep the kids busy!Dont miss small world, buzz laser ride, train ride around the park, car stunt show and the parades   they are great and get everyone dancing!In all we spent   100 a day so   400 for the four days including gifts. We used to take rolls from the hotel to tie us over lunch and then a early dinner at 5 ish   that way you beat the ques as well! Try and take plenty of snacks with you and much on these will your waiting for rides, this keeps the kids occupied as well.We used to head out early and then come back to the hotwl for a rest and go back out again in the evening. Perfect if your staying in one of the hotels. Final point   take a pram   even if you think your kids ahve outgrown them!",Disneyland_Paris
121653715,3,2011-5,United Kingdom,"Disneyland Paris it's a fantastic place, very very fun!!!! The staff at the park (except for the person who served us at guest services). I read a review here about the terrible staff, but I have to disagree. Most of the people we encountered gave us personal service, very much above and beyond the quality of service I would have expected.",Disneyland_Paris

121620684,5,2011-11,United Kingdom,"I went to Disneyland Paris with my 6 year old daughter at the end of November for an extended weekend. I felt 6 years was just the right age to go, as she still believes in magic, can already go on most rides and will remember it. Best days were Friday and Monday when we managed to avoid most queues and enjoy the best view of the parades. We found the best place to watch the parade in Disneypark was by the Little World. Overall is was a fantastic trip and I would definitely recommend going at this time of year. We have been very lucky with the sunny weather though. With the whole park decorated for Chrismas it really puts you into the festive mood. Four days may be a little too much to spend in the parks. We spent half a day in Paris which is just 30 minutes train ride away. Having a Disney package really helps you enjoy the stay. Our bags were taken from us at the station and delivered to the hotel. As the station is just outside the park entrance you can go straight in. Also if you stay in one of Disney hotels you can go to the park 2 hours before the crowds. We only used this once, as most rides are closed this early anyway. The hotel (Santa Fe) was ok, but it is 2 stars so you can't really expect much. It's clean and the food is ok, but quite boring. We didn't intend to spend much time in the hotel, so it was not important really.We had dinner in the hotel once. It wasn't bad but not good enough to want to repeat. I was quite surprised to find decent food in the park. The restaurant I liked most was one on the main square opposite the castle by the annual ticket information office. It is a little pricey (35 Euros for one adult and one child), but was worth it. You get a buffet with a lot of choice and the food was fantastic. Another benefit of going outside of school holidays   weekend is that you never need to reserve a seat.Otherwise we took bread rolls and croissants from breakfast to have for lunch. Also I brought fruits, biscuits and other snacks from home. It helps having snacks for queueing, even if it's only for 20 minutes or so. I also thought of some games my daughter would enjoy playing in the queue and made sure I had a pen and paper. The rides I would definitely recommend are: Peter Pan Flight, Manor House, Tram in Disney Studios and Pirates of the Caribbean. I didn't think the train in Disneypark was really worth queueing for. For some reason there are always really long queues for it, but it's not that exciting. We also enjoyed all the shows. Overall I was impressed with the park   it is well organised, the staff are always friendly, helpful and speak decent English and the toilets are clean. Queueing   crowds may be a bit of a problem in season.",Disneyland_Paris
121592033,4,2011-11,United Kingdom,"Good fun!We did Walt Disney studios as well, and the rides there were obviously a bit newer. The rides here are a bit less smooth but still some fun ones. There were literally no queues, we walked straight onto everything which was great and meant we could make best value of the day.",Disneyland_Paris
121591737,3,2011-12,United Kingdom,"Arrived at the resort on 5th December 2011 staying at Hotel Cheyenne. Checkin was swift and staff very polite, informed us of the block we were in and showed us on the map of hotel area.We were in block 12 Cochise. Found block easily and went inside top room which looked a bit tired and in need of refurb but only in there sleeping so was not particularly worried.Stayed half board (advisable or half board plus) as place has put up prices quite heftily.Chuckwagon cafe is where you eat your meals,and I would advise you to go prepared for a battle as it is like a war zone in there,leave your manners at home as nobody says excuse me thank you or please.I have spent many years going abroad but this is the first time I have noticed how rude and ignorant europeans are especially the Spaniards.We had one of our half board dinners in the chuckwagon cafe on the nighttime of our second day and aside from the free for all and the volume of noise it was a particularly nice all you can eat buffet, from starter thru to dessert it was very enjoyable.On our first night we ate at Annettes Diner and whilst it was good it was only burgers.The third night we ate at my daughters hotel the Santa Fe and the difference in attitudes and actions of the clientele was as wide as the atlantic.The meal was of similar standard and most enjoyable but the sense of calmness and the fact people were talking and not shouting and actually using manners was very welcome.Now on to the parks. The studio was quite quiet and was a pleasure to go around and we found that there was very little waiting time to get on the rides.My grandkids enjoyed themselves collecting autographs but I wish adults would realise this is for kids not themselves. Flying carpets attendant made the kids and adults laugh with his antics and funny voices whilst doing his job,it relaxed everyone and was nice to see someone enjoying doing their job.The main park was a disappointment ,as you walk in there is a christmas scene on Main Street but that was it apart from the visit Santa area and the chapparal theatre which was a christmas show but that is where it all stopped.The staff were all bored,sullen faced and just going through the motions.We took the grandkids to see Santa and had a thoroughly unhappy 2 hr wait to see him. The europeans even had 1 person queing up and as they got near the other 10 in the group appeared cimbed over the rope barrier and disappeared in to see Santa.The attendants did nothing to stop this routine and actually appeared to condone this.Another ruse that people used and that was not stopped was people getting in the disabled access area and being let in (some of these were relatives of staff members).After all this the park is looking tired and in need of a massive refurbishment but due to the fact it is open 365 days a year this is not possible and only bits at a time can be done and therefore a lot of rides that people really enjoy are closed for maintenance.Overall if they are advertising Christmas at Disney I expect more of an American style Christmas from an American company and a tawdry French Christmas",Disneyland_Paris

121549610,5,2011-10,United States,"It was my first time at Disneyland. I visited 2 parks: Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios. Both are great! I spent there 1 weekend, there are plenty of attractions in both parks, but Disneyland is bigger and I think you should start your visit there. If you plan to visit both parks then 2 days is absolutely minimum. There are long ques (even 1h) to many attractions, it's worth to use fast pass   then it takes usually not more than 20min. I've heard opinions that during summer is even worse. I was there in October and managed to try many attractions but still there are some left for the next time ;)",Disneyland_Paris

Whilst it was cold outside there are plenty of places to get warm between rides and shows, plus lots of restaurants to have a hot drink and a snack at.No new rides since our last visit two years ago, well maybe Captain EO in place of Honey I shrunk the Audience, but the parades have been updated, Plenty of rides to do, and minimal queues midweek, so did not have to wait longer than 10 minutes for anything during our visit.It still has the magic, and with the Chrismas decorations starting to go up and the  Main Street Snow  experience every 30 mins or so, it was great to be back.",Disneyland_Paris

Luckily there were fewer visitors this time than during summer, so we coul take several of the rides several times. And as before, we believe that they lack a few faster and more exciting rides.Ok for a day, but for pure adventure I believe Port Aventura outside of Barcelona is morefun, and deserves 2 days.",Disneyland_Paris
121355315,4,2011-12,United Kingdom,"Just returned from Disneyland Paris As a whole we have visited the Park many times before however it never seems to lose its appeal or its excitement when you first see the Disney castle. Traveling with our young daughter (1 and a half years old) we didn   t do much of the big stuff but made it more about her and did the kiddy stuff. We found the queues for Peter Pan   s flight, cups and saucers & Small land took around 10 15 minutes, which was very good. The only massive gripe we had was the queues for baby changing. Top tip for this was they have the same facilities in most gents    toilets, so nose plugs out for Dads! As for dining it   s expensive! We ate at Toad Hall where we had fish and chips the meal size was reasonable and with a drink cost 12.95 Euros each. We were shocked at how expensive other restaurants and trade stands were. Shops offer a great selection of Disney merchandise however again this is at a premium cost! The trick is as hard as it may seem is concentrated on the attractions and not the shops. Coming from a long standing Disney customer things which may not seem noticeable the first time you visit the park, are on return visits. We couldn   t help notice that details are being forgotten and things are starting to look a little worn. Saying that Disney Land is pure MAGIC for any child and given the opportunely you should go! Thanks for reading my review",Disneyland_Paris
121349156,4,2011-11,United Kingdom,"Good points: I went to Disneyland Paris at the end of November. It was a great place to be for christmas as they had all the decorations up, there were great parades, christmas shows, music and a christmas tree lighting ceremony. I went on a monday wednesday so it wasn't over crowded. Nearly all the attractions were open but it is best before visting to check their website for any closed attractions as I looked and saw one particular ride would be closed on tuesday and wednesday, so made sure I visited it on monday. Some of the rides are better than those in florida such as it's a small world, pirates of the caribbean, and the haunted mansion. I didn't try it but apparently big thunder rail is better too. The staff were very friendly too but I always asked first 'parlez vous anglais' first in politeness as I was in France, and they always reacted well as it would be rude to launch straight away into english. (Imagine showing up in England at a theme park speaking to staff in a foreign language without checking they speak it). The shows were multi lingual so that one character would speak in french, and another character would say exactly the same thing but in English. I didn't try any food as I had brought food in with me from my hotel, but compared to Florida there seemed to be a lot more all you can eat sit down buffet restaurants since french people don't seem to like walking around snacking and eating apparently. There were some snack bar type places which sold food at theme park prices. The park was very beautifully presented especially the garden areas and outdoor areas were constantly cleaned. Even if you've been to Florida, I still think the park is worth a visit.Bad points: I would have given 5 stars rather than 4 stars to the park but there were two noticeable problems. The first was the fact that the toilets were a disgrace which given the general cleaniness elsewhere was a surprise, and many drinking water fountains were not working.The second was the fact whilst no one smoked indoors, a small number of smokers (only a few people smoked) ignored the rules on smoking in queues or elsewhere. They could cure this problem by simply placing visible larger no smoking signs within the outdoor queue areas where people can see them. They could also place large visible signs stating where the smoking areas were in the park, rather than relying on people reading maps and guessing where they were located, since I doubt any smokers knew about the rules as they were not visible anywhere, or simply having a rule that people can only smoke next to outdoor entrances to toilets which is easy to remember. However the number of smokers overall was very low and not as bad as I thought it would be based on what I have previously read on tripadvisor comments for this park and they don't sell cigarettes in any of the parks.",Disneyland_Paris
121344843,5,2011-11,United Kingdom,"Well what can i say it lives up to every thing we expected and more, plane your day as the park is so big we thought we had seen it all but we kept finding placers we had not been. The parades are amazing but get your place at least 30 minutes before it begins or you will be stood at the back, the ques for rides can be quite big so use your card to fast track them. there were loads of characters to have your photo taken with but you will have to push your children to the front or people will just go in front of you.",Disneyland_Paris

121301799,2,2011-7,United States,"If you go and are expecting a Florida Disney World experience you will probably be disappointed. The lines were extremely long. People were smoking while standing in line and every time the line stopped moving it seemed like everyone jumped up on the railings which made the wait even longer as everyone climbed down to move forward. We waited in line for the Aerosmith Roller Coaster for over two hours. Apparently, just as we reached the inside of the non air conditioned building the ride broke down, we don't know what happened because no one made and announcement. After sitting on the floor for another 30 minutes without moving we just left. After nearly 8 hours we managed to only get on three rides. On a positive note, I will say that the two meals we ate in the park were reasonably priced and good.",Disneyland_Paris
121267692,3,2011-10,Australia,"This was my first trip to Disneyland with children and my first back to a Disney park since 1991. I don't think the French can pull off that happiest place on Earth vibe. It mystifies me how the staff in the LA park can do it   I recall that to a person every staff member in the park seemed happy. It is not like the staff in the Paris park are grumpy or rude and some of them are very very friendly and seem to be enjoying their jobs but most are just going through the motions. Don't get me wrong   Paris Disneyland is still fun, but it is not magic. The other thing that struck me is how little has changed since 1991 and I think DIsneyland has fallen behind in the rides department. All of the future world should be scrapped and re done. The only world that stands up to time is the fantasyland. Its a small world is still magical and the small rides are a delight for the kids. The merchandise was outrageously overpriced and the food was overpriced and bad   not that we tried to much of it quickly deciding to eat just outside of the park at the Earl of Sandwich where an excellent hot sandwich ran 5.50 and a 250m bottle of rose was 4.40   and I needed that after a day in Disneyland with a 2 and 4 year old.",Disneyland_Paris
121201777,4,2011-5,Brazil,"Disney Paris is located in Marne la Vallee, France. You can get there by RER, using the zone 5 ticket. It is about 1 hour from the Eiffel tour area, if you are staying close to it. You have to get to a station called Nation and from there you get a RER train that goes to Disney Parc. There are several sign, indicating where to go, so it is very easy and there is no need to ask anyone. Marne la Vallee is the last station and you have to leave the train once you get there, off course. When you leave the station you already see the 2 parks, so there is no way to get lost there. You can also see the Disney Village, which is a version of Disney downtown from Orlando. (smaller and no Cirque Du Soleil). Village is free of charge to get into and there is some restaurants like McDonalds, Planet Hollywood, RainForest Cafe and Disney Cafe. Around 8pm it gets crowded and it is really impossible to get anything to eat. There is also a big disney store there, divided into several store which is nice to check and has basically everything you find inside the park, but in a single place. The store is crowded at any time, but it has a good service with english spoken. I got a Mickey's straw for 3,5 euros, a mug for 10 euros and an ice tray for 11,80 euros. I reserved 1 day to go to each park, but if you don't have much time, you can visit both in the same day and save some money as there is a ticket that allow you to enter both parks at the same day for about 80 euros. I paied 57 euros for each park and visited in different days. Disnay Parc is the one with the castle and has much more attraction. Visit it first and then go to Disnay Studio on the same day, if you will. Disney park is big and there are several attractions and the parade. The first attraction that I visited was the hauting house and the line was huge. The ship that goes around a lake was closed for maintenance and Indiana Jones rollercoster close for maintenance, after I had waited 45 minutes on the queue. I this time I was disappointed. After that I had no other problem visiting other attraction, but 3 problems on the 3 first attraction sucked. After that I found 1 other attractions closed. The service isn't the same as you have in Orlando. The way employees talk to you in Orlando is far different. You have magic there, but in Paris, they don't care much. In addition, I thing it is not organized as Orlando is. Several people smoking everywhere.Disney Studio is smaller and you can visit it very quickly. The Terror Tower is crowded at everytime and 1:30 wait is the average. I just gave up! Disney is disney, so it is always wonderful and pleasant, but if you compare, the service, the attractions availability and size, Paris loses to Orlando in everyway.",Disneyland_Paris

The only thing that spoilt the trip was the attitude of the staff at the disney parks, they are miserable they couldn't care less if they serve you or not, they are very slow at everthing they do and the body lanuage shows that they are very un happy at what they are doing. In the Blockbuster cafe in the Disney studios one supervisor made the cashier cry as she was serving us. Although the staff done their best to try and spoil are beak we still had a great time.

The rides that broke down was Crushes Coaster after queuing in for about 40 minutes, 4 people from the front they switched all the lights on and emptied the ride. The other ride was Big Thunder mountain which again we got to the front of the queue and were next to get into the car when everyone was asked to leave. Thankfully for that one we got a fastpass to go back later in the day. It was cold and dark and personally for me i thought it made the event, i drank lots of coffee.

Everywhere here costs money even the little train or ferry from the hotel is    2 each !! All free in the US both the parks can be done in a couple of days this time of year.

120898324,1,2011-11,United Kingdom,I have just returned from Disneyland Paris and am hugely dissappointed. All of the staff are French and obviously means the service you recieve is poor. They come across rude and not bothered. Everyone smokes in the park so you leave smelling of smoke which cant be good for the children. They even light up in queues for rides so you cant even breath. Some of the rides are soo old and run down you can see the rust. Especially rides like Star Tours and Armaggedon should be closed down as they look like something out of the 90's. The Disney Village is just as bad Planet Hollywood is nothing compared to the London version. Rude waiters and old run down interior. Mcdonalds meals had more taste than Planet Hollywood. I was dissappointed at the overall experience. The queues were crazy and the security at the entrance was a joke. You could easily bypass the bag search by walking around the side and at some times they had no bag search at all. French people have no clue of how to queue and rather than stand in a line at rides and at the entrance they prefer to gather around and push through. The only positive was Val D'Europe the shopping centre near by. Had quite a few shops and resturants which we enjoyed. I would reccomend Disneyland Orlando if you want the real experience. The French have completley lost the idea of Disney.,Disneyland_Paris
120867575,2,2011-11,United Kingdom,"We have just come back from spending two days with our grandchildren, aged 4 and 6, at Disneyland Park. Although the children really enjoyed themselves we were exceedingly disappointed by the whole experience and how much it cost. The steam fair in the local park would have provided just as much fun for a tenth of the price. The whole place seems to be designed to pack in as many people as possible and treat them as badly as possible. The queues even for food are horrendous and when you get the food it is hardly worth eating. We couldn't find anywhere to sit inside so we were glad it wasn't raining. We tried a la carte in two different places as a result   what a disappointment too. I have just broken my leg so didn't plan to go on any rides. After the first day, when my husband and kids had only managed to get on three attractions, I decided I needed to go with them. People with disabilities go to the front of the queue   so with my magic pass we managed five attractions. But it took us two hours on the first day to obtain our pre booked park tickets, queue to get through security, queue for my wheelchair, queue to get in to the park and queue to get my disability pass. So some compensation. My advice to everyone is DON'T go   but obviously judging by the crowds many people do like it   and do back for me. Our grandchildren loved it and will tell their friends it is a fantastic place. I'm afraid, it confirmed all my worst prejudices.",Disneyland_Paris
120866814,2,2011-11,United States,"Pros: easy acess from Paris, a nice break for kids who are weary from Paris (museums, sigthseeing), familiar rides that my 8 year old son looked forward to, well organized and similar to both Disneyland and Magic Kingom   Orlando.Cons: smoking is allowed EVERYWHERE, and I mean EVERYWHERE even where you cannot escape it (eg people light up right next to you while you're stuck standing in line for Small World)...why they haven't banned it at Disneyland is amazing and a huge turnoff; I found the park on the rather unclean and worn side (worn pain, litter in places) that you just wouldn't see in other Disney locations; my son is tall enough to ride Indiana Jones and Space Mountain back in the US but was disappointed when turned away as not tall enough for the rides in Paris (parents...please check the minimum heights before you go to set expectations with kids because it's different here); I'm tolerant of different cultures yet found that the 'Disney brand of fun' with the staff didn't carry forward here...for example, many staff in the food areas seemed like they didn't like their jobs, were checking their watches, didn't smile much. Not a big deal unless you're a Disney fan and know that this isn't usually the case with staff in other parks. Lastly, while you could get this anywhere, I had a man directly in front of us take nearly 200 flash photos during It's a Small World...in the US, this would be discouraged but here it's tolerated. Kinda ruined the 45 minutes we waited for the ride. Oh...and FYI for first timers to Europe, Sunday is family day so you're likely to have extremely long waits if you visit Disneyland Paris on a Sunday. 60 95 minutes wait per ride was our experience. We are big Disney fans but this was a letdown and while we can say 'been there done that' we won't be back :(",Disneyland_Paris
120859999,4,2011-11,United Kingdom,"We visited the park November 2011. Weekdays were great as the queues weren't long but avoid weekends! It gets ever so busy!! Food drinks are very expensive. Buffalo bill dinner show was excellent except the food which weren't great at all. If you go on a weekday, you could possibly finish both parks in 2 days.",Disneyland_Paris
120856302,4,2011-2,United Kingdom,"Firstly, I'd like to praise Disney regarding their disabled access for rides. My son is autistic and without the priority shown to him with his disabled pass he should have had meltdowns in all the mad queues for rides. Unfortunately though, the Mad HattersTea Cups, Big Thunder Mountain, and Space Mountain were all being fixed when we tried to go them. They were out of action for most of the day. We were staying there for 3 days, but if you'd only had a one day pass this would have been much more annoying to find that the more popular rides weren't running at certain times. Maybe it's coincidental, but it made me wonder whether they close these rides routinely during off peak days in order to service them.",Disneyland_Paris
120831496,4,2011-5,United Kingdom,"This park is good, although not as good as the one in Florida.  For a weekend break its excellent.  Quite compact, has parades, but not fireworks.  Not many characters roaming around to have photos taken with",Disneyland_Paris
120813536,5,2011-11,United Kingdom,"Prices at the Park     I have read all the reports about eating in the Park being expensive and I agree it   s not cheap but it is still worth doing in places. The kids were tired after the 5pm parade but we wanted to see the 7pm one so we went to Plaza Gardens Restaurant and for 22 euros per adult and 12 per child there was an all you can eat buffet of good quality food. I could not fault it and as the price included soft drink, main, desert, cheese etc I think it was reasonable. It meant we only had a 20 metre walk from watching the parade at the Plaza, relaxed for a while the after our food, then had the 7pm parade right outside, so no walking. The Parks were great fun, the kids top 51.Parades     we saw 3, one at The studios and 2 at the main park, loved all 3.2.Finding Nemo ride     we enjoyed it as much as them, good ride3.Live Disney Playhouse on stage     show in the Studio Park     they loved it4.Buzz Lightyear ride     did it at least twice a day, everyday 5.Seeing Characters as you went aroundWe booked our own transfers and used Ezyshuttle (8 seater taxi   s) met us at the airport and collected us at the end of our stay     no issues, good friendly service. It was cheaper than the fast train from the airport for a group and saved taking the children down the maze of corridors in the train station.Repeats     These are all things I read before I went and agree with. Rainforest Caf  , Disney Village, great fun, good food. Fastpass     get the hang of it, saves you loads of time. Water     fill up your bottles at breakfast to avoid paying 3.50 euros in the park. Take snacks for the kids, it passes the time in the queues (couple of rolls from the breakfast buffet went down well).",Disneyland_Paris
120807999,4,2011-11,Australia,The park was very organised. When we visited it wasn't very busy but I can see how well organised it would be and is set up for large crowds. Staff were helpful and the park was clean and tidy. The rides were good and the characters were very user friendly for our 4 and 6 year old. The parade was good and the fake snow was a winner (although it was just about cold enough to snow for real). My only dissapointment would be the lack of observation of other patrons for designated smoking areas. Basically people smoke anywhere and everywhere which I found really annoying!,Disneyland_Paris
120796288,5,2011-11,United Kingdom,Having just coming back from my 6th trip I never tire of the place.  It still has the same magical appeal as the first time I went and we are already planning to go again.,Disneyland_Paris
120779110,2,2011-11,United States,"We have been to all the Disney World parks, California Disneyland and Adventureland, and Disneyland Hong Kong. All were great. So I was surprised to find how bad of an experience we had in Disneyland Park and Studios.I won't complain about the cost of food and drinks, and they are expensive in all amusement parks, and it's just expensive in Europe period.The parks and rides themselves are mostly the same, although I found the Peter Pan ride to be very dark in the beginning. You could hardly see anything. After the dusk, many areas of the park are poorly lit! It was scary and few to no staff around.We were surprised to find that there are no nightly fireworks. The fireworks were at Disney Village (like Disney Downtown) on certain nights and to me had no Disney feel about it. It was more of a laser light show with rock or pop music (nothing to do with Disney) finishing off with some fireworks. The show lasted like 30 minutes, way too long. We were very bored and towards the end just wanted it to end. Actually, we left before it finished because we had dinner reservations at Cafe Mickey. I could not tell what the theme of the show was. Pink Floyd played at one point. I love Pink Floyd, but have no idea what it has to do with Disney.The parks are not that old, but the bathrooms look old and stink!My biggest complaint is all the smoking. You cannot escape it. People even smoke in line! I didn't notice in Disneyland Park, but I remember seeing a small sign just at the beginning of the line entrances in Studio in French that indicates no smoking. No one is around to enforce it, and if there is a rule to only smoke in designated areas of the park, no one follows it. I was just in shock by the number of people smoking, especially with all the kids around. Most of these people are smoking with their kids next to them, so of course they could care less about other kids. This really ruined the experience for us as my son and I are very sensitive to smoke. By the 2nd day, I had a sore throat. My son was coughing.Being Disney lovers, we want to go to all the Disney parks. We glad we came because we can mark Paris off, but what a shame we have had a bad Disney experience.",Disneyland_Paris

There were many fun shows and rides for the youngster age 2 and 5. The shows were fun for them too.

120742130,4,2011-11,Portugal,"We did the 5 nights at the Disney New York Hotel bed breakfast & Parks admission package as the Hotel was a 5 minute stroll to Disney Village plus another 5 minutes to the Park entrances.This was an excellent location for a 70 year old, a 4 year old and 3 inbetweens especially on the return walk back after spending a full day in the parks.Good size comfortable rooms,very helpful staff especially at the concierge & Luggage Bellboy desks.Very good breakfast but a wee bit dissapointed at not being able to buy a quality burger or corned beef sandwich etc(It is The New York Hotel after all !) as it was all inclusive buffet prices which is expensive for not very hungry little people or adults with small appetites in the evenings.Meant having to go back out.This hotel is 100% family with sce rink.swimming pool and Roger Rabbit's corner which are all superb as extras away from the parks.A must is the Grand Parade to be transported into Disney's World..It is a must to book well in advance any Disney Village restaurants for dinner opr face long lines of people waiting in the cold for simply ages.

Some people think that Disney Parks are all the same, but they are not...Disney Paris is very charming and if you like amusement parks like us, you have to go! They have some different attractions there (Crush's Coaster at the Disney Studios is awesome!) and the   french touch all over the place  is  tr  s magnifique ! We were there on Christmas day...it is a great idea if you don't know people in Paris and want to have fun on Christmas day. If you are going to be there(Disneyland Paris) around December January be prepared... It was a beautiful day but very, very cold.... snow covered ground!!! The lines were not long, but both parks(Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park) were busy. We left Paris at 8am(by tour bus with Cityrama) and returned around 6pm. We are able to do both parks in one day but, we have been to Disney California and Disney World many times, so we didn't have to go again to all the attractions at Disneyland Paris an Walt Disney Studios Park. If it is your first time at Disney, maybe you should buy the two days tickets and split the parks.I heard you can take the train from central Paris and it is very easy to get to Marne la Vall  e where the parks are....we will try it next time.",Disneyland_Paris

120694593,5,2011-11,United Kingdom,"Visited here 10th   13th Nov as the Christmas theme had started a few days before. Place was beautiful, fake snow, wonderful decorations and Christmas tree and of course all the fantastic parades and shows.Don't come here if you dislike nostalgia and Xmas music   the place is a fantasy land and you have to get into the Xmas schmaltz. The music sound system is superb. Place was very clean, staff seemed to jump out from nowhere and sweep up anything as soon as it was dropped   lots of staff, all dressed in appropriate costumes to fit their location in the park. We thought we'd come off peak but didn't realise Armistice Day here is a public holiday so it seemed that the whole of France arrived for the Fri and Saturday   hence the queues for rides were immense. We managed a few of the shorter queues and opted to use our hotel  early bird  passes the next day at 8am where we got 2 hrs on specified rides before the crowds arrived. Met Santa and Disney characters and so our 6yr old daughter was very happy. Saw ice show which was very good too and took a ride on the train that circles the whole park. Weather was very nice for Sat and Sun and we enjoyed sitting in the sun enjoying a coffee and taking a trip on the Mississippi Steamboat. Lots to do there  most things covered by your park ticket. Meals and snacks very expensive compared to home but it didn't seem to be stopping anyone enjoying them. Disney merchandise everywhere. Get a programme at the park entrance and work out what's on when and where, so you can get to the area in time .Parades and shows are great but cause big crowds of people at places or at pavement edges along the route   so set off in god time to get through them and to get a place at the front if you're going to watch the parades.",Disneyland_Paris
120671261,5,2011-7,Canada,"I am a fan of all things Disney, so when myself and my son went to Disneyland Paris for the first time we were both entranced. Everything is clean, neat, nearly perfect! The parades were great as was our chance meeting with Mickey and Minnie together! I have been to Disney World quite a bit and Disney Paris is smaller but it has all of the main rides and the lines were all shorter. Disney can get to be quite expensive so setting rules with children before leaving may be helpful. We also bought the half board plan since we were staying at a Disney hotel and then the cost of our suppers were already paid for before we left   it helps with budgeting. We were at this park for two days, another day would have made it more relaxed but two days was sufficient. A truly magnificent experience!",Disneyland_Paris
120627980,4,2011-11,United Kingdom,"It definiteky does what you expect from disney but her are some tips;just been with the christmas magic and believe me it was, dont miss santa and his elves they were fantastic.Use your fastpasses wisely some rides were over an hour wait.Dont miss the christmas tree illumination at 6.00 or the illumination parade at 8.00 they are worth the wait as is the lighting up of the castle at 6.30 ish. the fake snow and twinkly magic made it a christmas not too forget, and stay as late as you can, between 8 10 at night the rides are empty except weekends.have fun !!",Disneyland_Paris
120612735,5,2011-11,United Kingdom,"We have visited Disneyland Paris several times before but this is my first review. I have to say that it has developed into a really magical experience for young and old alike. The Christmas lights and parade were top notch as we have all come to expect from Disney, there are also a few new rides since we were last there, crush's coaster, slinky dog and all the rides in the new Toy Story playground are excellent and we can't wait to take the granddaughters when they are old enough. Some of the rides are'nt available in Florida or California (we have visited both many times) and some are better because they are newer, for example  it's a small world . It's just a wonderful place to be and as always manages to make all your troubles disappear. It's also worth mentioning that when wwe were there the weather was dry and sunny and around 15 degrees C and it just seemed much easier to keep going all day, without what can sometimes be oppressive heat.",Disneyland_Paris
120611382,4,2011-11,United Kingdom,"Our second trip to Eurodisney this time with two kids in tow aged 8 and 4. We booked it as part of a pack having travelled there by coach with Ledger holidays (won't do that big again!) Used the shuttle buses to get to the park   these run regularly about every 10 mins HOWEVER be careful when you get on with the small child   people will push and shove you and stick their backside in the kids face if they are in a buggy. I have never seen such a pack of animals try to board a bus   so rude and that's just the british. You soon learn that by being polite and queueing you won't get anywhere   so dump your manners and join in! The park was not too busy   remember to take your Easypass if you stay in a disney hotel as that's the golden ticket to get onto certain rides in the park before everyone else. Most of the queues were about 5 20 mins. Warning   Princess Pavillion very often has a massive queue but don't be fooled you only get to see one Princess and it can be anyone of them   usually Mulan who admittedly isn't a favourite in our house!! It seems as if the staff favour the french (sorry but its a fact) Wouldn't bother doing it next time. Most the rides were brilliant   the kids loved them. Pirates, Small World, Thunder Mountain, Phantom Manor, Peter Pan, Buzz (a huge favourite with the grown ups as well) Star Wars, Casey Jnr (you'll have to hunt for this).Lots of characters around the park   better to queue when they rope off a section as otherwise it's a bit of a scrum and unless you're pushy, perhaps your kids won't get a look in. Don't bother with the autograph books   you'll just end up queueing all the time. The parade was Once Upon a Dream and as usual was magical   what Disney is all about. We all loved it and timed our visit well so that on the last day the Christmas tree was up and lit :) We went specifically for the fireworks which admittedly were absolutely rubbish   if you can do Legoland in Windsor their fireworks are amazing by comparison. The girls thoroughly enjoyed and our hopper ticket allowed us to switch between parks. A great day out :) Negatives. People pushing shoving without a minute to live and no manners. Food is very expensive in the park for what it is ie.   2.55 for a little tub of chips!! Toilets are not attractive and tend to be a bit wiffy   warn the kids!",Disneyland_Paris
120585222,4,2011-10,United Kingdom,our 8th visit to disneyland paris still good but the busiest i've ever seen it but it was half term still with the extra magic hours and park being open until 9 we did a split shift as it were and got on plenty of rides and had a good timesome critisms though disappointed that big thunder seemed to break down every daytoilets all seemed to be smell of urine this never used to be the caserats! yes i know they say you're never far away from them but saw 3 in different places i appreciate it must be hard to keep on top of (and Disneyland are obsessive about litter clearing) but yuk!,Disneyland_Paris

120471059,3,2011-10,United States,"I'm really glad we saw Disneyland Paris. I live in California and visit Disneyland California Adventure annually. So, when we decided to go to Paris, of course we had to check out Disney Paris.First of all, Downtown Disney is very small. They you can find currency exchange, Planet Hollywood, Starbucks (yeah), McDonald's with free wifi, Rainforest Cafe, a number of Disney stores, a few restaurants, and that's about it. Disney Studio is wonderful. I think we really enjoyed it because we have nothing to compare it to in California. I enjoyed the tour tram, the Toy Story section was awesome. Disneyland Paris had some unique items, but not many. I think there should be way more Disney Paris items than there were. I don't want to buy something I can buy at home. Very limited in merchandise of characters other than Mickey and Minnie. Thunder Mountain Railroad (our favorite at home) was closed in Paris yet again for a 2nd derailment in 6 months. It's a small park. Very few cast members, almost none. Very dark in some of the lands to the point of being a bit scary. Very few food offerings and extremely expensive at that. The biggest turn off were the restrooms. They were filthy and smelled of urine. Not at all to our Disney standard. The Disney hotels were beautiful.",Disneyland_Paris
120464081,5,2011-11,United Kingdom,"My partner and I were on holiday in central Paris and decided to have a day trip to Disneyland Paris. I am 23 and I honestly had a great day out, was fantastic. The park was very, very, very quiet.Tickets cost us 47Euro each, as we are both students in the UK. So if you are a student, it is worth taking your student University card with you to get the discount they offer.The day we went, the weather was a bit damp and a bit dark, but that honestly did not take away from the fun. I can say that going to Disneyland is an all weather trip out. Although if it is raining, do take a umbrella (or buy a Minnie ears hat, like I did), as it is outdoors.From some of the more negative reviews I have read on TripAdvisor, I would just like to add my opinion to a few things, from what I experianced on the day I went.* On the day that we went, only about 2 3 rides were closed, but these were clearly advirtised on the website, so had no negative effect on us at all.* Obviously, being a slightly damp day, we literally had no queue time at all for rides. But even if there were, honestly what do people expect at a busy theme park? Queues should be expected.* The food is expensive, however, they seemed to not have a problem at all with taking food into the park. We took in two packed lunches and even after going through security, no one said that we were not allowed to take food in, so my advice to save money is to take your own food.* The merchandise is expensive too. I paid 18Euro for a Disney hat, and it is very expensive, but I expected that, as I think everyone does. On the flipside, you can pick up little souvenirs very cheaply, I got a postcard for 1Euro.* I saw many Disney characters walking around the park and was able to have pictures with them all. Yes, you have to wait a bit, but for me, it was totally worth the few minutes wait. The characters are walking around and also have designated spots of where they stand and take pictures with you. Tip   to meet the princesses, try going to the Princess Pavillion.Overall, I had a brilliant day. It honestly was a dream come true, even for a 23 year old :) The park was clean, the workers are helpful, the rides are great fun and do not miss out on the parades. They are fantastic. Cannot rate this activity high enough. Do not hesitate to go!",Disneyland_Paris
120392080,1,2011-11,United Kingdom,Just back from euro disney and was warned by friends and family of what a complete rip off this place is! Have been to florida some years back and it is a different class to this dump. I will not go on about the price and quality of the food but the prices are just utterly ridiculous. The hotel (explorers) had the smallest room myself and family have ever stayed in!! The best tip I can give is to save your money and go to florida or get yourself a merlin annual pass for the uk parks which I have and works out very good value.,Disneyland_Paris
120370823,5,2011-11,United Kingdom,I love this place this time of the year as they have all the christmas trees up with artifical snow coming down through the main street and carols playing in the background it truely is magical and with the nights drawing in its getting dark about 5pm so all the lights are on making it look even more magical.A huge range of shops with everything disney you could imagine.Again i felt there was a lack of babycare facilities having to walk a great distance to find one at one stage in fantasyland i had to change my daughters nappy in her pushchair because there wasnt any facilities around which was very poor considerind fantasyland is more child orienatated. but this truely is a fabulous place a lot of walking so wear sensible shoes as its a long day.the queues where good most was 30mins but you can fasttrack most ridesfor free and your pretty much straight on.the food is very over priced and not that great a burger & chips (mcdonalds style ) will cost you 12euros and its pretty lame. Take sandwiches if possible.The final parade at 5pm is magical all the characters on different floats but arrive on the main street early otherwise you wont see much.There are plenty of characters around the park throughout the day but the queues can be lengthy for autographs and people do tend to just push you out the way there very rude.so patience is required lol.Overall a great place to be what ever time of the year !!!,Disneyland_Paris
120370203,5,2011-9,Australia,"We spent nearly 2 days in the park and found lots to do. Avoid space mountain if you are prone to travel sickness. The Orbitron was fantastic at night, viewing the lights of the park. Do use the fast pass tickets if the wait on a ride is over 30 minutes or so as this is a good way to save time in the lines. Frontier railway and Pirates of the caribbean were favourite rides.",Disneyland_Paris
120325267,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Having been to Disneyland Florida, I had high expectations for DLP.I was not disappointed. The Disney magic is still there, even though on a smaller scale than its sister park in Florida. Some of the French are difficult to deal with in regard to their manners, but if you have traveled to France, you will already know this.Trying to get near to any of the Disney characters with your children for an autograph and photo is near on impossible. No crowd control what so ever !!! My 2 year old was actually pushed away by an adult man, several times.The weather during a stay was kind, which always makes it more enjoyable.Make sure you stay for the evening fireworks over the castle, they will put a shiver up and down your spine, no matter what your age : ).Of course you should expect to Que. for any thing up to 2 hours for the bigger rides, but it is a theme park and it is Disney.A great stay and will defo be back (for the kids, not the adults of course). : )",Disneyland_Paris

120298066,2,2011-7,United States,"Children really enjoyed it (boys age 6 & 7) thank goodness.CrowdsRight form the start we were stood in a large mob of people which can be scary for young children totally surrounded. I was quite terrified of losing the children and them getting injuredSmokingAlso people were walking around smoking which was scary in such a crowded environment with cigarettes at children's head height, totally oblivious to the possible injury they may cause. QueuesDon't think we queued for less than 90 minutes for any ride. Arrived 9.30am & left 11.30pm and we managed to go on 7 rides shows in 12 hours. Very difficult with children aged 6 & 7. It was painful.ShadeSome of the queues for the rides had no shade at all. We had to disappoint our child who was desperate to go on the new turtle  Crusher  ride. There is no way we could wait in boiling midday sun for that long. CharactersThere were few and far between. When they did appear they were completely mobbed by everyone and kept moving walking on swiftly. This was dangerous as my yound child was grabbing on to them trying to hug them at the time as children will do! The characters paid more attention to unsuspecting adults 'patting' them on the head than to the children who were so desperately trying to get their attention. The train that they were on nearly ran someone over (they were being a bit daft). FoodWe managed to get in with the children carrying two tiny backpacks, I had a rucksack and my husband had a rucksack. We were never searched   maybe too manic and busy and they couldnt' be bothered. Food was extortionate even more expensive than Legoland. UpkeepWent ten years ago and they were really strict about not sitting on the grass. When we watched the fireworks at the end I noticed that the grass was completely trashed and bare in places and the flowers were trampled.

Altho the kids enjoyed themselves while in the park on the rides, even going in October it was still busy (some rides over an hour and a half wait)The euro is pretty much the same as the pound at the moment so everything to me was well overpriced. My daughter got the tangled dress from the disney store in the uk and it was   30, in paris it was   60. The food was proberly the worst thing for me and again overpriced. Most places to eat were like 'fast food' places and very expensive. We went to a buffet place one night and for 3 adults and 2 children (including 1 soft drink each) it came to just under   100. And lastly....the studio park closes at 6pm and the main park at 7pm after this there is nothing to do except eat and shop with the exception of the show or cinema.I wont be going back.....",Disneyland_Paris
120267056,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,My boyfriend took me to Paris for my birthday and we went spent 2 days at Disneyland. The place was magical apart from rides breaking down A LOT. We queued for over an hour for Rocky Mountain and then we were about to get into the cart and it shut down and their were people having to get out and walk along the tracks. When we were about to get on the Indiana Jones ride one of the handles just fell off. Apart from that it's a great place. I would've been more annoyed if we'd paid full price for it but we had promo vouchers for    20 a day.,Disneyland_Paris
120266902,5,2011-10,United Kingdom,"I went with my husband and two children aged 5 and 10. We all had the best time ever and would definately go again. I would recommend you plan your visit of which rides you particularly fancy going on and get a fastpass (only one per person until the time expires then you can go and get another one for a different ride)   this enables you to basically go to the front of the queue. My 5 year old could go on a great deal of rides so little ones don't get bored whilst waiting for their siblings on bigger rides. Her favourites were the Buzz Lightyear ride, Pirates of the Carribean and Peter Pan. It is well worth getting a good spot for the parade   it started at 5pm so be prepared for a half an hour wait once you've secured your spot. My children loved seeing the characters and managed to get plenty of their autographs, but my advice is book a table in the Cowboy Cookout and you can dine with the characters and obtain their autographs which is better than queuing for hours each day in the park and the food was good to!!",Disneyland_Paris
120226824,5,2011-10,United Kingdom,"We liked star wars, buzz lighyear, make sure u get fastpass for that, we was in the park anyway for the day, we had to wait 5hours for it, we do like it, to much waiting, and the fastpass line wasnt good, we should near the front. We like all of it, just go and enjoy yourself, and experience it, its lovely. enjoy",Disneyland_Paris

120186164,5,2011-5,Ireland,"Spent a week at disney this year with my family, and have to say it was mind blowing not just for the kids but for us the adults as well.the queues were a bit long bit time just flew by.Staff were really friendly and helpful..As a parent of a small child with special needs the whole experience was magical. We were given a special pass for our little boy and he was really looked after.I would highly recommend disneyland paris for any age..Great Holiday cant wait to go back....",Disneyland_Paris
120184215,3,2011-8,United States,"I have been back and forth to Eurodisney many times with my children and they love it although my eldest now 15 finds it boring. The full price entrance to the park is horrendous but use Tesco Clubcard points and they become sensibly priced. Food can be expensive but if you avoid the main restautrants and keep to the fast food outlets although the prices are still not cheap they are just about bearable.If you know what ride you want to do, head there first and queue but before you join the queue get a fastpass ticket (if available) and then if you are lucky by the time you have queued for the first ride your fastpass slot will have arrived. This only works first thing in the morning.My youngest 6 absolutely loves this place so I'm sure that I will be back again although I have to say that I am finding it a bit tedious after 8 trips!",Disneyland_Paris

120172878,4,2011-11,United States,"I seem to have gotten lucky and picked the right day    Wednesday 2 November 2011    when crowds weren't too big and the weather was pleasant. We found waits varied tremendously; in a time period between noon and 4pm they were: Indiana Jones  10 mins; Space Mountain 20 mins; Haunted Mansion 25 mins; Thunder Mountain Railroad 45 mins; Pirates of the Caribbean 50 mins.Having visited the Walt Disney parks in Orlando each year from 2002 04, I had to compare the Paris location with Orlando. We lucked out and had a pleasant weather day in Paris, comfortable in light jackets. And, thankfully, even though schools were out for All Saints break, this Wednesday was not overcrowded.Biggest negative in the park were the number of smokers among the guests. As an American, I just couldn't get over the number of guests letting that cigarette burn dangling from your hand in front of the baby carriage. My daughter and I both felt headaches coming on from the amount of cigarette smoke. The other thing that was striking was the European tendency to wear dark clothing, to me, tended to drag down the mood. I can just imagine being a staff member trying to cheer a crowd that is a sea of black, gray and brown bundled up blobs. I've never been in any amusement park with so many slack jawed and frowning faces.Unlike several commenters who say the staff is not as ebullient as staff in the American parks, I thought the staff were consistently good and upbeat. Plus, multilingual. Also, many commenters say the food is outrageously expensive. We got a chicken burger meal (fries plus large drink) for    9.99, which I figured was reasonable enough for a captive audience. And, I saw the park allowing people in with fairly extensive amounts of food and drink in their backpacks    which was very much frowned upon at the Florida parks. The rides seemed well maintained. When service was disrupted on Space Mountain, everybody got a FastPass good anytime for the rest of the day, which was great. Plus, transport to the park via RER was a real bonus. I love that the Disney Park, Disney Studio, and Disney Village are all together with the transportation bringing you to the park.Finally, price. I found the $72 per ticket for a one day park hopper (we started the morning at Disney Studios) reasonable. Ticket was purchased on line at Disney site in US dollars and was good for any day within six months of purchase.",Disneyland_Paris
120156924,5,2011-9,United Kingdom,Having read the report re that they dont give good help for people with disabilites I had to comment. I have been 3 times with people with learning difficulties and walking problems. We have always been given a pass to use disabled acess etc without having to show any kind of proof or give any personal details and have always been treated very well by all the staff who have gone out of their way to help us. I work for a very big organisation for people with learning difficulties and I know this has been the general experience of other people that have gone. This is why we keep going back.,Disneyland_Paris
120150447,2,2010-12,United Kingdom,Resort OK'ish' but staff rude and indifferent. Some even pretended not to understand English! ..I'm afraid the French to not know anything about Customer Service and are reluctant to communicate with visitors from the UK. French visitors pushed us aside as if the resort belonged to them and they should have priority. At an ice cream stall it took 5 people to serve 2 tubs of ice cream after a 10 minute wait! Everything was just the poor mans version of Disneyland USA with none of the 'Have a nice Day!' Never again!,Disneyland_Paris
120133389,3,2010-12,United Kingdom,"Disney land park was very crowded, but as we were expecting this it wasnt much of a problem. The parade was wicked and definately worth watching. I wouldn't say it was the best place to take young 'uns as there is a lot of walking involved. We saw people leaving prams with bags and things at the side of ride where there was no security and I must say we thought they were mental. The food was expensive, and I suggest you take a packed lunch. The character greetings were very crowded and you were lucky if you got near. Not the place for children what with people elbowing and shoving to get to the front. A small child got knocked over by a huge giant of a man and he didnt even stop to say sorry. All together worth a visit if only for the parade, but somehow I find it slightly overpriced.",Disneyland_Paris
120115519,5,2011-7,Germany,I was 24 when I visited this place. I was not quite sure if I want to go there. I though the place is more for kids. I had a lot of fun... It was beyond my expectations. It is very lovely place... And it was not so expensive   I paid 40 euros for one day   since I was student in France   i had discount of 25 euros. My sister also got discount wiht Euro26 card. Very lovely   I was recently in Praternstern in Vienna and it is funny & very expensive in comparison with Disneyland. Also you can use bathroom for free,Disneyland_Paris
120110698,5,2011-10,United Kingdom,"This was my first time to a Disneyland of any type. I am from Australia, so the best thing we have is Dreamworld or Seaworld. Disneyland was so much better than I had expected. To be honest, I cannot comment on the price of entry, as my trip was paid for by someone else. I was also provided with a fast pass ticket, which again, I did not pay for, but would highly recommend people to get one. It lasts for one day only, so I used it to go on all of the fast pass rides in one day, and then used the next 3 days to visit all of the other rides. Tip  If you stay at one of the Disney hotels, you can enter the park at 8am, and the lines aren't any where near as big. But otherwise, the lines were pretty long and tedious...there were sometimes lines for up to 90 minutes...which is a bit ridiculous I think.I really enjoyed my experience here...I purchased souveniers for my family back in Australia, and spent over 200 Euro's which was pretty costly, considering I really didn't buy alot...but I didn't mind as I had not paid for anything else for the 4 days I was here... including food, which I did notice at some places was very expensive, and to be honest the quality was not the best. I suggest to pack a home made lunch, you will be thankful you did. At 29 years old, I felt like a kid again....The lights, characters, shows and rides were suitable for children and adults alike. Even I was excited to get my photo with some of the Disney Characters. The rides were also good, enjoyable and suitable for most ages. I only came across 2 rides with height restrictions... but most were suitable for families. I am a larger woman, so was a bit worried about fitting into the rides, as I had problems a few years ago in a theme park in Australia, but was so happy that I had not one problem on the rides here. As the rides were suitable for most, the harness seatbelt lap bar, were all pretty loose anyway. I saw people bigger than me going on rides as well, and no one seemed to have any problems. My visit to the park was at halloween, so we entered the park that evening for the halloween night. It cost extra...i think, and was great to see other tourists and staff all dressed up in halloween costumes. The staff were really good, and this would be suitable again for children and adults, provided the children are ok seeing other tourists dressed up as vampires and cannibals. :DI should also add that the toilets were clean at all times, at each different location I entered. There is also  stroller  rental, which are big enough for the whole family to use...I did see a grown man being pushed in one. lol. I don't know how much they cost...but it was a good idea. Both parks were lots of fun...and I can't wait to go back again next year!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
120086666,4,2011-7,Switzerland,"We spent four wonderful days there. Went on all the rides. It was like a trip back in time, no matter what age, one feels like a kid again.   Unfortunately my husband had his wallet stolen. The food is absolutely horrible.",Disneyland_Paris
120022009,5,2011-9,Hungary,We live 33 miles away from Disneyland Park. My kids have so much fun every time that we go to the park. Around 1 hour away by car we get free parking because we have the yearly pass. My kids love all the show and the ride they enjoy the most is the slinky dog ride. We usually stay for 4 to 5 hours every time we visit. The yearly pass allows us to enjoy the park and not push every single activity into 1 or 2 days.,Disneyland_Paris
120009253,5,2011-10,South Africa,"Excellent place for kids and grownups alike. Only a few rides have height restrictions so even the little ones can keep busy. Opens at 10am and closes at 6pm, so spend as little time as possible in the restaurants as there is just too much to see and do. I would suggest a three day visit to ensure you get to everything in both parks.",Disneyland_Paris
120007032,3,2011-5,Cyprus,"I expected more... my idea was kind of Florida's Disneyland.. it is still good   nice crowdy atmosphere... but... very much for kids, probably best for families that really want to impress their 4 to 8 years old kids... most attractions are mainly for young kids...

119954555,4,2011-9,United States,"On September 16, 2011 my wife, sister in law, step daughter and grandson traveled the Metro and RER to Disneyland Paris. The entrance is a beautiful sight completely different than all the other parks. Main street is made of bricks and the sidewalks are much wider. Smoking is allowed everywhere. The most interesting sight was no Mickey Mouse ears. Only Minnie Mouse ears being worn by men, women and children. Strange. There are about half the rides of Disneyland but two days would have been better to truly enjoy Disneyland Paris & Walt Disney Studios. They are as up on gluten free eating like they are in the states which was surprising. Space Mountain was the most violent roller coaster I've ever been on so be careful. They must not have the same restristions for safety as in the states. Indiana Jones was a big flop. Just an outdoor roller coaster and not nearly the fun as the original. The castle is AMAZING! Most everything is in English.To see the Walt & Mickey statue that is at Walt Disney studios. The stunt show is good and Rock & Roller Coaster is a blast. Having a 10 to 7 day is just not enough time.If you have a Paris Metro Pass (not just a ticket) show it at the ticket window for 20% off. : )",Disneyland_Paris
119948776,3,2011-10,Canada,"I visited the park with my 3 children under 5. I have been to Disneyland Orlando and Annaheim myself as a child. Although the park is as you would expect, and the grounds perfectly manicured and kept very clean, I had 2 major complaints. The toilets were disgusting. The floors were uniformly covered with urine. Second the food was abysmal   all expensive junk food, with the exception of Auberge de Cendrillon, where the food was very nice, but very expensive (booking essential). Lastly I would strongly recommend getting a VIP fast pass to skip queues.",Disneyland_Paris
119942981,3,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Just come back from  Euro disney  with a mixture of emotions, the park itself is fantastic, however the queues and prices put a dampener on the visit. I went expecting the park to be busy as it was half term, but queues up to 90 minutes for a 1 minute ride were excessive, it appeared to me that they admitted far too many people into the park, which resulted in the large queues.Additionally due to the number of people using the  fast pass tickets  you were only physically able to use one per day, and some days we had to wait 5 hours to use this ticket.Food and drink prices were also excessive, 19 Euros for a basic burger and chips, 5 Euros for a very small carton of pop corn.To summarise my children loved the park itself and the shows, however queueing was an issue.",Disneyland_Paris
119924714,3,2011-10,United Kingdom,"I have been to DLP numerous times and for me, it's always been a favourite, much desired location. I think now though I'm finally growing up and seeing it for what it is, imo, just a moneymaking machine.We stayed in the Disneyland hotel   it was ok, certainly not as bad as some of the other reviews would have you believe, but not really luxurious as it's touted. No coffee facilities in the rooms, slightly poor houskeeping   which wasn't addressed   EXTREMELY poor lighting in the room and for me, the ultimate negative, no wireless. In this day and age! And also, due to the warm weather in October, the vermin population was booming   we saw rats in broad daylight scampering literally about 30   40m from our ground floor, french windowed room. There was no leaving those doors open to enjoy the balmy weather, I can tell you! Disney are aware of the problem but obviously there is only so much they can do, so hey ho. My biggest criticism is of the park itself. You do expect some of the attractions to be closed, for whatever reason, but at the last count, over the period of our stay, it was about seven   the pirate ship, Storybook land, the Dragon's lair, I could go on. It was pathetic and considering the holiday was so expensive it really annoyed me. Attractions that made money were open however!The cast members   either couldn't do enough for you or basically couldn't be a****. Again, ridiculous.And it was eyewateringly expensive!Overall, we did have a good time, but what between the staff and the closed attractions I did come away slightly disillusioned with the whole thing. Next thing you'll tell me, Santa doesn't exist....",Disneyland_Paris

119908881,5,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Fantastic, wonderful parades, beautiful princesses, everything was set out really nice, the queues for the characters to sign autographs and have photos was not managed as good as in America, this could be done better.",Disneyland_Paris
119874151,4,2011-10,United Kingdom,"There is plenty to do in this park. Large parts of it are more geared to young kids than adults but with rides like Space Mountain 2 and Indiana Jones it caters for all tastes and ages. It can feel large to walk around if you meander but it is nowhere near as big as Magic Kingdom in Florida. There are plenty of characters out and about a a few shows too. I only have two things negative to say. 1) It would be really nice if they did fireworks at the end of the day but they don't seem to, even on special occasions and 2) too many of the rides were breaking down when we were there this week. Big thunder railroad was shut for at least a whle day, stuck on the tracks and a number of the other rides broke for 20 30 minutes at times. As with anything Disney though the place is brilliant for kids and they love it.",Disneyland_Paris

119853025,1,2011-10,United Kingdom,This was my fourth visit to this theme park and the worst!!The place has stood still in the main with mostly the same outdated and tired attractions its overpriced overated and overcrowded!!Having paid   150.00 per day for 3 of us i expected a first class park and on going improvements after my last vist 6 years ago!! Wrong!! Same park same attarctions!! Same queues!!Queues even for the most benign rides over 80 minutes!!Food and drink so overpriced and poor standard!!Organisation no existant they just want your money and are not prepared to give value!!Maps useless!!After adding flights and hotels this is poor value for money go to Alton Towers half the price twice the experience!!At least they do give a bit of customer service!!,Disneyland_Paris
119851149,2,2011-10,United Kingdom,"We went for the first time to Disneyland Paris Sunday 16th October for 5 days. We stayed in a disney hotel which was ok although no tea or coffee facilities. The reason for this choice was that we could have the extra magic hours. What a waste of time. Disney only opens one park and then only certain rides so all that happened is that everyone from the Disney hotels turned up and we all waited in endless Q's. The cast members were in the main unable to keep the Q's moving quickly and it is not unusual to be standing in endless lines while the 'car' in half empty! I would say there is no magic about the place. It is a licence to print money. The food in the park is very expensive and horrible. Cold burgers, cold chips poor, poor quality. But the biggest rip off is the Disney Village where we went to eat. Basically for 2 adults and a 6 year old. The cheapest meal we had was 69 euros. And for comparison we would have expected to pay in Scotland around   20 for what we bought. Q's everywhere at night for the resturants. At best you could say it was a poor experience. In Mickeys cafe our bill came to about 90    . For that we got childrens meal 18    2 starters and 2 main meals with soft drinks. Planet Hollywood was expensive and although the waiter was nice to us during our meal as soon as we paid and left the tip he then just turned away without another word and was just plain rude. Cold coffee, milk shakes 8   , We as a family were so disappointed by the experience. As I have said without exception the food was just such poor quality and the service was not much better in all the places we went to eat in the village. Take plenty of money with you as you are going to need it. To compare we could have gone to an all inclusive 4 5* hotel for 7 days somewhere else in Europe and we would have still paid less that it cost to experience the  Disney Magic . So we wont ever go back. Although the child enjoyed Disney, I would say that the theme parks around the uk are much better when you take into account the overall cost of the whole trip. Having been to Florida, most of the 'cast' at Paris do not embrace or even attempt to add anything of the Disney magic. They really need to get additional training or even some motivation but if that is too difficult they could always try smiling!!!",Disneyland_Paris

119831698,4,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Disneyland is a 'bubble'   the rest of the world doesn't exist. We found the map a bit useless, and couldn't find the rides to start with, but in some areas, there aren't actually that many. Disney is about the whole experience, not just thrills, and once we got this, we really enjoyed it. We saw the Disney Villains show and the Parade, which was a great way to end our visit.Queue times were long (half term) and it worth fast passing the rides that you can, or you will spend a lot of time waiting around. Nothing is cheap, and nothing is healthy, but it really is a magical place. The staff were excellent and the attention to detail is incredible. I think we enjoyed it more than the kids!",Disneyland_Paris
119792735,3,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Quite compact and can easily be done in one day. When it is crowded the queues can be extremely long, use fast pass where possible. Lacks the sparkle of the Disney parks in the USA",Disneyland_Paris
119786356,2,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Overall, this is not a true representation of a Disney theme park. It is a poor relation, they sell way too many tickets, so the parks are overcrowded, and there are not enough rides for people to go on, leaving huge queues. One morning as we entered there was a wait time of 95 minutes   first thing as the doors opened. This you don't see in Florida until well into the day and even then, there are far more rides and fast pass rides. Disneyland Paris has limited fast passes, half the rides break down on a daily basis, it is a total rip off for food, and what's more, the toilets stink and the characters giving autographs favour French speakers !Our main concern however, is that there is absolutely NO organisation of the characters giving autographs. Why can't there be an organised and civil line with people taking turns in an orderly manner ? The lack of organisation could be a joke except that our daughter's safety is no laughing matter. The characters are mobbed, our daughter was pushed and shoved by adults and we were alarmed that this happened time and time again. Furthermore, following a show on the stage, the characters came off the front of the stage, making the whole crowd surge forward. Our daughter was crushed between three adults who were more bothered about shoving their child on a photo, or to get to the packets of sweets the characters were handing out. It was totally unsafe, there was no barrier to stop the crowd crushing young children and this sort of action could cause an accident where a child could be injured. We have never been so anxious in a Disney park, and it spoilt our visit. Characters should not wander around allowing them to be swamped and encourage certain adults behaviour to become desperate and competitive to get to the characters. It is not acceptable health and safety in this day and age. The characters also wander from their initial spot   they are surrounded by a huge crowd of people with young children being pushed and shoved, then they make it worse by moving, always with the great mob following them   we lost our daughter on two occasions because the character moved. Again, this is not safe to do. No other Disney park has this irresponsible and disorganised way of access to characters. Every other Disney park has orderly managed lines with people taking turns. We would also like to point out that despite the rest of Europe banning cigarette smoking, the French still allow smoking outdoors, but what is not acceptable is that they allow adults within a Disney park to walk around, cigarette held at child height   ready for a child to be burnt by one. It is not acceptable.It is suffice to say that we would never return to Paris Disneyland   it cannot guarantee the safety of young children with its poor and unsafe practice. There is an accident waiting to happen. Save your money and go to proper Disney World in Florida  it is a totally happy, safe and amazing experience.",Disneyland_Paris
119783904,2,2011-10,United Kingdom,"I visited Euro Disney with my mother and grandmother during a trip to Paris, and we all disliked the park very much. It was chaos and frantic with a very weird, charged atmosphere. Everywhere kids were begging their parents to but stuff and it was all about wanting more and more. You couldn't go there for a day because there was so much to do. This isn't a good thing, we all felt like we HAD to do it all, and there wasbn't enough time which gave us a weirdly panicked feeling. I went there when I was four years old and apperently hated it then as well, we went again to see if I would appreciate it more seeing as I am tall enough to go on the rides.It was good at first. There was a show with singing and dancing and it was very impressive with the big looming fairy palace and the pretty streets. We went to adventure land, and lined up for twenty minutes for a ride. Then there was pure confusion, as you got a ticket with a time on and could only go on the ride during that time. We thought we'd just go on the ride then so it was a bit of an anti climax to be given a ticket, but we looked at the map and saw that these rides are 'fast pass' rides. By then we felt a bit depressed about the place but were determined to have a good day... yeah right!It was chaos. Little children looked plain confused about the place, and personally I didn't get the concept. It's meant to be about magic and imagination but I thought it was an outdated and old fashioned idea. A twenty minute line was considered short, and the longest we waited was forty five minutes for a ride though people were waiting for an hour. The food was overpriced, kids were high on sugar and screaming, and unlike the last time I visited there was no interaction with characters. I remember meeting Snow White but we didn't see any of that. It was like a museum, you had to admire the set from a distance but you weren't part of it, for example the ride round the park we were expected to 'ooh' and 'aah' at stuffed animals in the 'wild.' I think children benefit more from hands on activities, especially if they're too short to go on rides.So we were fed up and went to the other park in the same sight, the Disney Studio Park. We liked it better, it was less busy with less kids running about and had a calmer, less frantic feel to it. in the other park it felt like we had to do everything and eat everything and buy everything. We waited for forty five minutes for the Rock and Rollercoaster only to hear a tannoy saying it had broken down and we'd have to wait another hour. We couldn't be bothered so the only thing we went on in that park was a Toy Story themed ride that would have been at home in my town's annual fair. There was a 'tram' studio tour that was in fact a lorry, and we drove and looked at things from films like 'Dinotopia'. There was a part when a barrel went on fire and the lorry rocked about but I wasn't very impressed.So overall, it's all about squeezing more money from parents as kids want to experience everything in one go. You'd have to stay there to experience everything at the park, but in somewhere as culture rich as Paris, who'd want to stay in Disneyland? I wasn't impressed at all. DO NOT waste your money there.",Disneyland_Paris

More than this, we visited the park in September and during week days. I know the queues are huge in July and during weekend.

The Park itself is great for kids but not for their parents...",Disneyland_Paris

119765373,2,2011-10,Italy,"It is not the 60 or 70 Euro per person that it costs, even though it doens'tcome for free, being a small park. If the Italians are terrible in organizing things, the French have done worst! 45minutes was the quickest line, 2hours the longest. Arrogant service.Fast pass would make life easier to the thousands of tourists that were at the park today,but they use it for 10% of the attractions (it is a reservation system to avoid cuing).Finally, we travelled a long trip to show Micky mouse to the young one, and guess what? At 13,lunch time, Micky disappeared to not show up again! So if you are not lucky enough to encounter him before lunch, you won't see him at all. Wefound a solution though.. the dinner at the 5 stars hotel in front of the park. 50 Europer person to eat with the Disney caracters and it was the worst food I have eaten in a long time!

Some of the rides were thrilling and left you asking for more.However long queues at some rides did put us off as did the high price of merchandise and food stuff. The park seemed to be teeming with shops selling the same merchandise. On the whole this place is good fun though I feel it is probably over rated and also overpriced.",Disneyland_Paris

I travelled here as a treat for my 13 yr old daughter.Maybe it seemed so bad as we have previously been to Disney in Florida but I think I would have still been somewhat dissapointed.Firstly,don`t bring in your own food,They take it out of your bag at the gates and act as if it is illegal substances that it being smuggled in!The staff a NOT friendly.No smiles,no nice way with children...nothing...dead facial expressions.They don`t attempt to organise the queues for character apperances and I seen many a small child pushed and shoved and ultimately walking away in tears.Characters themselves just left when they felt like it and they even pushed kids out of the way...Disney friendliness??? The park wasn`t that busy so we didn`t have to queue much which made it a bit bit more bearable.The place is full of shops selling all the same things in every shop.EUR 4 for and undrinkable coffee and EUR 15 for 2 inedible sandwiches.I am a smoker and there was designated smoking areas but people smoked everywhere...in queues and play areas,watching the shows etc...which isn`t nice for non smokers and young children.Nobody cares.The staff look like they have been forced into slave labour! The place is messy.littered and feels like a cheap fake (although it certainly isn`t cheap)!More maintenence is definately required as gardens and public areas are run down.Totally dissapointing and definately NOT the Disney dream :(",Disneyland_Paris
119711246,4,2011-10,United Kingdom,"An easy to navigate park, plenty to do, enough thrills and spills to keep all happy.  Too many shops selling the same stuff, and food quality could be much improved.",Disneyland_Paris
119672289,4,2011-10,Ireland,Only complaint with both parks is the cost of drinks snacks very excessive.  The amount iof merchandise on every corner made life a bit difficult as it seemed like I was saying no all day.,Disneyland_Paris
119655492,4,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Our kids aged 5 and 3 really enjoyed this trip, the disney parade which happens every day is not to be missed! Highlights included the Buzz lightyear ride, Star tours and the stars mission ride, Its a Small World, Peter Plan flight, The Haunted House, and the shows that take place throughout the day. Its a lot of fun, but vv busy with long lines at all the rides, so I think the best thing to do when you get there is print of your fastpass tickets at the rides that have fastpass machines then come back at the allotted time and you sail straight through to the rides, its brilliant! Snacks and food is expensive, (7 euros for a doughnut and two cookies!) and a lot of people make sandwiches from the breakfast buffet in their hotel and bring that. But there is every kind of food you could want at the disney parks, from pizza to a la carte. From reading the other reviews I thought smoking would be a real problem but actually people don't smoke in the lines but they do walk around smoking but to be honest it as not as bad as I thought it would be. You will get jostled about on the shuttle buses though, so soon as the doors open get on board don't wait! Its every scurvy pirate for himself!",Disneyland_Paris
119573181,3,2011-10,India,"Well... disneyland is fun fun and more fun! But let me advise you that don't make this disneyland the main reason for your visit to Paris coz you might be disappointed if you had already seen the Hong Kong Disneyland. the attractions are limited, face painting for kids also costs, the merchandises are pricey and the food are costlier even by European standard. So, go & have fun, but go without too much of an expectation. One more thing, the rides closes quite early and the photo shoots with the characters are less frequent and for very very short time. Anyways, have fun!",Disneyland_Paris

119451107,5,2011-10,United Kingdom,"I just waited to write a review as some people said how bad the place was but it was amazing. So great that I don't have time to tell you eveything. I went to Disneyland Paris on the 9th October and stayed till the 15th with my husband and my 3 year old boy and 2 year old girl. We had a wonderful time. We stayed at the Santa Fe hotel which is the cheapest hotel at Disney but is perfect as a base for sleeping at night and for breakfast. It is clean and the room was big enough for as all (with my 3 year old even getting a double bed to himself). As we were staying on site we got into the park 2 hours earlier which was great as we got on to some of the most popular rides before they got busy. (Although not all the rides open early) My kids loved the rides and their was plenty for them to go on to. We meet Mickey Mouse as soon as we got into the park on our first day and the cast member taking photo's was quite happy to use our camera so we all got our picture taken without having to buy the photo from the disney park which is expensive. We made up rolls from breakfast for our lunch as eating out is expensive.We usually only waited for 5 10 mins for the rides which was great. There was Autopia (in Discoveryland) which we had to wait for 30 mins and I didn't think it was worth it, although the kids loved it and Crush's coaster(in Toon Studio) which was 30 mins again but was worth it. We had booked for half board and there was a list of restaurants where we could eat out at and our favourite ones (although there was a few we didn't try) was the Silver Spur Steakhouse in Frontierland, Billy Bob's and Restaurant des Stars. There was always room for us and the restaurants were clean and the staff friendly.The shows were wonderful and the place was so clean (there was always someone swiping up and they were dressed up in the character of the theme of that area!) There was a few rides and area's which were closed as they were doing them up but both parks looked amazing and were done up for halloween which made them look even greater.Finally Dineyland is expensive for eating out but if you make up sandwichs and book for half board before you come then it dosn't cost anything for food apart from popcorn. Our kids were very young but they had a ball and the smile on there faces when they meet the characters was magical. My husband and I loved it too and got on the bigger rides with the baby switch. We will come back here again as we all had a magical time!!!",Disneyland_Paris
119426198,3,2011-10,Germany,"OK, so I knew what to expect from my own childhood visit in the US. And yes, the kids loved it just like I did then. But I definitely don't need to repeat my visit   it was loud, noisey, colourful and simply stimulus overload. It is quite unbelievable how the staff at Disney seem to be able to remain so friendly and interested at all times. Carefully picked and trained, it seems! We were there in the fall and it was fairly quiet with waiting times for rides usually only taking 10 20 minutes. But I shudder to think what it would be like in the summer. You get an impression of it by walking past the lines set up for waiting times of 1 hour and more and I simply cannot imagine spending your holiday doing that. Especially not with kids who are usually not very good at waiting. But if you are a fan of Disney and rides and don't mind waiting, it is a great thing.",Disneyland_Paris
119426195,1,2011-10,United Kingdom,"We are a family with two young children (6 & 3)   som might say that the 3 y o is probably too young to take to Disney and to a point they would be right, however having been to Florida parks previously (9 years ago) we expected the usual Disney quality would apply to Disneyland Paris Resort.Firstly, this is a very expensive holiday for a family. 4 nights at Sequoia Lodge inc flights from Edinburgh for the most basic room (two double beds with no means to have any privacy from your children!) cost   2100 through Thomas Cook.For that level of outlay, even with the price including hopper passes for both parks, you have a level of expectation.For me anyway, the experience should start the minute you interact with anything Disney   including the fully logo'd Disney transfer bus from the Airport   first impressions always count and at Paris CDG, we got off to a poor start.The driver was les than courteous   almost grumpy you could say, no help at all in putting our luggage on the bus and grunts with finger pointing were the only instructions we received about getting onto the bus itself.One on the bus its not much better   not sure how often they are cleaned, but the fold down tray our daughter was sitting at had very old chewing gum stuck to it.The transfer tot he resort is actually quite short   around 40 minutes. The lodge looks nice as you arrive and we started to feel more positive about our holiday.The main reception is spacious and has a lodge feel, so high marks for creating a believable environment.Check in was fairly slow, quite a big que   this is something you need to get used to on this holiday believe me!Your park tickets are allocated at reception, but no information about hotel facilities including internet access or pool area was given at that time. I suspect they did not have enough staff on reception to cope with arrivals and time was a premium   its not a major issue, just an observation, but attention to detail none the less.The room was located about a 5 minute walk from the main building in one of the lodges and its a pleasant walk down through well maintained woodland.The entrance to the lodge was a bit of a shock   very tired looking, peeling and very chipped paint everywhere and not very clean   our room was on the 1st floor up two flights of stairs   try man handling heavy suitcases up with no lift option   not good either.The room also looked tired and in need of refurbishment inside   I have stayed in B&B that was infinitely better. The bathroom was adequate with postage stamp bath towels.The room had chipped furniture and two double beds for 4 of us   I had watched a promo video of the lodge before arriving that showed the kids with bunk beds and a curtain to be drawn for additional privacy, so this was a bit of a disappointment. Other than that, the room was spacious enough.One thing which was more to do with who else was in the other rooms     there is a LOT of noise up and down the corridor at night, which was problematic in getting our 3 y o daughter off to sleep at night.We arrived around teatime so we decided to head into the Village to get something to eat. The Hard Rock Caf   always has an appeal, so we chose to eat there.As a side point, you learn very quickly that you will sped a fortune eating out. A meal for 4 people (2 children, 2 adults) costs on average 80 Euros with a couple of drinks. That   s for one main course for adults and children   s menu which is a main plus sweet. The furniture inside looks tired and needs renewing upgrading. Other than that, the quality of food was excellent and the staff were friendly with quick and attentive service. Next day was our first day at the park and we decided to take in the main Disneyland Park. As one other reviewer said, it looks really impressive as you walk up and you get a sense of something special, however this is a veneer over something that desperately needs some kind of update. The park did not seem that clean and the toilets were at best horrible and mostly disgusting. One did not have any means to dry your hands (Pizza Planet).I could write about each individual attraction, but here is the good the bad and the ugly as far as family rides are concerned, its pretty much a given that the main rides (Space Mountain etc are really impressive). GOOD: Pirates of the Caribbean     well thought out and a great atmosphere. BAD: Autopia     it would look more at home in Butlins and for that matter a Butlins in need of upgrading. UGLY: Peter Pans Flight     we had to que over 40 minutes for this garbage     the ride was out of commission on two occasions we went there (as were a number of rides that seemed to have lot of technical issues). The ride takes you above the rooftops in a very jerky and almost ready to break down fashion. Maybe OK 13 years ago, but has no place in what should be the magic of Disney     this promised so much     the leaflet says        hop on to a Pirate ship and fly off on an unforgettable journey to Never Land    unforgettable right enough and should be called    never ever again land   .The other thing that takes getting used to is the ques, the constant barging, people almost running between rides like their life depended on it and people pushing in. Happy family day out? What do you think? The food inside the park is expensive beyond belief     talk about milking a captive audience     Disney     you should be ashamed of yourself      ..All in all I would rate this park a 2 10.Disney Studios park is marginally better, although the    Slinky Dog Zigzag Spin     enjoy the thrills on this zigzag coaster    (from the leaflet) involved a 40 minute que for less than 60 seconds on the ride itself!!!! That   s completely crazy     it seems that people (us included) as happy to que huge amounts of time to go on rides that are less than average.The car stunt show was brilliant and our 6 y o Elliot loved seeing Lightning McQueen in the flesh     the stunts were spectacular and it lives up to its billing.Each morning we had to que for around 20 minutes just to get into the restaurant for breakfast     how can that be? I have never ever stayed in a hotel and had to que up for breakfast. Too many guests and the facilities are unable to cope.Would be go back ? Absolutely never in a millions years, unless of course many of the above issues were addressed.Value for money? God no, by the time we took into account what we spent just on food when we were there, we spend   600 per day for something in dire need of some TLC and Mickeys magic wand         .",Disneyland_Paris

119396864,5,2011-10,United Kingdom,"we visited for the 3rd time, returning only yesterday and once again we had a fab time! we attended the mickeys not so scarey halloween party and it was worth every penny to be able to get on the rides and have so many character pictures, we had a blast. The parks are very well kept and always have people cleaning up. You really do get into the spirit of disney. My only bug bears are the lack of manners from kids and adults when queing for rides or autographs...personal space is not respected at all i wish they had a civilised system for these things as it drives me mad! Also the halloween decorations were really scaled back this year which is a real shame as it looked so special last year!! Also i wish the park closed later as i feel it was to early to be back at the hotel. Other than that this is a special special place made even better by traveling by eurostar...how easy!",Disneyland_Paris
119389075,4,2011-1,United Kingdom,"I know its the continent, and they do a lot of things different to us brits. I can tolerate the lack of manners, the body odour and even the ladies hairy armpits, but SMOKING AROUND CHILDREN is not acceptable. My son suffers from asthma, and the last thing he needs is to be breathing in the smoke of strangers at every turn. Apart from this, the park and rides were very enjoyable. Although looking tired and in need of a revamp (the park is still running at a major loss for Disney) we had a lot of fun. WARNING   The food in the park is pretty dire, a poor take on american culture.",Disneyland_Paris
119372453,1,2011-6,United Kingdom,"Having lived in Paris as a child, I visited Disneyland Paris numerous times and absolutely loved it. The place was so big and magical, with friendly Disney characters wandering around, happily taking photos with you and having a friendly chat.How times have changed! I went recently with friends and I failed to see any Disney characters walking around taking casual photos with their young fans. A few big rides were shut and strangely, there was an old Michael Jackson 3D experience which was (frankly) a huge waste of time! The place seemed shabby, the staff indifferent. To top off this disappointing experience, me and my friends were harassed by a group of males in one of the queues for a ride! It's hard to find anything  magical  about horrible blokes inappropriately touching you saying disgusting things to you in a confined space. We complained to a member of staff and pointed out the offenders and the reaction we received was shocking. It was plain that this member of staff couldn't care less!Based on my personal experience, I wouldn't recommend Disneyland Paris to anyone. It seriously lacks decent customer service and the old Disney magic ...",Disneyland_Paris
119367950,2,2011-9,United Kingdom,"We booked to go to Paris from 12th 14th, arriving in the morning and flying home in the evening so we had 3 full days at the parks. We also booked the half board meal plan, so we did not have to worry about searching for somewhere to eat our evening meals. Things started to go wrong once we got to the hotel, where we discovered work was being done on our lodge, right outside our bedroom window, the workmen   s faces were right at our window, so we felt we had no privacy. The keys given to us were very temperamental and at one point we were locked outside our room for over half an hour, eventually we were given new keys. The bath and shower did not work, so we were unable to bath shower the whole time we were there, which was very uncomfortable and there were no drinks facilities or anywhere to store cold drinks either. I have never been in a hotel that does not offer either a fridge or kettle, and for the amount it costs to stay at Disney, to not have basics was unsatisfactory. In the brochure and at the hotel it says that there are Disney channels for the children to watch in the rooms, the English Disney channel did not work in our room, much to the disappointment of our children, only the news and the information channel worked.On our second night I mentioned my thoughts to the concierge hoping that some of this may be sorted out for us, especially the bath water, however nothing was done and we received no apology from management, we were just given a booklet to fill in for internal use only asking about our stay in Disney and what we liked best.As I mentioned earlier we booked the half board menu, which I deeply regretted. In the past I had heard that the food was fantastic, I now realise that they were talking about Disney land in America! Paris may share the name Disney, however I feel that the standards are extremely miles apart. Our children did not enjoy their meals and the only fresh items on my husbands and my plate were the meat. The vegetables were either out of a tin or had previously been cooked and re heated, they were soft and soggy, the service in the hotel was good though. For the second meal we decided to eat in the Disney Village to see if the food was any better, yet another reget! We went to the Steakhouse, which looked to be of a high standard. Table booked for 9.15, seated at 9.30 and were brought our drinks at 10.10pm. The kids were served their main meal before we were even served our starter. Both our daughters left their meals, one was raw in the middle the other was just horrible to taste and when our starters arrived, Cesar salad, we were extremely let down, lettuce which was old and the leaves were brown, half a cherry tomato and parmesan shavings with a little dressing. We sat and waited ages for them to be taken away, the waiter looked at the plates and could see we were not happy and not eating but did nothing to care why? My husband and I ordered steak, as we were in a steakhouse we had thought that it should be good, how wrong we were. The waiters decided to serve the table next to us their steaks even though they had arrived much after us, they saw we were looking and not too happy so they brought two of the steaks to us, as my husband started to cut the steak, he saw it was well done, he had asked for medium rare, so the waiter took one off the next table and swapped the steaks, I cut into mine and that was not right either, again the waiter just swapped with another person on the next table, none of us could believe our eyes. As one of my daughters had not eaten any of her food, I gave her some of my steak, which she nearly choked on as it was so chewy, most of the meals were left.We then asked for desert hoping that may be edible, I asked if on my crumble I could have custard instead of ice cream, he said custard is for children and no I could not have it, even though it was available. The only item that was wholly consumed was the Ben and Jerrys ice cream, a few bread rolls and our drinks. When we went to pay for our drink and hand in our meal tickets, I tried to speak to a woman their about our meal and she just looked at me and walked away, the receipt showed the meal came to 95 euro and if I had not already pre paid I can say that I would not have paid for that shambolic meal. I prepaid   160.00 for two evening meals which I deeply regret and will think twice about it in the future. I would just like to say that my experience at Disneyland Paris was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons, it was meant to be the holiday of a lifetime, but we could not wait to get home, the service has let the Disney name down, I was hoping to come back from my holiday to have lots of great things to say however I feel that the bad far outweighed the good.The best part of the trip were the studios. I think that it should have the disney name stripped, as I am sure Disney himself would be ashamed if he took a visit there, it is awful to say we learn by mistakes, mine was a costly one, the good thing is we have some great photos!",Disneyland_Paris

119357551,5,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Me, my sister in law, and 3 children aged 4,6 & 9, we all had a fantastic time. We made good use of our 5 day pass, going straight into the Disney park after checking in to the Magic Explorers hotel which was fab, very clean and rooms were a good size for the amount of time we spent in there. The breakfast had to be booked into a time slot as it is a busy hotel but this ensured that guests were spaced out so the restaurant wasn't too packed. We went at 8am and never had to wait for anything other than to use the toaster, thet could do with a second one at busy times, other than that it was great, a good choice of food to eat, somethinmg for everyone. The pool was great if a bit chilly for me but great for the kids with the slides and big water bucket that emptied over the pool every 2 minutes! The indoor playarea was a godsend for the children while we chilled out at the end of the day with a drink. Would definitely stop there again. Also, it is 1st on the pink shuttle bus route so getting on the bus even at peak times was never a problem. The park was fantastic, as good as I remember it from 2 years ago when we went. A great new addition was Princess Pavillion where you can go & meet 2 surprise princesses, have your photo took with them etc, though tyhe queue was often long, the setting makes it worthwhile. Another must is Its A Small World, we had to go on in 3 times for my youngest, think she wanted to live there! For older children then Space Mountain 2 & The of Terror in the Studios are great, though not for the faint hearted. We still haven't been on all the rides in our 2 visits as there is always so much going on with the parades, dance shows etc. Stitch Live was a fabulous show, a must for all ages, it had me in stitches! We went to see a Motion Stunt Spectacular where they showed how films do car stunts, it was explosive to say the least & my 9 year old loved it,I couldn't possibly write about everyting to do here, or describe how magical it is to see your children's face when their favourite character appears or they see Sleeping Beauty's Castle for the 1st time, you just have to see for yourselves. The only downside is the price of food & drinks etc in both the hotels & the parks, but we took plenty of snacks & drinks with us to help, & the Disney shops are expensive but it didn't stop our enjoyment at all. Will be saving up to again ASAP.",Disneyland_Paris
119337826,4,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Just returened from disneyland Paris and loved it. Went with myself,daughter aged 13 and daughter aged 8. Stayed at the santa fe, had a bit of trouble finding it on foot but once we knew where we were was a nice walk up and down to the village and parks and never once used the bus service. Hotel was clean,warm and comfortable and fresh towels,soap etc were provided each day. Breakfast was fine though busy but we got in each morning without a wait.Only thing slightly off at breakfast was the birds flying round but we saw these in Mcdonalds as well.  The parks involve a lot of walking.We spent two days at disneyland park and a day at walt disney studios then the last day tried to do things we had missed. Longest q was at crushes coaster and no attractions were closed. WE went to buffalo bill show one evening and i consider this probably the only thing we wasted money on. It cost 165 euros for me and the girls, my youngest enjoyed it butmyself and my daughter just kind of zoned out after the first five minutes. Atmosphere is good though, you get a cowboy hat,which you keep, and dinner which was ok, also free beer,coke or water all evening. We also ate in cafe mickey, the dinner on our first night was great, loads of characters and they come to your table and have photos,sign autographs etc, we were all like kids in there.The food was fine, but fairly pricey, we didn't have the set menu but just chose off the menu what we wanted. My youngest had the kids menu but is not a great eater and left most of it, the kids pudding is basically sweets and in my opinion the 18 euros was expensive for what she had. The dinner was much better than the lunch we had in there for characters.All the characters were great considering how mobbed they get and though it was fairly quiet when we were there prepare to be pushed and shoved a bit. Some of the characters,or rather their minders do make all the kids and adults move back and then the character will pick kids to come up for a photo, luckily my daughter is quite shy so as she stood nicely got chosen pretty quickly all the time. In the stitch show we were just about to sit down when a grown man literally ran, and i mean ran, from behind us and shoved us out of the way so be prepared to stand your ground.The parade is lovely especially for the kids but is the same every day so see it once then go and get on rides while everyone else is watching it. The small world ride is a must,it really is fantastic and my liitle one enjoyed going through it in the boat, this was the only ride we went on more than once, it does have q's but they move pretty fast. I couldn't go on alot of the bigger rides because the little one didn't want to, but my eldest went on them all and loved them. Favourite characters were the green army men from toystory who were totally brilliant, The queen of hearts and pluto who all in my opinion put in that litlle bit extra to make it more magical.Downsides... pushing and shoving, alot of the staff do not speak english, trying to understand the maps ( though we did kind of get the hang of it in the end). My biggest would be that after the parks shut at 7pm there really isn't that much to do, disney village is open but consists mainly of shops and food. There is ice skating of your poor feet can stand it, which ours couldn't and the buffalo bill show which is 6.30 or 9.30 but if you have kids with you not much else. All the shops sell the same stuff and most is expensive. We did find a few different souveniers in the shop at the rain forest cafe which was good.My best bit was when you first walk into the parks, especially the disneyland park, it really is like being in an old film amd mainstreet was probably my favourite place. Overall we had a great stay and i would go again, i do think we got lucky as october so it wasn't that busy, it did get busier as the week went on and the thursday was the most crowded day so i imagine the weekends are pretty busy, but the weather was good and not even cold. I can however state with certainty that i would not visit in peak times or school holidays as it is easy to imagine what mayhem it would be.Top tips....... do take a few bread rolls etc at breakfast, everyone does and it saves you lots as snacks are expensive, you walk so much the kids get hungry quickly and it gives your feet a rest if you can sit and feed them for a little while, we took our own crisps and sweets etc.Have good shoes and be prepared to walk and stand alot. Once you know your way around you find the quickest ways but still involves a lot of walking.Watch the parade once, it's always the same and gives you valuble time to get on busier rides while everyone is watching it.Remember that due to the costumes alot of the characters cannot see right in front of them so alot of the pushers and shovers can't be seen anyway. Inour experience if you stand at the front but quietly and calmly you get a lot further.Always have you camera, you never know when a character will appear.Overall remain calm amd relaxed and just enjoy, sure you could spend a lot of money but you don't have to, if a ride, food place is busy just walk away for ten minutes and go back and the q's are usually gone.",Disneyland_Paris
119245528,3,2011-10,United Kingdom,"No idea why, but we expected more fun for the price paid. One day is not enough for one park, there are long lines to each attraction (except the houses).

119120918,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,Love    The atmosphere as I walked around was fantastic. As I walked into I was greeted by a brass band playing Disney classics.  The q's were not a problem the longest I had to wait was 35 min. They moved quickly.  In my opinion the Indiana Jones ride was the best. It was fast and the loop the loop just made the ride.  Disney Paris was my favourite activity on my trip to Paris.  HateThen choice of food. It's all fast food no real verity. Still the food I had was fine.NotesGetting to Disney via the metro is straight forward. It takes around 45min from Paris. Make sure that you get the correct ticket to get you to Disney. Many people make the mistake of using zone one tickets to get through the metro barriers in Paris. On arrival at Disney there are ticket conductors that may fine individuals on arrival for traveling without the correct ticket,Disneyland_Paris
119112494,4,2011-10,United Kingdom,"Disney is Disney and the park entertained the younger children and the teenagers. It has had some updates since we went last year (I did write to complain about the state of the paths as we took a visually imparied teenager with us) There are still problems with the paths, even worse on the approach. But it doesnt take away from the enjoyment that our grandchildren had on their first Disney experience.",Disneyland_Paris
119102876,4,2011-7,United States,"Walking into this park you forget you are in Paris. It is VERY similar to Disneyland Anaheim.

119090806,4,2010-11,Trinidad and Tobago,"Its my very first time to see Disneyland and got so lucky that it was in Paris. Travel time is maybe about an hour and a half since i just took a bus ride from Charles de Gaulle Airport. (better to ride the train...which is faster.)Well, the bus was travelling at a moderate pace since most of the passengers were foreign tourists. Not much to see along the road except for fields of green which im sure most of us were used to. Got there around 11am and immediately bought a 24hr pass. Its a very long walk going inside the theme park but your eyes would be full. You will feel like a child again. Many shops offering different variety of food and souvenirs. Since the park is big with so many attractions, it would be best to come early and stay up late. Maybe staying in one of the disney hotels would be a good option especially if you have kids with you. The park staff were friendly & always comes with a smile....and most willing to take your picture for you !",Disneyland_Paris
119040051,2,2011-9,Czechia,"We have visited three parks during this summer, Disneyland Paris was the last one. I was really looking forward to coming back after almost 10 years since my first visit and was expecting it to be the best one. Unfortunately it was complete opposite, for double price it was the worst park we visited this summer.What went wrong? First some of the major attractions were closed. We were not even told at the entrace, you have to go back all the way to the attraction to find out it is closed. 4 attractions were closed.Another pretty bad thing was food. All the smaller outside stands were closed so only few inside places were opened. All places were packed and the service was so inefficient. When there were 4 people remainig in the line it took 20minutes to get to the counter and then another 5minutes waiting for cheeburger where you even have to put the sauce on yourself! What a joke and rip off for the price.Also unfortunately in 10 years almost nothing changed there were just two new attractions. And some attractions were looking pretty outdated, example, these days 3D cinema is pretty normal thing and in Disneland you get almost 25years old show with MJ and they expect you to go Wooow from that? Overall the park needs to improve a lot in terms of service and many attractions needs to be refurbished. Not sure if we ever go again, as said there are much better parks with lots more fun in Europe! Even my girlfriend who is not picky and rarely complains was pretty upset and disappointed. They make living out of known Disney characters, but is it enough for such a park and price?",Disneyland_Paris
119034944,1,2011-9,Spain,"Went with my Grandson and his family (my great grand children) age 10, 6, and almost 3 years. Having been to Disneyland Anneheim, I was expecting something similar. No chance!. It cost a fortune just for a simple meal and to have a priority and not queue it cost    40 per person so adults were getting onto the rides and children were queueing for up to 1hr.45mins for some attractions (one day the temperature was 33c and the other day it rained so hard non stop for 2 3 hours) There were no rides for small children and the rides there were limited anyway. To see some of the Disney stars we had to ask how and when they were available and to arrange to see more than one in one area we had to pay    34 for a meal for adults and    18 for children in Mickeys Restaurant so they could have their photoa taken with stars. In the stores they concentrated on Mickey and Minnie mouse and there were very limited articles on things like Woody and Buzz and shelves were not stocked from the previous day..The maps provided were inaccurate and we walked aound for ages trying to find the Arena where the Stunt Cars performed ( The best thing there!) as there were no staff members to advise us. Nothing was organised and we were shoved out of the way queueing to enter the gates at opening time. four gates and at least one thousand people pushing and shoving not queueing and my gt.grandson of 6 years was pushed to the ground by a woman and looked angry when we shouted.All in all a disapointing and expensive trip. I later discovered it was a Franchise for a French company and not Disney USA",Disneyland_Paris

118959033,1,2011-8,United Kingdom,"I am a Grandad.I attended Eurodisney with my Wife,Daughter,Son in law,three Grandaughters aged 12 weeks, three years,Six years.On the walk up to Eurodisney from the train station Eurodisney looks impressive.We had already pre booked our entry tickets so we did not have to take part in the massive ques just to get in.Once you walk in the place looks breath takingly impressive the colours music coming fromspeakers than as you get further in you realise that is it.NO one walking around dressed as Mickey Mouse,Snow White or any Disney characters. No small rides for my Grandaughters to go on by themselves. It was decided I should take one of my Grandaughters on the flying Elephant ride.We queued One and a Half Hours by the time our turn came my young grandaughter had had enough in the heat needing refreshment not wanting to go on.We found out later you can buy a special pass costing the equivalent   130 so you can jump the que at the rides.We All decided we would go on the train that goes around the perimeter so you can look down and see everything. Buggies were not allowed on,you have to leave your   200 buggy on the pavement beside one of the make shift station entrance hoping it will still be there when you come off?There were people dressed as the Disney characters in enclosures your child could have their photo taken with them.The queue was an hour  .The prices you will pay for goods16.95 euro   15.40p for a base ball cap for the little ones that has Eurodisney on the front. 3 Euro   2.70 for a Toffee apple.My two Grandaughter were promised a Disney dress each the cost 75 Euro (  67.50p) back home at the Disney shop at the Metro Centre Gateshead the same dresses   28.50pThe whole place is a rip off NOT value for money for what you pay from hard earned cash.Once you are in that   s it they have you.You can leave at any time and be a Meany or just pay up and don't think about how much it costs in sterling.We were sitting in one of the cafe style restraunts mu daughter said to me  Dad this is a Day from Hell   . Sitting next to us was a couple with a child from Liverpool. The woman voiced into hour conversation saying   What did you say, a day from hell. I totally agree   . They then went on to tell us about their experiences at Eurodisney and it was as horrific as ours.They said like us they will never return to Eurodisney again.The place reminded me of the set from a TV series called the Prisoner starring Patrick Mcgoohan.The only difference was, once you were out there was no big bubble sent to bring you back.",Disneyland_Paris
118886711,3,2011-9,United Kingdom,"Before Disneyland Paris I had been to Walt Disney World Florida 3 times, I decided to go to Paris with an open mind and not compare the two resorts. I was excited to see the Disney magic that Paris had to offer...unfortunatley the magic in Paris is nonexistentFor me, the only enjoyable part of the trip were the rides, they were so much fun Tower of Terror, Rock n Roller Coaster, Crucsh's Coaster, Space Mountain to name but a few!..If we had the parks to ourselves then it would have been the perfect trip!..the atmosphere in both parks are COMPLETLEY DIFFERENT from the parks in Florida, in Paris people shove u, jump the ques, walk in front of you when you are taking photos etc, the members of staff on the rides and in the restaraunts barely look at you never mind smile at you!..another down side to the parks is the food prices, when it comes to food Disneyland Paris is a complete rip off!!..I usually don't mind splurging a bit on holiday but when you are paying    50 for 3 hot dogs, 3 portions of chips and 3 cokes it is an absolutle joke! and your money dissapears fast. In Florida the staff members can't do enough for you, they are so friendly and chatty and really make you feel welcome..we DID NOT feel welcome in Disneyland Paris at all.I was extremley dissapointed with Disneyland Paris and I think it should be ashamed to carry the Disney name!. Please save your money and go to Florida instead where you will have the time of your life and will not be ripped off and treated like dirt!",Disneyland_Paris
118875107,4,2011-9,United Kingdom,"Went to Euro Disney on Thursday 08 09 2011 for 4 days flying from Glasgow with Easy Jet, with the missus and 6 year old son. Arrived at De Gaulle and met a nice chap who offered to take myself, wife and 6 year old to the resort for less than the Bus  50 Euros, so it was ideal. Got to the resort in 25 mins. Stayed at the Santa Fe and check in was easy peasy  10 mins. The reason I satyed at the Santa Fe is that it is cheaper than the others and your there to enjoy the park not the room so why pay more? Went into the park for a recce the first day via the shuttle bus and got on some rides. They search your bag at the entrance to the park, I think it is for drink, and there can be some delays dependent on how good the staff are. After the park closed went into the Disney Village and went straight to Mickey D's (McDonalds) as the wee chap was done in. There is also a place called Earl of Sandwich which sells, well, sandwiches. Also took in Buffalo Bills show and was worth every penny. Great food, beer top ups, and Cowboys and Injuns  Yeehaw!!!! You can also bang on the plates and tables, something my son keeps up back at home much to my dismay!At the Santa Fe it is a ticket system for Breakers and you can choose what time you go at  45 min slots, but you can also eat IN the park, but it is limited. We made our lunch up in the resturant in the morning, taking bread rolls with meats and cheeses on it and basically sneaked them out every day. No one complained or stopped us although there are signs saying not to.....should learn to pay attention. I would recommend the hire of the childs buggys lifesavers, but bring a bicycle chain lock as people steal yours!!!!When, not if, I go back I will go Mon Thu and not at the weekend. The place is mobbed and you can wait upwards 90mins for some rides  even the fast pass tickets were for4 5 hrs away. Recommend Hollywood Towers, Thunder mountain,Nemo ride, Buzz lightyear, Animagic Show, Toyland in fact it all. Downside is that some of the rides are a bit dated but hey you can't have it all or can you??",Disneyland_Paris
118845405,5,2011-9,Greece,"The things you can say about Disneyland are quite simple. No, it's not only for kids. I could say that is for kids of all ages (cliche). Come early, not weekends wednesdays  summer christmas, otherwise you will have to wait. A lot. Book your visit online a week earlier as it is cheaper and trust me you will need the money. Bring your own food if you want to save more. Don't eat before the roller coasters! Try to see everything. There is nothing childish or simple. Everything is an artwork created for your fun and yes, you want to wear that hat or get lost on the maze of Alice in Wondeland. The stuff is great, although some they don't speak english fluently but they are really helpful. Take your children after the age of five as they could live the experience it much better. See the parade (check the program) , buy a souvenir (or more), take a last glance of this magic land and go back to the real world with a huge smile. Until the next time.",Disneyland_Paris
118825776,4,2011-9,United Kingdom,"I must say I am surprised at all the negative comments about Disneyland Paris. We are just back after a 4 night stay, flying from Edinburgh. All booked through the Disneyland Paris Direct.com website which was really easy and stress free. Yes, its incredibly expensive even when you get one of the supposed 50% off deals with free child place ( which we did by going in term time) and to be honest, we paid the same as 11 nights all inclusive for 3 in Ibiza as we did for this trip on a B&B basis at the Disneyland hotel. Prices for food and drinks are really expensive too when you get there but as long as you know this in advance you hopefully won't get too much of a shock and be prepared forit. Best place we found to eat for snacks ( Croque Monsieur   6 euro !) was Caseys on Main Street and the Earl of Sandwich in Disney village which served lovely hot fresh subs, way better than some of the meals in other restaurants. Beware the Mickey Cafe   while the entertainment is fab for little ones with all the characters coming to your table for pics autographs, the food was deep fried rubbish and we ended up with a bill for   60 for fish and chips, turkey and baked potatoe and childrens burger and chips. Gordon Ramsay would have had a field day.... The smile on my little ones face helped ease the ouch factor when paying the bill slightly.We stayed in the Disneyland hotel right in the park which was wonderful, lovely breakfasts with chance to meet the characters at breakfast time. We also got into the park 2 hours before it opened each day which cut out the queue to get in, but once in it was restricted as we could only really get access to some of the rides around the castle   dumbo's teacups etc as we were not given access to other parks ( although we were under this impression) Be warned as a lot of people were fooled by this. It was still great to get into the park early though and have a dance down Main Street when it was quiet. Avoid weekends if you can, the Sunday we arrived was manic with locals visiting for the day but the Mon, Tues and Wed were a lot quieter. Longest we queued was 45 mins for Dumbos and 50 mins for Thunder Mountain. ( which was scarier than I remembered from Florida   not best for 5 year olds in retrospect!) The time spent queuing is longer than time on the round   2 minutes max most of the time. The hot air balloon is fab too but again you are only up for a few minutes.Overall brilliant, magical holiday and some fantastic memories for myself, partner and 5 year old. This park is great for this age group   don't think I will venture back to Florida until my daughter is a bit older as Paris is exhausting enough for them at that age. Just be realistic and if you want to go accept it ain't cheap but you will have a magical time, go outwith school holidays and go mid week instead. I would definately go back to the Disneyland hotel as it did seem the best compared to the others nearby.",Disneyland_Paris

118731258,4,2011-9,Australia,"I think the fun is proportional to the size of the crowd. Weekends and holidays will be extremely busy. Most French school children have Wednesday off, so that will be busy. Tuesdays is the day off for Belgian school children, so a little busy. Monday and Thursday appear to be the best days to go.I went with my wife and three children on Tuesday Sept 27th, and while I was surprised at the large number of people there, the longest we queued for was 20 minutes on the non fastpass rides and 10 minutes using fastpass. We rode all the rides in Disneyworld, but would not have had time to go to Disney Studios as well in a single day.My tips are:1. Go off peak (in you live in Paris, take the kids out of school for the day)2. Learn how to use fastpass immediately upon arriving3. Take your own sandwiches, drinks etc (bags go through a security x ray, but they were not searched for food. Drinking fountains are located at all toilets to refill bottles. On Tuesday there were lots of places to sit and eat lunch inside the park.4. If you live in France, check the French Disney website   tickets can be booked 5 days in advance for    30 for adults and children.Other things I noticed:1. Disneyland didn't look brand new, but it did not look old and dated.2. There were some smokers, but no more than you would pass walking along a Parisian street.3. Some staff were friendly, others were neutral. I saw them deal well with a couple of thoughtless visitors and can understand why they may be irritated at times.4. The park and its toilets were clean. I saw the toilets being cleaned during the day and they were a little smelly by the end of the day; but they were being used by thousands of people.Personally, I found the morning stressful, but started to relax towards lunch and then began enjoying myself during the afternoon. Hopefully I never have to go back. The kids loved it.",Disneyland_Paris
118689353,4,2011-9,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from 4 full days in the Disneyland Parks and had a fantastic time.Having read a lot of negative reviews on here I was a bit apprehensive about our trip but have to say it was much better than I expected. The toilets in the park were clean albeit a little smelly but I never had to queue for the ladies. The bins were emptied regularly in the park and we often saw members of staff sweeping and gardening. The Disneyland Parks are very expensive but we expected this before we went. Food and drinks can cost on average 6 euro for a hotdog and 3 euro for a drink. We would recommend Casey   s hotdogs on Main Street, these were very nice!There are a lot of souvenir shops in the Parks and prices range from3 euro a fridge magnet to 5 euro a keying and 20 euro for a soft toy.Children   s outfits are very expensive in resort, on average 60 euro each so my advice would be to buy them before you go as all of the smaller children walk around the parks in the Disney costumes. We saw lots of characters in both of the parks and there were lots of photo opportunities. We never waited longer than about 10 15 minutes for each ride and we went on every ride in both the Disneyland Park and Disney Studios in 4 days. The only ride we waited 45 minutes for was Big Thunder Mountain which was well worth the wait. Make use of fast pass tickets which are free and gives you a time to return to the ride to avoid long queues. We enjoyed Crushers Coaster and all of the smaller rides such as Mad Hatters Teacups and Pirates of the Caribbean together with Tram Tour in Disney Studio Park. Check the official Disneyland Paris website before you travel to see what times the parks close, parade times and also which rides are closed for refurbishment maintenance before you travel to avoid disappointment.The parades were great, make sure you arrive for the parades early to get a spot at the front for a very good view. The Once Upon a Time main parade started at 5pm every day when we were there, we sat on the kerb outside the Disneyland Castle at 4.30pm and had an excellent view at the front. We would definitely return again in the future     take lots of energy and money with you.",Disneyland_Paris
118686971,5,2010-12,United Kingdom,"Having worked at Disneyworld in florida i was expecting paris to come up a little short, however if i'm honest, i prefer this magic kingdom park to florida, with the exception of the weather. It is such a beautiful place. Sure the service isnt quite on the same level as florida and the french speaking staff can be a little rude to tourists, especially if you dont speak french, but at the end of the day, you are in france. The attractions in this park are i think better then any other disney park. although i do miss splash mountain. The park was immaculate, no rubbish around, excellent food services and stores all over. the shows are incredible as usual with any disney park. The only downside was the temperature, december in paris is very very cold and so hard to completely enjoy the parks.

As of my view I didn't find it's interesting! because It must have many games not rare games!!!! Also the Time it's to early to close!!! 7:00 pm!!

Hotel was approx 1 hour from resort depending on the driver ! Lack of info from Urquhart was terrible driver would not give us an eta at the Channel Tunnel, which he must have known as we later found out we were booked on a train @ 7 20pm, no arrival time @ hotel, which was just as well we drove round in circles for hours as they got lost They then told us we would not leave for the park next day until 10 30 to suit their driving hours as they had been driving that week already and only had limited hours left. When we did arrive at the park they issued us with tickets with incorrect date we did not get into the park until 2pm. Drivers attitude was   not my fault it was Disney! He then told us they wanted to leave @ 10 30 on Sunday   after a phone call back to Scotland to speak to their office there was a change of mind and we left @ 9am. When we left on Monday the short cut the driver took was a disaster and we arrived at a bridge they could not go under and had to reverse back up a hill with a blind bend   was ridiculous and dangerous   there was a total lack of info from Urquhart all the way on this tour This same trip was taken with another tour operator 2 years ago with no problems Urquhart was chosen as they were a reputable company with a competitive price   as they say price isn't everything   customer satisfaction should play a large part of your customer charter After all the drama it has to be said the park itself was great. You could eat a 2 course meal eg pasta & garlic bread with soft drink for 11 euros bottle soft drink was 2.60 euros would definately go back with different operator",Disneyland_Paris
118657397,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,"We went there for 4 days spent 3 nights. Arriving on Sunday evening via the Eurostar and TGV and leaving on Wednesday morning in the reverse order. We stopped at the Hotel New York which is well placed from the park about 5 mins walk and was part of the Disney Village. On arrival at the train station at Disneyland it was hard to find the direction of the hotel as there was no visible signs up. We had to wait for the free shuttle bus provided which took a about 30 mins to arrive and was full maybe we had just missed one. At this point it was very hot it was like being in the Caribbean. I wore boots because the weather report said there would be thunderstorms there was none thankfully.Once I checked into the hotel I was given a fast pass for both parks for the duration of my stay. After this it was about 10pm when we made our way to the Disneyland Park just following the crowd and was in a good position to film the Parade and Fireworks. These you can see on youtube http:www.youtube.com watch?v eGDN5ws 3vY and http:  www.youtube.com watch?v  RpVZOZysUc&feature related . The pass allow early entrance to both parks at 8am but in reality in the main park only a few attractions open then, most open at 10am. The Disney Studio didn't seem to open before 9.30am so a pointless allowance. Water is very expensive there and in the village. The cheapest place to get this is at the small shop at the railway station.A major disappointment was the lack of non Disney character shops. There are no chemist nor supermarkets so bring everything you need. The restaurants in the village are very expensive. In short the parks are good but the facilities as mentioned could be better. The Trains were filthy inside, very dirty but the hotel was good.",Disneyland_Paris

Everywhere there is a key for 90 minutes minimum, so called  fast passes  are also scheduled for 2 hours ahead. The result is walking around in horrendous crowd, queuing everywhere.

We arrrived on Wednesday and went straight to park   my daughter's face when she saw Disney castle was priceless! Midweek was much quieter, we were there on Saturday and it was packed. if you are going, try to book midweek. Fast pass is really useful, we used this as much as we could. I am 6 months pregnant and was able to get a pink pass which let me skip some queues on certain rides. The Buzz Lightyear laser blast was really, went on that a few times! All rides were great, my daughter even went on the Toy Story parachtue drop twice   Dad was not so keen. It is very tiring though, we arrived at 10am and left about 6.30pm   the day just flew in.

118618213,1,2011-9,United Kingdom,"I have been to Disneyland and Disneyworld many times and really enjoyed the experience so was really looking forward to my first holiday in 2 years at Disney Paris. Unfortunately it felt as though the ethos of Disney had evaporated leaving just the signage. Rides didn't open, broke down repeatedly or closed early. Weeds grew from some of the building in the lands and on Main Street. Many cracks and pits were evident in the pavement flooring, posing significant trip hazards. Smokers freely wandered around with no attempt by staff to restrict smoking to the designated areas. We had a good meal with excellent service in the Yacht Club and had saved the California Grill in our hotel for the last night, Thursday. What a mistake! The service was grim from the start.The prawns ordered by my friend smelt strange. In short both my friend ran from the table some minutes later to be sick in her room and I, having tried half a prawn, woke up ill at 3.45 next morning and still feel sick today (Monday). However what shocked me was the waiter's behaviour. He was annoyed that we dare complain and didn't want to order pudding. He avoided our table and was exceptionally off hand with us.Then, when you just wouldn't expect it to get any worse, we were unable to leave on time in the morning because there was nobody on any of the ground floor reception, bagage or concierge desks, although I had been able to speak to someone on the phone from the room. I found a porter down a corridor who immediately ran to find someone for us. By then there were 16 people in a queue for non existant service. Significantly, although a bell no doubt exists, it had been removed from sight. This won't put me off Disneyland or Disneyworld but the French cause is lost. Please, please Disney   reinstate Disney standards!!",Disneyland_Paris
118594172,5,2011-8,United States,"I know this park since I was born. I have been there 4O times, and I alwayd love it.The site is so magical, the environnement of princess, adventure, space conquest lead you in an other world. You will travel in a dream.Attractions are for all your family, there is for babies, youg children and adults as space Mountain and Indiana Jones. And adults also love quiet attraction as Pirates of Carribeans. Moreover there is many shows as a driving show in Disney Studios. Many many restaurants are disponible. You can hacve a quick lunch or tast french cook in a more luxury restaurant as Blue Lagoon or The Walt's wich is more with an english style and a french cook.For some years, a new park is open. This is Disney Studio. This new park will make you discover the cinema world. Special effects, music, shows... And the Hollywood Tower is the new hard attraction : ) EnjoyTo conclude, Disneyland Paris makes part of Paris monument. If you travel to Paris, enjoy its magical world and make your children dream for some hours.Something more: if you really want to do everything and see the two parks, you will need two days. They sell tickets for 1day 2parks but it is impossible to see the two parks in one day. If you only have 1 day, go in the old park, not in studio. If you have 2 days, enjoy the two parks.There is many hotel all around the park. They are so nice but a little expensive. From 100 to 600     night.",Disneyland_Paris
118559565,5,2011-9,United Kingdom,"We visited Disneyland Paris for my 21st birthday and it was truly magical!The moment we walked through the gates i was flooded with happy birthday wishes and was even given a special disney birthday badge to wear for special treatment.Throughout the day i got vip treatment, i got brought to the front of queues, had a special phone call from Mickey Mouse himself to wish me happy birthday, cast members sang to me and characters all made a recognition!Whilst the park was very busy from opening to closing it didn't feel packed and all the people around make the atmosphere amazing! the whole place was buzzing with excitement.The wait times for rides was nowhere near as bad as i'd imagined. The food was great (a little over priced but thats to be expected). There was plenty of shops on Main Street USA to break up the hectic rush of the rides a little. The parades were all fantastic and both very different, and the fireworks an amazing way to end the day!My only advice is to take things slowly. The park has SOOOO much to do! and although its tempting to rush around and to try and do everything at once, its not the best idea if you want to last until 11.00pm to see the fireworks!i had an unforgettable birthday and i can't wait to visit again!",Disneyland_Paris
118559354,2,2011-9,United Kingdom,"We visited the parc with our friends and their two children aged 7 and 5, the children were really looking forward to the visit as were we.Areas that were poor in my opinion:At least one major ride in every land was shut or cordened off.The staff were decorating & painting many parts of the part while it was open, it was a bit like a building site in many places.We only saw two disney characters in the entire parc in an 8 hour period and the queues for the children to have a photo with them were large, the children were very disappointed about this, if the characters aren't there what distinguishes this from any other amusement park??? Nor is this as per the adverts that Disney put out on the tv.The games arcade near the StarTours ride was unstaffed and out of the 10 Euros we put into the machines (which are 1 Euro a game) we got 3 games. The machines ate the rest and there was no one to go to complain. Suggest you avoid these machines.Many of the food stalls were shut in each of the lands, again this gave the parc the general feel of being only half open and left us with the option of taking the children to restaurants, which cost more.You need to pay attention not just to the parc opening hours but the ride opening hours as many of the rides shut an hour before the parc does so you end up with very disappointed children when they find out the rides are already shut.Be careful when getting onto the rides, one of the Disney staff pulled down the bar on the Pinocchio ride straight onto my knee as he couldn't be bothered to check that I was properly in the ride, when I shouted in pain he just ignored me and moved the car along.To sum up, the children were overall happy enough, but we could have taken them to any theme park for that, we were expecting more from Disneyland. For the price and service (or lack of) I would say don't bother, as clearly if you visit off peak season Disney can't be bothered either.",Disneyland_Paris
118557761,4,2011-2,United Kingdom,"We visited Disneyland Paris is February of this year and although it is excellent for the kids, the selection of restaurants and fast food is very limited and expensive.

You can eat much cheaper off resort and not go to bed hungry and take a good book or games to play as the tv in the rooms only show kids channels or french tv. Despite this though it is a must for families with young children and need not be an expensive trip if you choose to go off peak and go using the self drive option via eurotunnel or the ferry.",Disneyland_Paris
118479110,4,2011-9,United Kingdom,"This was my ninth trip to Disneyland Paris and I can tell you it's nothing like it used to be. I've always said the thing that makes Disney different from the rest is the friendly staff (cast members) who really get into their roles and act the part at the attractions, but this visit I don't think I saw a single cast member smile or make polite conversation   they all seemed so miserable. I was looking forward to Captain EO but it was closed for unscheduled refurbishment. Phantom Manor, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and Cinemagique were also closed. The sound system wasn't working on Rock n Roller Coaster and Crush's Coaster was closed for most of the week as well. Disneyland Paris used to be sparkling clean everywhere   even the toilets   but this is slack as well recently and it is a lot less busy than it used to be. On the upside, this means no queues for rides and attractions and we didn't have to book for dinner anywhere because the restaurants were all empty.The reason I said I'm off to Orlando next time is because we travel from Jersey and since the cancellation of the direct flight from Jersey to CDG airport (a one hour flight), it took us 8 hours to travel to Disneyland Paris...the same amount of time it takes to get to the USA. There is much more to do in the US as well and the cost really isn't that much different.I'd love to give Disneyland Paris 5 stars as it used to be my favourite holiday destination but I really feel the Disney magic has gone. They seriously need to look at their marketing and appeal to different age groups because it's not just for kids   the thrill rides are brilliant. DLRP also needs to sort out some more shows similar to the Lion King, Tarzan and even the Mulan shows they used to have.",Disneyland_Paris
118468396,5,2011-9,South Korea,"We had a great time here. My 6 year old daughter really liked most of the rides. She loved Crush's coaster and Thunder Mountain. The Tower of Terror really scared her though, and she was crying for a little while after. She loved meeting the characters and had a lot of time to spend with them at Inventions buffet in the DL hotel and also at the Cowboy Cookout in Frontierland DLP.",Disneyland_Paris
118461344,2,2011-9,United Kingdom,"Love Disney but we were seriously let down by here.Very long queues, we went early Sept. Smoking everywhere,now I am a smoker and I was even offended at people lighting up beside me at meal times(we were outside but still ). IT IS EXPENSIVE,even if your kids stay and play for free,they need food and drink through the day unless you plan on starving them,the shops merchandise is over priced and its the same stuff in each shop,there were no where near enough characters in the parks.The toilets stank,not what I ever expected in a Disney park. Disneyland Paris workers need to take a few Disney courses,learn how to smile,make you feel wanted. We were only there 3 days and we managed to have a laugh at it all but I wouldnt recommend staying any longer than that.Cant wait to go back to Orlando,thats where the magic really is.",Disneyland_Paris
118459970,5,2010-10,United States,"Adults and Children alike will adore this, Children will relate to the old and new characters and will enjoy the rides (perhaps some lighter ones for the little ones) shows and activites. Adults will enjoy bringing back a little bit of their childhood and thrillseekers will love the adrenalin rush that some of the fantastic rides will give you..Recommended Rides and ShowsTower of Terror (Guranteed to put you of lifts forever hahaha)The Aerosmith Rollarcoaster (So fun)Space Mountain (You'll be shook all over the place)The Car stunt show (Very thrilling)The Ice show (just a little bit cute and magical)Its so lovely to witness the magic that makes children and peter pan type adults smiles, seeing the Disney castle is likely to take your breath away and coming face to face with characters that we've known and loved since our childhood will just bewilder you. This really isnt just the place for children , there really is something magical about Disneyland and the magic never leaves you , once youve been it stays with you forever. Yes its expensive and the food is pretty hideous but its a great trip for a couple of days. Despite being noisey and full of children its actually a pretty romantic place. The buildings at Disney are also rather beautiful, theres a distinct American feel , like an elegant old fashioned frontier town its rather fascinating to see your dreams and childhood and all those films you loved come to life. A MUST DO",Disneyland_Paris
118438097,1,2011-3,United Kingdom,"I first went to  disney Land in Floriday 20 years ago and at that time it seem dated and poor versus the other parks in Floriday. 21 years later it's exactly the same and now seems very dated with a large number of terrible rides that people are willing to queue for over an hour for what they can get at their local fairground. Basically, one big rip off with very few Mickey's and Minnies walking round for autographs and as per most things Parisian expensive and terrible service.",Disneyland_Paris
118436910,3,2011-5,Australia,"Unfortunately friends had gone just before us and given it the thumbs up! Our just 12 yr old son felt like it was an opportunity he might regret if we didn't go. So we went with another son 13 and we were all bored. There were not that many rides that were age appropriate and Thunder Mt was closed! If your kids are into all the characters, merchanise and expensive food you will have a great time. Having been to the LA one as an adult this Paris version failed by comparison. It was an expensive day out for us as we didn't do many rides and found it difficult finding interesting things for the boys to see and react to. I think it would be perfect for young children 3 9yrs old and a whole day would work out cost effective for them.",Disneyland_Paris
118416380,5,2011-9,Ireland,"Where do I start? My first visit to Disneyland and I loved it. I can't compare to America, nor would I want to. This place is magical. Started off with Big Thunder Mountain, stand to right of rope, she opens from there. Don't queue, just try to get as near to rope as possible. Queuing doesn't always work in Disneyland. Great ride. Phantom Manor is brilliant, may scare little ones though. The Disney railroad is a great way to take a load off your feet during the day, however some people don't get off after it going once around the park, so you may be waiting. Indiana Jones is a popular ride, Pirates of the Caribbean is a great one too. Sleeping Beauty castle is great, smaller than I thought. We got to sit in the front for Peter Pan's Flight (using a fastpass), it was brilliant, the best seat for that ride because it is like you are flying!! Alice's Curious Labyrinth was really good, going round and round the maze until you reach the queen of hearts castle. You can take a picture outside sitting under the mad hatter's hat!! The teacups are so much fun, goes by too quick though. Space Mountain is frightening but so worth doing!! Star Tours is fun, Buzz Lightyear is a good one too, although it broke down on us twice, but we got more points haha :) Videopolis is good, nice to sit down. Time flew by, so make sure to have a sort of plan before going. Once upon a dream parade was great, people start queuing to watch half hour before. Disneyland's website will let you see maps of the parks and they upload the programme every week, so check that out for times. Mickey's Magical Celebration ends the day, try to stand facing away from main street as they don't really walk around the full stage. Also, the Thunder Mesa Boat Ride is worth doing, you can also feed the ducks. We went to Disney Village across the road to eat, as restaurants are expensive. There are many packages available including disney hotels, we went to Hotel Cheyenne for a drink, and it seems nice and even has a cowboy and western smell. The disney hotels have security and barriers. We stayed in Radisson Golf Resort, it is just as close as the others, well Disneyland Hotel itself being on the property of the parks. The metro practically brings you to the gates of disneyland too.. If you can avoid weekends do, as we saw the crowd Saturday morning and I could feel the stress. We hardly queued Thursday and Friday!! Buffalo Bill's Evening Show is good too. The Disney Village is great. Also, park in the Disney Village carpark, it is maximum    8 per day and 24hrs. You can bring your own food and water, you can top up your water bottles at the numerous water fountains. It is definitely worth a visit :)",Disneyland_Paris
118400244,3,2011-6,United Kingdom,"On our recent trip to Disneyland Paris we were looking forward to see our grandchild enjoy lots of rides.How wrong could we be and disapointed to find every day we went into the park a ride was broken down causeing large queues..we were expecting to wait for a ride but not for a repair man to come and fix it, not only that a whole section was closed off.Some of the staff were helpfull but otheres were to busy talking to each other and not giving out information to waiting public.I think a trip to Disney USA would teach them how to deal with people.Last on the list is the price of food inside the park.. way over the top..my tip is take snacks with you or you will be spending lots on food..",Disneyland_Paris
118384916,3,2011-9,United States,"I have been visiting Disneylands for over 50 years    yes, my first visit was in 1959! I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly in all the Disney parks. My first visit to Euro Disney was the first year it opened and now this year I decided to visit again to see how it has  aged . Well, it's tired, with faded paint on the buildings, and dirty, boring restaurants. The smoking is simply unacceptable    the staff does nothing to stop it. And weeds    yes, weeds growing so big throughout the storeybook landscaping that a huge dandelion obscured one of the tiny cottages. I was so annoyed by that weed that I wanted to lean out of the little boat and yank it out! All these detractions are exactly what Walt Disney hated in amusement parks. He would be so upset had he visited Euro Disney this September and seen how shabby this park looked. Disneyland used to look fantastic    visiting would transport you to a wonderful place    not in Euro Disney    it's just OK. Well, with that said, if you do plan to go and you are a senior citizen ask for a discount when you purchase your ticket. We purchased the one day, one park ticket and the first amount quoted was 57 Euros. I simply said to the clerk,  Can you give us any discounts?  The clerk looked at our ID then charged us 48 Euros each.",Disneyland_Paris

118365532,3,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Enjoyed our recent trip but can't help feeling a little bit let down. The rides that we went on were good...big thunder mountain is a must! I wanted to be wowed and I wasn't. The characters all had  minders  who appeared to be keeping the English children away and speaking in French to everyone else. Waiting with young children to see the firework display which was supposed to happen at 10.25pm but which actually happened at 11pm, after a full day in the parks, this isn't really what you need. And the toilets were filthy!Overall, I'm glad we went, the children enjoyed it, but we wont be rushing back!",Disneyland_Paris
118360982,3,2011-9,United Arab Emirates,"This review is from the point of view of service, for those who may be thinking of taking the kids there but would rather go First Class. Well I tried and it is almost impossible. If it exists, it is a well kept secret but we went for the top suite which was supposed to give us VIP fast passes and avoid baking in the sun for 90 mins. Well, that only works in 25% of attractions so baking in the sun is not optional, it is an obligation. The food outlets are very average andif you want real food you have to go to the overpriced restaurants that can't be bothered at trying to serve you properly since they know they will never see you again. There should be an option for people looking to enjoy the park and still have more services and comfort. Go with very low expectations and a roughing it mood to survive the experience.",Disneyland_Paris
118358945,5,2011-8,United Kingdom,"We stayed for a weekend in Newport Bay club, was few minutes walk to Disney village and 10 mins to Walt Disney studio and the Disney park.Plenty to see and do, great choice of places to eat to suit all budgets. Plenty of opportunities to have pictures taken with the characters around the hotel and parks. Would recommend booking to go to the character tea, we had 2 hours of greeting different characters, photo opportunities and plenty of food and drink all included. Definitely will go back again.",Disneyland_Paris
118356597,4,2010-12,United States,Visited the park on the 29th december as part as my little girls christmas present. We arrived way before the park and managed to get into the park quite fast. When you visit its best to plan your day first using the maps so you dont waste any time we decided to go onto the disney studios first and as it was till early and quiet we managed to get on a few rides n the kids area still had to queue for aout 15 minutes though and that was when it was quiet. We watched the car show in the big areana which was fantastic but get there early to save the queues and to get a good seat. When we come out of there we were amazed at how packed the park was we went to go on some rides and the wait times were 90 minutes plus which was crazy. So we decided to go onto the other park which was just as bad as we could'nt get on any rides the main street was heaving with people. The best part about it was how christmassy the setting was it was beautiful. We watched a few of the shows which were good the parts we did see in between trying to dodge peoples heads. As we did'nt want to wait for the rides we had a walk round sleeping beautys castle which was beautiful. For dinner we decided to use mcdonalds on disney village the queues were horrendous think it took around 45 minutes to get served i think we paid around 18 euros for 3 meals which i did'nt think was bad being on a disney park. Not many space to sit down to eat had to wait for a table. There is plenty of places to eat all over the parks. There are some lovely shops too so be prepared to spend lots of money cause there is some beautiful gifts and always good to buy a pen and autograph book for when you see mickey or minnie. We bought a little minnie mouse playset in a bag and was about 16 euros. Some may think its expensive on the parks we did'nt think it was overly expensive as we expected it cause as with all attractions whether its in england or another country its always going to be abit more highly priced thats how they make there money as they know people will spend when their there.After dinner we decided to just walk round and look at all the scenery etc we was'nt going to attempt to go on any rides by around 2pm my little girl had only been on 2 rides and she was starting to get upset. We managed to get to see the parade which is amazing out of this world and got to see santa and his reindeers.So we wee happy we saw that after the parade finished many of the people were starting to go home and as we were on the park till 10 pm it gave us chance to run round the park and jump on the rides so we managed to get on alot of them as we could just get straight on. The small world ride is a must its a boat ride and its all dolls based in scenes in different countries it was fantastic how much work had gone into into it. The peter pan flight is also a good one and buzz's flight. We had an evening meal in pinochios restaurant which was lovely too cant remember how much that was think it was about 25 euros which was'nt bad either. By the time 10pm come we were all knackered and had banging headaches could'nt wait to get back to hotel. We would go again but it would have to be when all the kids were at school so we could enjoy the park being christmas and how busy it was you cant enjoy it as much it just seems so stressful. The good thing about going christmas is how christmassy it feels there the shops and main street are all set out beautifully oh and the castle at night is absolutley stunning with all the twinkly christmas lights and tinkerbell blowing here magic sparkle dust out from the top of it it truly is a magical christmas here but way to busy.,Disneyland_Paris
118355763,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Myself, my partner and our 6 year old son went for 3 days in August and we loved the place. Although not as good as the Studio Park, this one still had plenty of great attractions to keep us occupied. We stayed in Santa Fe so had the benefit of 2 extra hours in the park and made the most of this by going on the fantastic Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast and getting in the queue early for Star Tours. Parades happen throughout the afternoon finished off by the spectacular Fantalousion Parade after dark. So many different rides and shops keep this park enjoyable for children of any age!! As i said in the title, we have already booked again for next year, cant wait!!",Disneyland_Paris
118324773,4,2011-8,Cyprus,"Disneyland was somewhere i had never been but always wanted to do when i was a child, however due to a lack of funds, Disney in America at the time and coming from a single parent family, it was a dream only.This August 2011 and almost 30 years later i decided to take my family of 5, my wife and i and 3 children 17, 13 and 7.I could sit her all day telling you it was for the children but honestly it was me that wanted to go and the kids where over the moon.Trying to find a hotel for 2 adults and three older children is impossible unless you buy 2 rooms and if that's one of the big Disney hotels then prepare for a second mortgage.After tinkering between 2 hotels we decided on staying at the Val de europe hotel Elysee opposite the Val de Europe Mall.I will reserve my review for this Hotel on a different day and stick only with The Disneyland park.I bought tickets on Line through our hotel and to be honest it was much easier that way and they where waiting for me when i arrived. 4 days for the price of 3.Day 1 was perfect for us as we arrived the previous afternoon and started our trip the next day giving us a full 4 days and on the afternoon of the 5th day we would fly out from Paris.Some people say you only need 2 3 days but with different children of different ages i knew we could go and please at any time and not miss a thing.We got the hopper tickets to both parks so it was total freedom.We had already stopped in Paris for 3 days so we where used to walking alot, but wow you really need some good shoes and forget the fashion statement, just take care of those little piggies otherwise they will be running all the way home in 2 days and needing surgery.I chose the Elysee Hotel because they had the 2 hours before the park opens tickets, just like the Hotels just outside the park, which i thought would let us gain an advantage and it did, you get to go on the good rides with only 10 minutes waiting, sorted!!!!I must admit i was a little let down as my dream didn't match actually what i was doing and witnessing, but the look on my little sons face was worth all the money in the world.Ok down to the real Disney, first the rides are fantastic, nothing really scary and mostly for all young children under 13, so 2 of my children where happy, the 17 year old even though he liked the whole experience was mainly texting friends on his mobile, i guess thats the age.Use the fastpass option on your tickets, you can then go to the rides at a time allocated for you, usually 1 and a half hours later but you will notice that you are only queuing for 20 minutes and you can spend your time looking at other things in the parks.Food is fats food and nothing really good but your not expecting anything else are you.All fastfood outlets are sold as a 3 course meal, so if you want to eat per person you will be minimum 13 euros if i remember right and thats sort of Hamburger and chips and a drink and a small fruit, it gets the job done thats it.There are off course many options for vouchers and better restaurants, but to be honest, do you really want to be inside eating for more than an hour and a half with children who prefer to be outside driving you crazy.Breakfast with characters and afternoon lunch with Disney characters is also a no go for us as they where all over the place anyway and it didn't seem to be worth the extra costs and time, but everyone has their ideas.If you are taking children young and i mean my youngest is 7 then prepare yourself to buy the autograph book and pen and spend most of your time running after the characters and getting them to sign your book and have that all important picture taken.well if i had known this before i would of at least prepared by doing a 2 month navy seal course in armed combat and probably looked up most swear words in many languages.Yes its fun but after the fist day of this you suddenly realize that the pushing in and shouting at other parents is normal and being British doesn't actually cut the mustard.Once you put away your British passport and give that all important look of a crazy parent on holiday stare, you know what, its easy and you start to laugh.I managed to get all the Characters pictures with all my children and they signed his autograph book and that will be something he will treasure for the rest of his life, and without any stress, just my top lip is now stuck like Elvis and i had to light a few candles at my local church as i had been cursing for 3 days straight.I really enjoyed our stay and went every where did all the shows and all the rides, maybe even 2 or 3 times on certain rides, the Hollywood Tower is the best with a close second the Areosmith roller coster.Yes you can do most things in 2 days, being one day at each park but it will kill you and you wont remember anything.Its expensive at the parks as all will tell you, for a good guide i would say that you will need 400 Euros a day with food allday and the ice creams and drinks and dont forget all those key rings and teddies you need, thast for a family of 5, yes you can spend more very easy if you do Character meals or the Wild bills show, but its a guide and not cheaping out.The Disney village which is in between the both parks is where we spent a few nights as it is a little more relaxing and gives you a chance to wind down with a drink or too.Overall will i go back, probably not, yes its fantastic and i would give it a real thumbs up, but i think its a once in a lifetime holiday and really for children, people do come back year after year but how and why i can not tell you.Its a bit like Shrek 3, its a good movie but you know all the characters and the story and apart from a different song somewhere in the middle its a little tedious.Dont miss this holday if you get the chance and take every thing in your stride.I have over 400 pictures and memories that will last..I will try and give a better post on my next try, but for now thats it",Disneyland_Paris
118312953,5,2011-9,United Kingdom,"Visited Disneyland Paris for 4 days in September 2011. I absolutely loved it, there was so much to see and do. Rides were great and we were lucky that we visited I guess off peak as there wasnt bad queues and if there was a half hour queue we simply used a Fastpass. The park is clean, constantly seeing people sweep up. There are rides and attractions for all ages and all type of riders. The whole place is completely overpriced, charging    4 for a bottle of coke. We learnt after the 1st day to bring our own drinks in! They say they do not allow picnics in the parks and all bags do get searched upon entry but I saw plenty of people still taking snacks in to keep the cost down. We wanted to buy a couple of souvenier photos from the rides which we did, just be prepared to pay around    15 for one.......",Disneyland_Paris
118280222,3,2011-7,United States,"This is our fourth Disney location, and it was our least favorite.First   dirty. I have never before seen a dirty bathroom as Disney   not in Florida, California or Hong Kong, but the bathrooms at Disney Paris were disgusting.Second   service   CMs did not have that 'go above and beyond' attitude that one is used to encountering at Disney hotels and attractions. Some were good, but others were downright surly. Third   smoking. The park is supposed to be non smoking, but many guests ignore the rule and the CMs do not enforce it at all. In a crowded park even if you are outside, there is just no getting away from the smoke. I felt bad for all the children whose faces were at the same level as other people's cigarettes. Fourth   line etiquette, or rather, lack thereof. When characters appear it is a free for all. People push and shove their children to the front and kids who try to be polite and use manners suffer for it. Maybe at a less crowded time of year a visit would be more tolerable, but even my children said they wish we would have skipped this.",Disneyland_Paris
118241520,5,2011-9,United Kingdom,"Stayed at the Sequoia   excellent hotel and location, very comfortable room (pay the extra   10 for a lake view room recommended) and breakfasts were included and a vast array of food to choose from. Sampled the evening buffet and that was very good too, (remember to book your table every night, you could miss your evening meal, if you opt for half board). Flew with Easy Jet to CDG which was excellent value for money (  26   50 each way) although CDG was a nightmare to navigate through (from 2B to 2E) to reach the Disney VEA bus! DISNEYLAND PARIS IS NOT A RIP OFF. I can't understand those who have stated that it is very expensive (kids under 7 stay & play free!!!!) what planet are you on?...obviously you've never shopped at the UK Disney stores either! We found that eating out in the Disney Village good value (Rainforest Cafe: 21 euros for a 2 course adult meal and 12 euros for a child's 2 course very reasonable) I'd advise to book Mickey's Cafe through the Disney Hotel concierge   better choice of times than the cafe front desk offer you   so the kids can meet all their favourite characters! Disneyland Park and Studios not too busy early September, could walk staight on to Pirates of the Carribbean and Star Wars or just wait 10   20 minutes for the majority of the others. Longest was Crush Coaster though   that was 50 minutes (very popular ride!). Would go back in a minute   much better value for money and have spent less money at Disney than holidaying with HAVEN in the UK!",Disneyland_Paris
118225875,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,this is my third visit to Disneyland Park and the visit was as magical as ever.. the best part is to see the utter joy on childrens faces when they meet their favourite characters.. good variety of rides for all age groups.. only issue can be the queues! be prepared to wait.. and whilst some are def worth the wait (runaway train ) I'm not so sure waiting 75 mins for others is quite so much!the parades are lovely and the catering outlets are plentiful (though food wise its very  fast food   i do wish the french influence was a little more on the catering side !.. service wise is pretty good   though dont expect the american slick and efficient  smiling version !,Disneyland_Paris
118211688,3,2011-9,Netherlands,"We arrived early and had plenty of space to park our car. Although it was somewhat difficult to find since the signs weren't always clear. Parking the car for the day costs E15,  which you can pay by cash (although this isn't shown on any of the signs, they only say creditcards, which made my boyfriend panic a bit since we don't own a creditcard, lol).It was quite a long walk to the entrance, although there were those flat escalator belts, you still need to walk a while before you're there. But that's nothing new for a theme park and was to be expected. Just make sure that any old people or small children can do that kind of walk before you get to the rental wheelchairs and strollers.We already had our tickets, so you just stick them into a machine (any which way, it works, doesn't matter how you stick it in) and walk right through. Your ticket works all day (or more if you have multiple days on it), so if you want to visit the Disney Studios, don't be afraid to exit and go back at any time. You walk past the studio's before you get to the entrance of Disneyland from the parking lot, you can't miss it.Maps are free and available in multiple languages, you can get them after you've passed the entrance, they're in display cases along the sides.We didn't have to wait very long anywhere, however if the wait was long, we used the fast pass.How the fast pass works:Near the  adventure  as Disney calls them, there are signs that say  fast pass . There are machines were you swipe your entrance ticket and the machine then spits out a new ticket. This ticket shows the timeframe in which you need to be back at the adventure. In the meantime you can go and do something else than standing in line. When you go back, you enter through the special fast pass entrance (big signs, can't miss them) and hand the ticket with the timeframe to a employee. We never had to wait more than five minutes using a fast pass ticket. And got to do lot's of things in between. However, you can only get one fast pass ticket at a time. So you can't swipe your entrance ticket at multiple places at the same time, unless you have some kind of special ticket for which you pay extra.The best Disneyland toys stuff clothes can be bought right at the beginning in a long street. Almost everything you see in other shops stands in the park can also be bought here. These shops in the beginning do tend to get really crowded and badly ventilated though (read: very warm and damp).The food was expensive and tasted quite bad, but what else is new in themeparks. We payed E9.  for a menu of medium french fries, medium softdrink and a chickenburger. Apparently it's really weird that some people (my boyfriend) doesn't like cheese and doesn't want cheese on their chickenburger, since the staff at the restaurant couldn't stop laughing and making strange faces when we asked for it. I understand French, which they didn't know, so I know they were laughing about that and not something else.Most of the staff were nice and happy, but ofcourse some were quite nasty. Can't be helped in such a big themepark. But geez, I just asked someone at a popcorn stand where the nearest bathroom was and he didn't even speak to me, he just pointed somewhere in the distance...Then the rides: most rides are for the little kids. Which is fine. The rollercoasters are fun but nothing special. Although the Aerosmith one in the Disney Studio's was really cool and something else, but more about that one in a minute, because...All is not so well with the rides here, and that's where we got really, really annoyed.First, we went on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. It's your standard sit in a boat and look at the puppets ride. After you get in the boat, the first thing you pass is a restaurant (yes, I kid you not, a restaurant with people eating and stuff). I just had time to make the joke that  wow, they make really good looking puppets here!  when the ride got stuck, and so did we and about 50 other people across several different boats. Not the end of the world, these things happen. But dear lord... Before they found out we were stuck, took about 10 minutes. Then they tried resetting the ride for another 10 minutes, which didn't work. After which they decided to get us out. Which was easier said than done. Since we were in boats, in the water and the restaurant was quite a swim away and we weren't prepared to go swimming. Raising a special boardwalk didn't take very much time, but then they spend what seemed like ages discussing how to get us from the boat onto the boardwalk which shouldn't have taken that long, we could just get out and get across, but the staff wouldn't let us. The boat before us was allowed to get off, which was scary with an elderly lady that had to climb over several benches when she had difficulty walking (she had a walking stick) and some handicapped children. Then it was our turn, or so we thought. We could push our boat to the boardwalk without much difficulty, but again, the staff yelled we weren't allowed to do that. After 45 minutes and multiple people getting angry and frustrated, my boyfriend and I ran out of patience and just pushed the boat to the boardwalk. Some staffmember ran into to the water wearing a fisherman's suit and cursed at us in French, telling us to stop. But we had had enough and pushed the boat (and her along side it trying to push back) to the boardwalk and got off, after which all the other people on our boat followed and the staff helped them off. We then got a ticket with which we could return later and go on the ride but by that time, the damage had been done and we were just happy to be outside in the fresh air and daylight again.This wasn't the only time a ride broke down on us. We also went on the Aerosmith ride in de studio's and just before we were to enter..... it broke down and we had to wait another 20 minutes looking at empty trains leaving and entering the station. Luckily for us, this time we weren't actually on the ride when it broke down. But we did start to wonder what kind of state these rides are in....If you want to take pictures of you or your child with a Disney character, there are lines that you have to stand in to wait in order to get your picture taken. The characters don't walk through the park freely. They just stand in a designated place. However, in the studio's we did find characters walking about and no lines to take pictures.Overall, we had a good time, but in retrospect, as two adults, we wouldn't have gone through the trouble of getting all the way to France from Holland had we known that it wasn't anything special compared to other themeparks in our own country. It certainly doesn't compare in any way to the Efteling.Do's:  Go to the Disney Studio's; there are fun rides and shows  Take the Toy Story 2 ride near Space Mountain, it's tons of fun, especially for small children (to you right from the entrance)  Take a map with you at the beginning of the park  Use fast pass when lines are long  Take your own food and drinks with you. Everything is expensive and doesn't taste that great  Make sure older people and small children can walk a distance towards the rental area for wheelchairs and strollers from the parkinglot  Be prepared for rides to break down Dont's:  Expect it to be anything special in terms of themeparks in general if you're with adults only  Go on the steamboat, it's rather boring",Disneyland_Paris

118159496,2,2011-9,India,"Had heard a lot about this place and unfortunately did not read reviews about this place on trip advisor and my travel agent Kuoni travels claimed that this attraction is worth going to. For travellers from India, if one has been to Wonderla at the outskirts in Bangalore Disneyland is not even 10% of what Wonderla has to offer. Disneyland Paris has very limited rides and the waiting time for most of the rides is 40 60 mins. The rides are all of the same nature, the park is divided into two Parks and I must say both Parks are just a way to earn money. I would rather have spent a day in Paris and spent time in visiting the beautiful museums rather than wasting time at the parks which have nothing much to offer. Travel from Paris to Disneyland and back in a cab is about 200 euros. This is complete waste of time, energy and money and I would advice fellow travellers to carefully plan the visit before going to the parks.",Disneyland_Paris
118122502,3,2011-9,United States,"When I told friends and family that we were going to DLP, they all raised their eyebrows and said  oooh, you wont like that . The reason for their response, I think is that we've spent 7 weeks in Disney USA over the past 5 years ... and they are right   it does not compare.However, we tried to go and not compare the two places, but it hard to do that. Particularly, when Magic Kingdom looks and is set out all but the same and both Florida and Anahiem. A few noticable differences on the  developmental side  ... DLP claims to be a no smoking park, however, this could not be further from the truth. Europeans are not yet adjusted to be told when and where to smoke   and the staff are definately not ready to tell the visitors not to light up in the middle of Fantasy Land!! I lost count of the amount of times I had to move my 2 year year olds face out of the way of a lit cigerette! I personally think because of the number of visitors smoking in the park is dangerous.The other difference is that the French are not as customer orientated as the Americans, and this is a noticeable difference. The Americans smile all day regardless of the number of times they are asked the same question, however, this is definately not the case in France. Be prepared for this!!The cleaniless of the park is not up to much either, with the toilets by mid day in all areas of the park were disgusting! Cigerette ends were all over the park too   and these were clearly from days before! It begs the question  how often is the park fully cleaned? However, there were some highlights ... Pirates of the Caribbean is better than LA and Florida, Mission Space is one of the better ones and we all enjoyed the Thunder Mountain. The Toy Story part to Walt Disney Studio's is really good too for the youngstersQueing doesn't really work in DLP either, for rides or food! Everyone tried to cut in ... The Purchase of food throughout the Park is unorganised and takes a long time to get food! The portion sizes are also say half what you would get in America with the cost being approximately the same.I would say that the merchandise throughout the park is different and there are lots of things available here that are not available in other parks, which is a positive. The prices appear to me to be on par with other Disney Parks.We were in the parks for 4.5 days, and I would say you only need 3 days in the parks to completely do everything. Having said all this, if you have never visited a Disney Park before, DLP will make your year!! Overall some magical memories, but we would look to go back to America next year if we got the chance!",Disneyland_Paris

One yr old was able to come on everything with us which is really lovely. VERY clean, did not see any rubbish.

118105045,4,2011-9,United Kingdom,"We booked a 5 night package that included hotel, Eurostar, park tickets and express luggage. Disneyland Paris is not as good as Florida or LA as it is not as clean (especially the toilets) or as organised, but is still a good park and we enjoyed it. With the exception of a couple of rude staff the majority of staff members were polite and friendly and a lot spoke English.What stopped this park being as excellent as the American parks for me is the smoking all around the park. As it was busy we could not move more than a couple a feet without coming across someone with a lit cigarette in hand that is swinging at there side as they walk around before throwing the butt on the ground, this is the height of a child head and is not only unpleasant but dangerous and could easy catch a child face. Although Disney do ask on the park guides for people to only smoke in designated areas it is completely ignored and not enforced by Disney staff. I am a big fan of Disney and feel that this should not be tolerated in a theme park with children around.Eurostar from Ebbsfleet     We have never used Eurostar before and I have to say it was great. We booked from Ebbsfleet due to the fact that it would be easier to park and pre booked parking on the Ebbsfleet station site (were unable to book on the eurostar site)? We arrived at car park B, there were lots of empty spaces and the barrier lifted with a welcome Mr      . (No ticket was issued). The station was right next to the parking and you just go in the main building with eurostar entrance just inside with hardly any queue to go through the baggage and customs check. The tickets are marked with your coach number... (es voiture) and seat number...(place assise) and the waiting area is modern with a small shop inside. On arrival at Disney station if you have express luggage you just go up 2 escalators to the top floor of the station and hand over your bags before going into the park a few steps from the station doors. We stayed in the park for a couple of hours then went to check into our hotel reception around 5.00pm which was quiet and collected our luggage. On check out day we handed our bags in at the luggage room (they tear off a ticket from the labels for collection) and went into the park for the rest of the day. We later collected our luggage at the same place it was dropped off on arrival around 75 mins prior to departure. The eurostar check in is also next to the luggage counter and you go straight onto the train. UK emigration checks your passports on the train as well. On arrival back at Ebbsfleet we were off the train through the station and out the car park (the barrier just lifted automatically as we had pre paid) in 5 mins. Great!",Disneyland_Paris
118084457,5,2011-9,Greece,"Just returned from Disneyland after a short family trip and my mind is still there! Whatever your age, you become a kid! Liked all the rides and parades but hated the pushing and shoving and queuing up for about 60 minutes in order to have a 3 minutes train ride.. In order to see it all you need 2 3 days, avoid the weekend when the park is packed with visitors and you can't even walk..The kids loved it! Hadn't seen something like that before... Tip! Make the maximum of fastpasses, you really pass fast! Can't wait to go there again!",Disneyland_Paris
118082642,4,2011-8,Canada,"We visited in mid August 2011 with husband and 9 year old son. We were staying in the 9th district and walked to the Auber metro stop. From there, it is a direct metro ride to the very last stop, Marne la Vallee which is the Disneyland stop. It's literally 35 minutes from downtown Paris. Don't waste your money on a shuttle from your hotel. It really is extremely easy to get there on your own!Once you step out, voila, there you are. Both the Disneyland Park and MGM Studios and their Downtown Disney (with shops and restaurants) are all side by side. In other words, totally walkable. If you have been to the Florida Disney, you know how far apart the parks are and you know you need to take a bus monorail ride between parks. Not the case here. Everything is much more compact, so we had one day and did both Disneyland and MGM very easily.Definite plus is the size   compressed down from the massive U.S. parks. There are no Animal Kingdom or Epcot parks. There is the light parade and fireworks in Magic Kingdom. Some rides are different in both parks and overall the lines are not as long as in the U.S. Expect the same type of prices, but in Euro.We had a fun time here. It was our last day in Paris and we decided we would give our son a day that didn't include museums or historial sites!",Disneyland_Paris
118054679,4,2011-9,United Kingdom,"After visiting Disney in Orlando and L.A. There is just something about Paris that doesn't have that magic. The staff were not as friendly and didn't smile half as much as the American staff. We found the Parks not as clean and tidy as the US. If you are a non smoker then you could have problems even though smoking areas are provided people just walk round smoking,even in the queues for the rides ,we reported this to staff and they weren't interested.The whole of the park is littered with cigarette ends and no one seems to clean them up. There is no other description for the public toilets in the Parks but they STINK. This was my fourth trip to Disneyland Paris and every time I say Never Again.",Disneyland_Paris
118047460,4,2011-8,Netherlands,"We went to Disneyland Paris in August, Saturday the 19th. It was busy as it was still in summer school holiday. As we were with one on the wheelchair, so sometimes we could pass the long queu and got the priority access (as shown in the special card we asked in the reception information). One thing we missed in this park, we hardly saw Disney characters mingle with visitors. Children were dying to see them as when I was in Disney Orlando, we saw some characters walking around. Too bad... Maybe it was too hot for them to in the costume?Food and drink are in regular price, so do not to worry about expensive food and drink. You can choose depend on the budget. Do not bring too much food and drink inside the park as you have to pass the guard who check your belongings. So, don't think that you can picnic in the park.Firework show was the climac of the day! It was amazing!!!!! Love it. If you go to Disneyland for the 1st time, don't miss fireworks!!!!! Really worth to see, as well the Illumination parade before the fireworks. Georgous!!!!!I would love to come back again in the calmer period.",Disneyland_Paris
118026195,2,2011-7,United Kingdom,"Maybe The bar was set too high by Orlando, but this place is the pits in my opinion. We surprised our children with a trip to EuroDisney this past summer while wer were staying in London. Our kids have never been to Disney anywhere and so they were really thrilled to be there. I think that because of cultural differences, EuroDisney was a major dissapointment. It seemed like EVERYONE smoked cigarettes EVERYWHERE, We would be standing in a line and someone would light up right in our faces. The lines were just way too long for everything and people just pushed their way through the lines. They do have a sort of  fast pass  where you reserve your time to queue for the rides, but even when you arrive at your time, that just gets you in to wait for antoher line. Food options were not very good at all. We ate at the  American Diner  which was absolutely filthy dirty. Disabled tourists, be warned, you must have note from your doctor in order to get a disabled visitor pass. You would think that they would take my word with my swollen (just operated on) knee and walking stick. Overall, I would say save the money and spend your Euros elsewhere. It was ridiculously expensive and just not worth it. Go to Orlando or California instead.",Disneyland_Paris
118000710,5,2011-4,United Kingdom,"Get there early and try to do rides that you like early, use queue jumper reservation tickets where possible.  For eats   try Rainforest restaurant just outside park which is best that we found for value and quality.",Disneyland_Paris
117966404,3,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Stayed on resort at Hotel Newport Bay, second visit, the first time was in 2001 and although the reception , bar area etc looks ok our hotel room was tired from 10 years of use, our 6th floor room with balcony opened onto the front of the hotel and between the constant arrival and departure of buses and noise from some form of large extraction unit below our room, it was not possible to leave the balcony doors open, which combined with a broken air conditioning unit in the room, made for some uncomfortable sleeping conditions.( The air con was fixed once reported ) The room was supplied with a coffee machine but 6 euros for 3 sachets meant it was unused for the duration of our stay, as was the contents of the mini bar ( 3 euros for a Mars Bar!! ) we upgraded to the Admiral floor when booking and when we picked up our complimentary tea and coffee we were given enough for 2 cups, when questioned we were informed that this was for 2 people for the week!! Luckily we had taken coffee sachets with us and this helped a lot.The hotel as expected at this time was extremely busy and this resulted in long queues for breakfast and a general scrum for the continental style food, however the food was fine and the rolls,ham and cheese came in handy as snacks in the parks later.Thankfully my children were old enough to give the characters a miss this time but many a parent stood patiently in long long queues in the hotel foyer for the obligatory autograph. The walk to the park around Disney lake is still enjoyable but watch out for the pot holes and worn paths, particulary at night, easy to twist an ankle, I dont reacll those 10 years ago! We noticed a light fitting that had come loose from the side wall of the bridge as we walked in the morning and it was still there that night! The parks are what the parks are and yes we expected them to be busy at this time of year, but wow there,s busy and there,s busy, huge queues to enter the parks, for rides, for food,toilets even ( women using the gents due to the length of the queue!) and finally at the end of a long day even queues to leave the parks. The fast pass system was also under pressure with a 20 minute fast pass queue for Big Thunder Mountain on most days and on several occasions we were given fast pass times 5 hours after swiping our tickets.We experienced a number of ride failures with the biggest culprit being Big Thunder Mountain ( 3 times in 1 day ) not funny when you have queued for 70 minutes with two fed up teenagers breathing in cigarette smoke from people on both sides of a winding queuing system, ( Disney needs to extend its non smoking policy to include the rides along with the hotels,restaurants etc.) Space mountain,Phantom Manor, Buzz Lightyear and the Carousel also all had technical difficulties during our stay. The cost of the visit is expensive but Disney seem intent on extracting every last Euro ( 2 Euros for a spin in the train around Disney Lake, the 6 Euros for the Hotel Room Coffee, 12 Euros for a 10 minute trip in the balloon !) but the cost of food in the Disney Village and Parks is generally prohibitive and be prepared to select your dining times with military precision to avoid long delays and more queues, we snacked at lunchtime and then bit the bullet in the evening and ate either in the park or the Village, and comfortably spent on average 140 Euros on feeding a family of four with a drink or two each. This will be our last visit to the attraction ( 3rd time in total ) and unfortunately for us the magic lessens with each visit probably due to the children growing up, familairity etc but unfortunately my overiding memories of our stay this time will be:  An ageing hotel, long long queues, expense and the need for Patience,Patience and more patience!",Disneyland_Paris
117955068,2,2011-8,Ireland,"Let me start by saying that I am a seasoned veteran of the Disneyland experience since my first visit to the park in California in 1990 followed by three consecutive visits to Eurodisney in '99,2000 & 2001. This however, was my first visit with two little boys, 7 and 4, and as such the experience was very different but no less magical ! The rides are still fantastic but the reality of hour long queues for nearly everything (and this on the two worst days weather wise of the entire summer!) explain the title of my review above. We bought 2 day 2 park tickets for each of us and spent Friday 26th and Saturday 27th August working our way around Disneyland and the Disney Village. We were experienced enough to fully exploit the Fastpass system by pulling tickets for a busy ride the second we arrived on park but this facility is limited and only available on certain rides. Then we were onto our first attraction and the interminable queues !It is very important to set your expectations for the visit. It is impossible to do everything so do not even try and if you are visiting with small children then you must plan your visit accordingly, so sadly for us adults there was no Indy, no Space Mountain and in the Disney Village we just stared but could not touch most of the great rides on display but that just means more thrills when the boys are older. That said there are still plenty of attractions to amuse families with small children particularly in Fantasyland and with little boys Buzz Lightyear is a must so make sure you pull a Fastpass and come back at your predefined time to go top of the queue.Now for my list of quibbles... On the first day on park I took note of the buffet restaurant near the Aladdin attraction and suggested to Deirdre that we would check it out for dinner on our second night. Unfortunately when we casually walked into the empty foyer of the asian buffet on the Saturday night we were refused entry to the BUFFET because we did not have a reservation.When I asked where I could make a reservation I was told that I could make a reservation for the following night !! at the reservations desk near the entrance to the park. It wasn't just the refusal but the supercilious nature of it after spending    500 on admission tickets that hurt the most. I felt so bad about it that I stopped by the customer care reservations desk on my way out of the park and mentioned to a chap called Michael there that a simple note on the entrance to the buffet restaurant explaining the need for a reservation might have saved my blushes and embarrassment at the hands of the Maitre'D in training who had left such a poor impression on us moments earlier. I was quickly reminded that it was Paris I was and not Disneyland proper when Michael began to defend the indefensible behavior of his colleague and I reminded him that as the customer I was merely suggesting how they might improve their  product offering  by a better communication strategy! Or maybe all I wanted was a  Sorry Sir hope we didn't ruin your evening too much  and then send me on my way with a pat on the head.Good job I didn't mention to Michael that most of the bathroom facilities we had encountered that day were filthy or he may have handed me a bucket and a mop! Oh and one final thing we didn't get a chance to meet Mickey Mouse in person during our visit but the family of very large mice ( the bubonic plague carrying variety!) that crossed our path as we came out of the turnstiles at 21:00 on Saturday 27th August 2011 more than made up for it ... NOT !",Disneyland_Paris

Last time we were threre was 5 years ago and we noticed how tired the place is starting to look. The pricing is the usual moan and i will say that the food and drink is shockingly priced for what you get and the average quality and choice. Typically 7.50e for pint beer, 2.60   3.00e for a small bottle water. We ate once in Planet Hollywood, 72euros for 2 adults and a 2 year old for a main dish and one small cola each and kids menu.( average quality) Almost no avoiding this price range for dinner, you could go a lot higher. Pizza Planet in the park was ok with buffet salad pasta pizza. Take your own tea bags! French and Spanish tourists were both ignorant and rude with no sense of a queue whether for a bus or a photo opportunity.

The problem is the complete lack of organizations, the workers almost always with no smiles and long faces and the loss of quality time that leaves.The qeues are bigger because they are not well organized.

It is definatly a good Disney to go to (oviously not as good as Orlando, but a really fun and exciting one to visit). Alot of people seemed to head to the parks early   around 9.00 and 10.00, but the rides don't even open until 10.00   this is where they ran (yes ran) to the rides to get the the front of the ques   but the best time was around 9.45   10.00. Mainstreet   full of shops and eating places, there were some great shops full of Disney merch (but be warned that not everything will be sold here or in Disney Villiage, so buy when you see, don't wait until you leave), another tip is to use the arcades (situated on both sides) to travel past the crowds on the way in and out.Fantasyland   the busiest of lands, where the majority of younger children were and where the ques seemed to be very long   the most popular was Dumbo, Peter Pan and Snow White etc., waiting upto 60 mins. There is alot to do in this part (including the castle) with a good ice cream parlour (Fantasia ice creams??)   the Mad Hatters Tea Cups are a must do and the Curious Labyrinth was good too.Frontierland   yee hah, get on the runaway train of Big Thunder Mountain (a favourite ride   on which we went on x4 times, would have been 5, but it broke down after a 45min wait)   this que was the worst as when reaching the middle it got very hot and sweaty, when queing in the day use the left hand lane and the right at night, and when riding the middle seemed to have the best experience. I really like the theme of this world with the cowboy themed stores and attractions   the Phantom Manor and Big Thunder are a must do of the trip.Adventureland   Yo Ho Ho a pirates life for me, Pirates of the Caribbean was a personal favourite and is still a fun ride (although it does not have the Jack Sparrow and co. from the Orlando ride   it still is a great ride and has the best drops), the Indiana Jones rollercoaster was really good too, but no longer goes backwards and is over too quick (it should definatly go round twice)   this is a really cool themed world, on par with Frontierland.Discoveryland   Space Mountain: Mission 2 and Star Tours (what else is there to say) these two rides are great, and the ques weren't too long either   Autopia and Buzz Lightyear Laser Shooter (around 90mins waiting time) were longer ques.It is definatly a fun experience, that even the oldest person can have fun. The Fast Pass ride tickets are a definat yes, but not all the time, always check how long the que is as it may not be as long as suggested. Take your own water bottles and fill up at the water fountains situated around the park, and fill up at breakfast or take in snacks (but some were not too expensive). The parades were good (especially the night time one with fireworks) as the other was at a stupid time of 7.15pm. It is definatly worth reading reviews for tips on money saving and your experince as they helped alot.",Disneyland_Paris
117657022,5,2011-9,United Kingdom,"The Disneyland Park won us all over. It was simply brilliant! I went with my husband, and 3 children aged 4, 7 and 8, one who which is disabled.One thing I would recommend is the disney tea party. It was great. The characters interacted with the children briliantly. Minnie even took my little one up to dance which she thought was amazing! We did breakfast at Mickey's cafe in the disney village too, but it didnt really compare. All the characters did was move from table to table posing for a photograph   a little disappointing. But the tea party was great, the high light of our stay. Although I would note that it is sweet food only, much to the children's delight.The fantillusion parade and Fireworks were magical. The best weve ever seen.Our kids loved the flying elephants, it's a small world and the carousel rides, (theyre wimps ;). There's lots of great merchandise to buy although obviously at a price. Brought the girls princess dresses, one of which cost 70 euros! Yes, a bit steep   but it was absolutely beautiful. Much more detailed and better quality than you could buy from shops back home.We were given an easy pass for my child due to her disability, which meant we were able to queue at the exit which was a life saver as she doesn't cope with long queues. Because of the pass we didnt have to wait more than 10 minutes to go on a ride and there was seating in special areas for you to wait at most rides. One of the rides had a queue that was up to a 85 minute wait, so we were really thankful for this pass. You could use the pass on most rides. There was just a handful of rides that it couldn't be used for. You could also use it for the disney character meet and greets and shows. Each ride had a different number of helpers allowed on the ride with the disabled person, ranging from 1 to 7. To get the pass I took my daughters DLA award letter and you need a letter from a health professional saying that the disabled person finds it difficult to stand in a queue for a long period of time. Just go to the city hall on your arrival to show your documents and collect the pass.Anyway, all in all a great park and we will be returning!",Disneyland_Paris
117651661,5,2011-9,United Kingdom,"Even the entrance is beautiful, walking under the Disney hotel, Main street opens up in front of you with Sleeping Beauty's stunning castle in the distance. As we entered the Princesses were meeting children right there in the entrance and within 5 mins of arriving my 7 year old had met Snow White and Sleeping Beauty and the magic had begun.Rides are fab, queues are crazy. Get smart with your FastPass in the morning and you can whizz round the big rides then take it easy in the afternoon and enjoy the themed areas like the caves and the suspension bridge, you can launch children a foot into the air if you jump in the right place.We booked lunch with the Princesses, which is frankly good value for the food alone which is excellent, plus the chance to chat with Cinders, SW, SB and a rather gormless prince. 2 hours of luxury in the midst of the madness.Get your spot by the kerb for the parade at least 30 mins before the start time. There's plenty of gift shops and cafes around Main Street and you'll need a coffee by then. Food choices seem very limited initially, all fast food. But do your homework and you'll find some decent cafes and a few restaurants. You can even get a beer in the Bavarian restaurant next to the Peter Pan ride! you'll thank me for that bit, we only found it on the way out!Overall, as good as you'd hope for Disneyland, if you can put up with fast food and some pretty rude queueing.",Disneyland_Paris
117648122,2,2011-7,France,"We stayed for 4 days and experienced 6 breakdwns of attrations. Unlucky? This is not what I expect from a facility such as this.Staff were helpful but all could not provide adeqaute information Required a complaint to the Management office, be prepared to queue and be 'sorted ' by the door staff!!!!Resulted in free passes and queue beater access",Disneyland_Paris
117641333,5,2010-11,United States,"This is the perfect sized park  straight out of a fairy tale and not so large as to make you feel lost and exhausted. The lines through security move well, and tents are provided in inclement weather  but seeing French soldiers walking through and around the Marne la Vallee train station (which is where the shuttle buses drop guests & the trains arrive from Paris) armed with automatic rifles is not very  Disney like ! Be very careful walking across the tile floors as you enter the park , down where the lockers are located, because they are horribly slippery when it's raining or snowing.We saw the park all decorated for Christmas, with  snow  blowing across Main Street,(competing with the driving rain!), and the decor was elegant and tasteful. Sleeping Beauty's Castle, a lovely gem, pink tinged with blue turrets, lies at the end of the path; you walk up to it and underneath to enter the land of the Magic Kingdom, which features more of the  classic  story based rides, restaurants and shops.Some of these are not found at any other Disney park and others have a twist that makes them just different enough to seem new. No Winnie the Pooh here, but they do have Pinnochio, Snow White and Peter Pan. The feature dining event in this park is Auberge De Cendrillon, opened for lunch and dinner, which provides personal time with the Princesses and their Consorts. Yes, it's very expensive, but it was such an elegant afternoon with good food and great photo opps. We were adults but got just as much time with the Princesses as the little kids did, and it was such fun to hear each one converse and stay in character! There was plenty of room for viewing the parades and the Tree Lighting Ceremony at the front end of Main Street and I found myself crying  happy tears  when I turned and saw the Castle awash in tiny Christmas icy lights! The Main Street Electrical Parade was great despite the constant rain. One thing to note is that if you have any sort of disability make sure that you take a detailed note from your MD asking for exactly the special accommodations that you need. Unlike the US, where you are not required to produce private information that could violate the HIPAA law, France isn't bound by any such restrictions, and you won't get an Assistance Pass without it. Each pass is color coded so that Cast Members know exactly what you need, but give up any thoughts of anyone caring if you are taken care of during Parades or special events. We encountered a guy from  management  who, when asked for assistance, not only didn't care but was outright defiant when asked to hold to the rules! It wasn't just me  we saw a gentleman in a wheelchair, with an Assistance Pass, being turned away from the special seating area, while the  manager  permitted others, with no documentation, access when they smiled at him! This would NEVER happen at any other Disney Park. All in all, I will look forward to returning to Paris and Disneyland Park for day trips and long weekends.",Disneyland_Paris
117627363,3,2011-9,Australia,After a magical thurs and Friday the weekend came.... We had VIP passes as we stayed in castle club (which I have to say was a haven after fighting the crowds that the weekend bought with it) which give u instant access to all fastpass rides   these were hardly worth their while once the weekend hit. They had been invaluable on the thurs and fri beforehand and don't think our 10 yr old releases how lucky she is. If I ever came back again which is unlikely it would without doubt be on weekdays and not in school hols pls take this advice seriously,Disneyland_Paris
117603178,1,2011-8,United Kingdom,"My next line should be 'and now cancel Christmas' ; )  many people seem to love it but this is my view:Admittedly I'm not particularly in to theme parks but this was a major let down. We managed to keep our negativity away from the kids who said they enjoyed it but I think they couldn't comprehend how little there actually is to do except walk around shops and queue.The first hour was exciting but things turned bad once we started to realised the queues were huge and the rides rubbish.We only got on 2 rides plus the train (UK bank holiday I guess making it busy but as the French schools were back it was worse than expected). The Star Wars ride was poor. Entrance price, food and drink was quite unbelievably overpriced   It was very much like walking around the Trafford Centre and getting your wallet stolen.Yes that's my best description: The place is like a tacky shopping centre with endless overpriced gift shops and hardly anything for the kids to do.",Disneyland_Paris
117560278,2,2011-4,United States,"The best thing about going here was the train ride from Paris , beautiful scenery. I think we spent less than an hour in the park, once we got through the wait of a snake line to get into the park. FEW rides, very small compared to USA Disney parks. Huge waste of admission price and time, did not go on one ride as lines so long and not enough rides for people to disperse to.",Disneyland_Paris
117496002,3,2011-8,United States,"We have been to this park several times but it has been nine years since our last visit. It is very easy to reach the park from Paris on the RER train. The trains run very frequently, but just make sure you have the time for the last train back. It is far enought that it would be very expensive to take a taxi back to Paris. The train ticket was 7 Euros and well worth it. On this trip, we purchased a one day park hopper ticket. It is worth the extra few dollars to make it a hopper ticket because both parks are small and there is time to see both parks with a one day ticket. It should be noted, we have been to all the Disney Parks with the exception of Hong Kong and this one, by far, is the lowest as far as standards. We arrived thirty minutes after opening and went right to the favorite rides, Big Thunder Mountain and Haunted Mansion only to find both were broken with no estimate time of opening. We did other rides and then came back and Thunder Mountain was open. After waiting in line for 45 minutes, the ride broke (again) and we were escorted out without being given a fast pass or some type of get to the front of the line pass. It should be noted, while waiting in line for this ride, I saw something I have never seen at Disney. In the landscaped area, there was some type of food items in the dirt and there was a mouse eating it. Yes, a mouse and not Mickey and Minnie I might add. Not something expected that's for sure. After hitting the big rides in DL, we went over to the Disney Studios Park. In this park, the Aerosmith ride was missing the loud music which makes the ride, however, the Tower of Terror was working fine and enjoyed several times by our kids. We spent the entire day at both parks and don't want to make it sound like it was bad or unenjoyable, but it was just different. Disney maintains high standards of cleanliness and it just wasn't like that here. There was food in the landscape areas (as noted above), there was chewed gum all over the roof of Thunder Mountain that was visible while standing in line, and there were large cracks and holes in the concrete between the two parks. This is something you would never see at another Disney Park. Everything is always meticulous and to see large areas of concrete that had tiles missing and uneven edges that can cause tripping or falling is disappointing. With that said, if you are in Paris, have kids or adults that like Disney, it is worth the trip. We are big fans of Disney and wouldn't have missed it, but are glad we only did a one day ticket. For a truly enjoyable experience, visit Tokyo Disney and Tokyo Disney Sea where you will need several days to see and enjoy the parks.",Disneyland_Paris
117493174,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Good Myself and my husband took our 4 year old girl as a surprise to Disneyland Paris. We was both very excited to be going and couldn't wait to see her face when we got there. We was not disappointed she thought it was fantastic and loved every minute as we did too. Both parks were fantastic and she met loads of characters including her favourites, Rapunzel & Flynn from  Tangled . There were loads of rides for her to go on and she loved the parades,fireworks etc. We had a good time in the restaurants in Disney Village, Planet Hollywood & The Rainforest Cafe which we all enjoyed. Toilets were clean and staff very friendly.Not so goodThere were food carts and takeaway type foods which were okay but very overpriced with not too much choice in both the parks. It would be better & cheaper to use McDonalds or Earl of Sandwich in Disney Village for a snack during the day. The merchandise is very expensive and a lot more than I anticipated. A dressing up outfit with accessories cost   110 compared to approx   40 in the UK. Make sure you take lots of money with you.All in all we were glad that we went and would go back again",Disneyland_Paris
117462602,5,2011-8,United Kingdom,"We love Disneyland. We went in our Motorhome and stayed in the carpark next to the park. Last year, we bought annual tickets which cost 139 Euro each, which allow you to go in to the parks on 330 days of the year. I think buying tickets this way is much more cost effective and you also get free parking. You can find out more about them on the French website or when you get to Disney.",Disneyland_Paris
117415227,5,2011-8,Norway,"We bought our two days tickets for two parks at the internet. We came at disneypark in the afternoon (5 pm). In france they have vacation at this time, but the ques wasnt that long (wount take small kids under 5, some was 60 min wait) Several of the things you can do was really good and well made. The best was the late nigt parade and space mountain.

117363879,4,2011-8,Kenya,"Oh the crowds. Masses and masses of people shoulder to shoulder. Dont go in peak season unless you are prepared for waiting an average 90 mins for a less than 5 mins ride. Food and snacks in the parks are expensive and nothing for vegetarians. Unfortunately no supermarkets near the park so you have toget the food in the park. Line up for the parade at least 45 mins early to get a good view. We preferred the Walt Disney Studios park as its smaller and the parade is earlier so you get back to the hotel earlier. Lots of walking involved, waiting, and your walking shoes must be good. Carry enough water. Toilets not clean. Solution: Go in LOW season. Buy your tickets in advance to save time. Good fun for children of all ages.",Disneyland_Paris
117355323,3,2011-8,United Kingdom,"We went in 3rd week of August and this park and the studios were packed.Have visited at this time in the past, but have never seen the parks with so many people in.If this had been a first visit we would have been hugely disappointed as it was very difficult to get on some of the rides. The queue for Peter Pan (without fast pass) was regularly 60 minutes, for an approximate 90 second ride.Wouldn't visit again at this same time.",Disneyland_Paris
117353989,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,"We went in August this year as part of a trip to Paris. It was very hot and as other reviewers have said the queues really are tiring. The free Fast Pass scheme is great but you can only hold one Fast Pass at a time and as the day goes on some of the Fast Passes give return times 4 5 hours away from the time you arrive at the ride which is a long wait. The queues we experienced varied from 15 minutes for the Mad Hatter's Teacups, 45 minutes for Pirates of the Caribbean and 65 minutes for Big Thunder Mountain. However, it is a theme park and queuing really is part of the drill when you buy your tickets for the park, it's an unavoidable part of visiting. Disney do make the queues work well and the Pirates queue was constantly moving which reduced the likelihood of kids getting impatient.The food in the park is expensive but it is not more expensive than anything we experienced in central Paris, in fact some things were cheaper at Disney! We did see families with their own picnics   food brought into the park which certainly would reduce the cost of the day out. We stayed right until the Illuminations parade and Enchanted fireworks which are a superb end to the day but waiting until 11pm makes for an extremely long day for kids and there were a lot of over tired, crying children leaving the park at the end. I really felt sorry for the parents because it is a great experience for them but just left to a bit too late at night. It was so easy to get the RER to   from the park so I'd definitely recommend using it if you can.",Disneyland_Paris
117346931,3,2011-8,United Kingdom,"This was our third visit to Disneyland Paris. We travelled with 2 children aged 7 and 11. The park opened at 10 am. We arrived about 9.00 am as the park opened at 10 am. We had pre booked tickets, booked through the disney website, you print the tickets at home which saves about 15% on gate prices per ticket. We booked a one day, 2 park hopper. Only draw back with this is you have to take your passport as id. We qued at the gates from 9.15 and we're allowed into the park from 9.30 am, however access points to areas were still blocked off except to the people that had the additional 2 hours in the park if staying at disney hotels. The biggest tip I would give is to print the park map before you go and plan out which rides you really want to go on and do these first. We went on Star Tours which our 7 year old loved, (I wouldn't rate) Pirates of the Caribean was great, Phantom Manor was great and ITopia. We did want to go on Thunder Mountain but the que for this ride was always at least 60 minutes and this particular area was always very busy.We preferred the rides etc in Walt Studios. I think that the disney park is better if travelling with younger children especially little girls who love the disney princesses. The parade was very good. People were getting into their position about 1   2 hours before the start of the parade!We only visited the parks for one day before heading off to central Paris but one day was more than enough for us. Although we had a great time, all the queing and peoples rudeness was too much for me and I couldn't have done anymore than one day.",Disneyland_Paris
117322963,1,2011-8,United Kingdom,"I went with my wife and 2 young children in August 2011.   we were not allowed children's bad with wheels  food was extremely expensive  drinking water fountains were few and far and many did not work properly  the characters were difficult to approach as many of them did not have proper queue system. You have to push shove.  the rides were rubbish: e.g. we waited 1 hour for armageddon at walt disney studios only to find that you have to just stand and see a few flames, this is pathetic.  the fireworks in the evening behind the castle were the worst I have seen in my life.  the parades are short and simple  there is not many places to sit down; hundreds sit on the curb to eat and see the parades, I had to do the same with my children.  at one of the restuarants which serves mexican food, I ordered vegetarian meal, and there was a small chicken piece!

117296400,4,2011-8,Canada,"This entire trip report with lots of pictures can be seen here: URL  http:  www.disboards.com showthread.php?t 2782763  WDW Vet's First Trip to DLP for b'day with LOTS of pics   URL Thanks for reading! My name is Elizabeth and I took this trip with my DH Marco. We are both 41 (I turned 41 on my first day at DLP), enjoy traveling and having fun and have no kids (unless you count our two dogs, which we do). We have been going to WDW at least once a year for the last 11 years and went to DL in California last year for my 40th b'day. I guess we will headed to Hong Kong next year, huh? LOL.After spending several days in Paris, we took a cab to the RER station and made our way to DLP. I was suprized when we arrived at the train station that we were RIGHT THERE at the entrace of Disney Village and the entrance to both parks were so close. We found the bus for the Kyriad (actually  54 said it was for all 4 hotels). Well, turns out of first  ride  at DLP was a bus ride. We were tired and distracted and thought all buses at the stop went to the Kyriad...not so much. So we came back and made sure the next bus said Kyriad (as it turns out, there ARE some buses that went to all 4..but usually Kyriad was group with Explorers). We went to check in and I was pleased to see that the 3 people in front of us got their rooms right away (it was still in morning and I knew it wasn't check in time, but we were hoping to get lucky). Not so much...so we went to store or luggage (very cool self service area  see pic below) and then boarded the bus to head to Disneyland.As we approached DLP, I LOVED the Mickey clock and thought the Disneyland Hotel was just incredible..talk about a great location...how could you beat it? If money was no object, that would be where I would stay hands down. Thanks to the DIS website, I had no purchased my tickets in advance as the Fantasy Pass was not only the least expensive option, but also came with great perks and discounts. The line to get the temp pass went very quickly. The parks were realy busy all three days we were there but we used FPs and just  went with the flow . We went and got a FP for Space Mountain because I had heard such wonderful things about the coaster. It turns out the stand by time was only 20 minutes, so we rode it and then got right back on with our FP. I must say this coaster is just incredible...fast and fun and well themed, but I banged my head on the harness really hard (I had a bump on my head for days after). The second time, I not only kept my head back, but also tilted my head up a little. We were both immediately impressed with this coaster and knew we would ride this over again. We left SM and rode Buzz Lightyear. The version here is like the version in California. The one in WDW has the gun mounted on the ride and you don't have to continously pull the trigger. I just press it down at the beginning and start aiming. We still had fun and knew better for the next time (BTW  I won!) It was pretty funny listening to Buzz Lightyear speak French.By now it was getting to be lunch time, so I checked the map and gave Marco options. He chose Toad Hall, which was located in the next land. We headed that way for Fish and Chips and were lucky enough to find a table inside. It was just OK.After lunch, we checked the map and headed to Pirates. We loved the building and really liked this version and we knew this would be a ride we would have to ride again. As we left, we went to see if we could get a reservation at Blue Lagoon for that night. This is VERY different than the booking 180 days in advance for WDW. I was hoping to get to eat there for my b'day dinner.We then headed to Phantom Manor as I was really curious about it (Haunted Mansion is one of my favourite rides). It was really cool...but I didn't get the story. What happened to the groom? Was the groom the bad guy? And why in the world did we end up in the old west (is that because we are in Frontierland? WEIRD).We got a FP for Indy for later before we left. DH noticed that there was no Mickey ice cream treats but we both really liked the  Magnum  ice cream treats.We also check out the castle, including the dragon (HOW COOL) before leaving to the hotel to check in, unpack a little and shower before coming back that night.We headed to Blue Lagoon and we were very happy to get a table for 2 right by the water. Last year, we ate at this restaurant's equivalent in California, but could have not been further from the water.We opted for the appetizer entree combo. DH got the crab appetizer (which was yummy) and I got the shrimp (which was also yummy). For our entrees, DH got the parrotfish and I got the fish wrapped in banana leaf and both were really good. I love how the rice was served in a coconut shell. We split the banana 3 ways dessert and then headed to Indy. Indy was a fun but really short ride. I was glad we had FPs for the ride.We were tired and it had been a busy day, so we headed back to the room to go to bed and plan the next day. We thought we would start at the Studios the next dayDay 2So the night before we left, we stopped by City Hall to make ressies for Agrabah Cafe for lunch the next day and ask about EMHs. I was suprized to find that we did not qualify staying at the Kyriad, but I still think we got to do what we wanted to do within the parks during our 3 days.We were at the Studio for 9:30 and headed straight for Crush as soon as we got in.I was suprized that there was no FP because I would have gotten one and then gotten in line. DH and I are coaster freaks and I must say this one was not a let down at all. The theming was great and the spinning was wonderful and the track was so smooth. LOVED IT!We wanted to head to Amimagique and saw that the first show was at 10:45 so we had some time to kill so we headed to Tower of Terror.This version is like the one in California and not like the one in WDW (which when the beginning intro is over, you move forward into the elevator shaft). I still love that ride and wanted to definitely ride it again. We checked the time and still had some time, so we headed to Rock N Rollercoaster. Hubby said  I don't think this has Aerosmith in it  and I looked up at the sign and then noticed they were playing music not by Aerosmith. Then I saw Aeromsith on a sign...so we entered not really knowing what we were expecting. The pre show with the band was super super short. If you don't know what I mean, youtube the WDW version. In the speakers before we launched, I heard someone testing tweeters and said  AWW...Man...no Steven Tyler  and about that time, he started talking. I just thought the theming wasn't done as well as the WDW version, but it was still fun.So we headed into the park and stopped to get a FP for Big Thunder Mountain before heading to Agrabah Cafe. We have Lebanese at least once a week, so I was really looking forward to this.We got there, paid right away and were shown to our seats and told where the buffet was. All I can say is YUM. We did eat lots as we had no breakfast and it was just too good to pass up. THAT WAS THE BEST HUMMUS I HAVE EVR HAD and I told the chef that also. The carrot salad and the make your own sandwich was yummy.During lunch, I noticed there was a Tarzan show starting soon. There used to be a production at WDW called Tarzan Rocks that we really loved (so very cool and it featured live music). We headed that way and that was a nice flashback to the former show..(just need to add the musicians and rollerblading and BANG..there ya go). Really great show and nice to do right after that big lunch.We headed back to BTM to use our FPs and the ride was down. So, we did Phantom Manor again (so awesome) and when we got out BTM was still down, so we did the Molly Brown boat. In all the years we have been going to WDW, we have never ridden the Liberty Bell (why? I am not sure) and we got some great view of BTM and PM from the boat.When we got off, BTM was still down. We normally at this point at WDW would take an afternoon break, but we decided to head to the other park to watch some shows instead. We had 3 days there and wanted to see as much as we could. As we were headed out, an entire bunch of Mickey and Minnie balloons were let go (a sight I have never seen before).Normally at WDW, this would be the time that we would head back to the hotel for a break (nap swim shower), but we decided we had very little time to experience the parks, so we headed to the Studios to do some shows as a break.We had seen the Motor Action show before, but never in both languages and not since Lightning McQueen was added. The show was great as usual.After we left, the line for RNR was slow, so we did the coaster again. We headed to Stitch Live (which was geared for kids, but I still liked it...DH thought the voice could be better).Then we did the Backlot tour, where we saw something we have never seen at WDW. We saw staff members headed into work in street clothes. They were headed into a gate near the Tram. It just kinda spoils some of the magic or something. This attarction is pretty short and not much to it. Our screen was not working and I recognized Jeremy Iron's voice, but who was the female...was it Juliette Binoche?After we left, we saw the last showing of Cinemagique, which was just incredible..that is a not to be missed indeed. Again, was the girl in the film Julie Delphy??Then we debated on whether or not to head back to the room, but it was 7:15 and we knew we wanted to see the nighttime parade and fireworks, so we headed to Disney Village for some shopping (I got a Stitch hat and some pins and DH got a T shirt) and then headed to Earl of Sandwich for dinner before heading back to Disneyland.Once we got back into the park, we headed to BTM to use the FPs (they let us because they knew the ride had been broken down). We know at WDW and DLR, you can use FPs late, but I wasn't sure if the same was true here.WHAT A GREAT RIDE!! i love that it was on an island and it was smooth and fast and so fun. SO..if you are keeping score, I prefer the DLP's versions on Pirates, SM, BTM and PM(HM). We checked the time and decided to do Space Mountain once more. We figured we could do it and then find a spot for the evening parade and fireworks. Wouldn't you know it...the ride broke down...but we stayed and hung in there but by the time we got out, the parade had started. So we decided to ride Buzz Lightyear again.As we were leaving, we decided to stay for the fireworks so the next night, we could leave right after the parade. I was amazed that people we able to climb up on the fenced in areas down Main Street. This wouldn't be allowed at WDW.I saw that the fireworks were called Enchanted, but I was clueless to the fact that this was based on the film (which I just love) so I was happy to hear the music. The fireworks were good but not on the grand scale at WDW.Once the fireworks were done, we headed to our room. We were lucky yet again that we didn't have to wait for the bus.The next day, we would start at the Studios and Crush again, lunch at Disney Village and then back to DLP. Day 3We slept really great because we were exhausted and we were at the Studio for opening...and headed straight for Crush again. It took longer today so we did some shopping, grabbed a crossaint and then headed to Animagique. This reminded me of a show at WDW DHS based around the Little Mermaid. It was very cute and cool, but I prefer Cinemagique to this one.We headed to Tower of Terror once more and then headed to Disney Village.I found this really cool plaque on the way there. It was a compass with directions (N, S, E W) and showed how far away the other parks were.We went to Annette's for lunch. I read in the Unofficial Guide that this was the best burger in Paris (although it was expensive). While it was good, I disagree. I only had two burgers in Paris but the one at Breakfast in America was better. The dessert was incredible though...YUM.After lunch, we headed into the parks. It was kinda chilly and rainy, so we both got new hoodies (mine has Stitch on it...who I LOVE). Then we got a FP for BTM. We decided to do Phantom Manor one last time and we noticed the day before on the that there was a cemetary, so we wanted to check that out too.We still had plenty of time before our FP, so we did Pirates one more time. DH decided he wanted to ride the railroad all the way around, so we headed for Main Street. On our way, the princesses arrived at the center, so I was able to get a picture with Cinderella and Prince Charming (yes, I am a big kid at heart).The railroad was crazy busy and no one was getting off, so we bailed on that and I said I was curious about Alice's maze, so we headed that way. Yeah...we were in and out of there quickly..definitely more for kiddos in our opinion.I can't believe we would ever ge hungry again, but we were, so we got some gellato across from IASM (which was good).While we were there, we saw something you wouldn't see at WDW. There was a CM there with a Cafe Hyperion uniform on. At WDW, CMs can't cross lands. They also have rules about appearance (no long nails, no visible tattoos, one hole in each ear for females only are the only piercing allowed, one hair colour only). Now..you should know I have several tattoos, a cartildge piercing on my ear and have had highlights..so this isn't a judgement. Just an observation. In addition, we saw some maintenance need at DLP that wouldn's be acceptable at WDW. Also, the happy vibe with the CMs just isn't there...don't get me wrong, most CMs were very helpful and pleasant, but at WDW, it not only happens between CMs and guests, but between guests...very few other guests said boo to us. Maybe a cultural thing. I am happy girl...I smile and say hello (I was raised in the South and have lived in Canada...that's how we roll) but some people looked at me like I was nuts. Oh well...Anyway...back to my story...we were sitting there and I realised that it was almost 5 and the clock at IASM would be going off soon. I love the clock. I saw this for the first time last year in California (which, also by the way, has Ariel and Lilo Stitch and Jasmin Aladin added...really cute touch). At WDW, the clock is painted on a wall (BOO). I am only allowed to ask DH to ride this ride every few years, but he caved and we rode it (the line was fast) before heading back to BTM.On the way to BTM, we took the time to explore the castle (which was really pretty).Then off to ride BTM again (LOVE IT) before heading to find a good spot for the parade. Now, you may have noticed, I like taking pictures...so I show up for parades about an hour before so I can be in the front. You may also have noticed (or maybe not), DH is pretty tall. We sometimes (mind you, not all the time..depends on many things..how we feel, how the parents kids act), ask if little ones would like to stand in front of us. We did that this time as well and the mother pushed her way up there as well and got in my shot several times. NOT COOL. Give people an inch...they take a mile sometimes.Ahem...oh yeah, back to happy thoughts. While we were waiting for the parade, we saw the cross uniform thing again. There was a pirate helping control main street (which, now that I think about it, could be a good thing...I wanted that pushy mom to walk the plank).The parade was really great. My fav float was the villian one.After the parade, we got a quick bite to eat at Casey's. The WDW has two things this version should DEMAND..spicy relish and corn dog nuggets.We rode Space Mountain one more time (love it and hate to think how let down I will be at WDW in September) and also explored the Nautilus (the equid was cool). I checked the time (wanted to be up front again for Fantallusion) and we had time for one more ride...Phantom Manor (how many times did we ride this? Like 5 maybe...awesome ride) and then got in line for the parade.The parade was really great. WDW has a night time parade called Spectromagic that we love. Last year and this year also, it is being replaced with the Main Street Electrical parade..which we don't really like that much. I get the sentimental thing (I saw it as a kid too) but we love Spectro).My fav part of Fantalusion was the black light part of Act 2...very cool.Now, I really wanted to stay and see the fireworks again, but I was exhausted...and we had two flights the next day..so we bid DLP adieu.Would we come back? You betcha. Did I love it? Absolutely. Was I let down? Not in the least. Was it worth it? Without a doubt.SO...any WDW vets that are thinking about doing this, my advice is to go for it. So many of the attractions here are incredible and many are better than the WDW version.                   We got out and checked the time, but it was too late for the show, but still we had more time before lunch, so we did the Armageddon attraction (which was pretty neat) and then headed to Disneyland for an amazing lunch.",Disneyland_Paris
117257017,5,2011-8,Singapore,"I was there with my girlfriend and we loved it. We've also been to the Los Angeles one together and she likes this one a million times more. They also have the Space Mountain Mission 2 ride. We had no idea what it was going to be like and it turns out there's two 360 turns in the dark. It's the best roller coaster I've ever been on! We didn't end up staying for the parade or the fireworks, but it was still a fantastic experience!",Disneyland_Paris
117220805,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Arrived. Very hot, 30plus degrees, which is great, but waiting for sometimes 90 minutes for a 5 min ride, is shocking, stifling when undercover, could have done with some overhead fans. what we found is a lot of adults without children, we felt they should have adult day only or week once a month. Dont get me wrong it is for them to enjoy too but it makes the queues longer and the kids get bored waiting for so long. It took us nearly 5 days to do 90% of the rides due to the amound of queuing you have to do. Unless you get a fast pass, but to be honest spending 1500 on the holiday then having to fork out extra for fast pass was a no go. Drink and food prices extortionate for what you got, have eaten in some very high standard restaurants all over the world for less. my husband had saukraut and german meats for 25 pounds over in uk I shouldnt even think it would be 10 pounds in a restaurant. Worthwhile to see our 5 year olds face, exhausting, but good.",Disneyland_Paris
117220696,5,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Kids loved it. Probably not much more to say other than:  bring plenty of money  expect to queue, in summer when we went up to an hour per ride  be aware that the fast ticket system doesn't cover many of the rides for smaller children (so you will have to queue with them)  expect to have to start queing for parades early  for those of you expecting the all Amercian Disney experience go to the US, as there were lots of attractions with mainly French narrative (and to be honest I think it would be cheaper to go to the US)  the park doesn't seem to enforce any No Smoking rules, so watch your little ones in queues and when walking about as most smokers seem to keep their fags at child eye height.",Disneyland_Paris
117176627,4,2011-5,United States,"First of all, this theme park, originally named Eurodisney Paris, then renamed Disneyland Park, is NOT a clone of Disneyland and    world. Nevertheless, it is a fun place with many really good rides that give you a good thrill, exciting shows (the stunt show was pretty awesome) and other, indoor shows and presentations, also in 3D. The shopping arcade as you enter, IMHO, was, well, the usual expensive, not to say overpriced kitsch, and food inside the park is very expensive. It seems also a bit much that officially, you   re not allowed to bring your own food and drink into the park     that makes it really hard on families with several children     and don   t go for lunch at high noon, go early or late, or be prepared to stand in live forever, but not as neatly as at home, there can be some pretty uncivilized pushing in and jumping the line. The restrooms might also have very long lines     on the whole though, as an attraction, the park is worth seeing     but like I said, they   ll make you pay for it, and then some.",Disneyland_Paris

117144817,5,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Although i enjpoyed the studios more, the Disney Land Park is excellent, you cannot fault how weel it is the run. However this comes at a price. Firstly you pay! Tickets to get in are very high and everything in the park is very expensive. If you are staying at one of the hotels, go for the halfboard upgrade, as you can use this in quite a few different resturants and this does give you a reasonable saving.Queues when we visited weren't too bad, max we queued was 30 mins, but we made good use of fastpass tickets and didn't do the really big rides like Thunderr mountain. We stayed in area of four days and loved all four of them. If opushed you can probably do Studios in one day and Park in two, but slightly less hetic if you can spare the four days or more.",Disneyland_Paris

Other than that it was self catering & you need a mortgage to shop on site! The children loved breakfast with Mickey etc. & as my grandchildren are coeliacs they done them proud with plenty for them to eat. Long wait for rides, so get there early. Food & drink on site expensive 2 &half pints of lager 20 euros! The children loved it all, the adults were worn out!

117046910,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Be prepared to pay a lot of money for anything you buy. The average increase is a minimum of 60% more than UK standard prices. A very important tip l would give to parents with young families is make sure you take your kids to the toilet before queuing as sometimes the wait is much longer than stated. We queued for a ride which stated 15 mins waiting time, 50 mins later we got on. A few of the rides were well over an hour waiting Queuing is a very big part of the park so use Fast Pass were possible & also if staying in the hotels make good use of being able to use certain marked out fun rides between 8am 10am as the parks open to the public at 10am. Have plenty of chilled fluids with you..Follow these simple tips & you will be prepared. Oh & bring plenty of camera roll as the characters are all over the place & you can freely take your own photos of them as well as the official photographer taking his also.",Disneyland_Paris
117025557,4,2011-8,United States,"We visited the resort for three days and spent a lot of the time either queuing or looking around for things.As this was a holiday for the children, rather than the adults, it was okay. However, I did find that the amount of time we had to wait for rides in the boiling sun was awful   more shade is definitely needed. People (other than the British) would send one person to a queue and once they were near the front the whole family would push through to get to the ride. This was not fair and needed someone to stop this happening.There were not enough Disney characters around and the ones that were there you needed to queue to see. When Goofy came to our hotel the 4 year old I was with ran towards him and the woman that was accompanying him pushed her away TWICE. I did voice my concerns!On the whole, adults didn't seem to care about young children and when we were at the parade they pushed in front of the 4 and 2 year olds that we had with us.Price wise, everything inside is really expensive, but to be fair, there were also quite a few water fountains (of different heights), which were free of charge, so there was no real excuse to get dehydrated. This is a real experience, so my advice is be prepared and have a good time.",Disneyland_Paris
117001407,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,Disney studios was great with some great new rides since we last visited. The queue times were pretty horrendous though. The parades and fireworks were spectacular and this is what makesa disney experience!,Disneyland_Paris
116999269,3,2011-8,United Kingdom,"A holiday at Disneyland Paris in August was always going to overcrowded but I was taken aback by the vast crowds and how many people they let in at once.We travelled by Eurostar and the journey was excellent.The train was on time,and clean, booking in simple and straightforward.As the station is right next to the Park Disney Express means you can leave your luggage and get on with having fun.I would certainly not leave it much less than hour before the train departs to book in, the French end stopped checking in 30mins before departure.We stayed at Sequoita Lodge, and this is a 5 min stroll from the Village, but the pool was shut twice out of the three times we went to use it (Water quality and a child having a poo being the reasons given for it being shut)On a more serious note in the pool ,chaos reigned somewhat with the Lifeguards annoymus and two even three people on the water slide at once.I had a go on the slide and found an unpleasant pile of corn and toe plasters on the side.Clearly not regularly checked The buffet breakfast was no better than the one we had one a few years ago at Cheyanne.Scaffold was up on the outside of our lodge. Our room was clean but I suffer from sleep apnoea and have a res med machine. The plus were positioned I had to sleep at the wrong end of the bed. I would have asked for an extension lead but the staff were few and far between and the hotel crowded.So overall I did not feel it was worth paying the extra money for this hotel other than its location and proxiemity to park.Onto the park, on our first day Mon 14 08 11 the Indiana Jones and Thunder Mountain Rides broke down,on 16 06 11Buzzlightyear ride kept stopping but I did get a high score! on 17 08 11 the Crush roller coaster broke down( culminating in a 2 hour wait). The following was under renovation and out of use Adventure land Pirate ship and Swiss Family Robinson Tree House .The rides were good , motor stunt show brilliant and seek out the annimation academy where kids get a class on how to draw mickeyWalts Gibson Girl restaurants had hordings up and being renovated.Some of the staff were very good and added to the experience others looked totally cheesed off.Two incidents sum this up. Bad:, a lady had a panic attack in the studios and after 5 mins no staff had noticed.Good: Staff at City hall offerred help when they realised I had been seperated from myfamily and had been wandering around for 15 mins and eventually helped me find them.We had pre paid vouchers for meals but give them a miss, they are a pain to use and plan themeals,but do book well ahead for popular venues such as Mickeys Cafe.I expected it to be busy but overallI think Disney allow too many people in the Parks and could make everyones time more enjoyable by cutting down enteries by 10 to 20%",Disneyland_Paris

116968337,3,2011-8,France,"While we left with huge smiles on our faces, but I can't imagine we ll be back soon. The cynicism turned our stomachs. Food and souvenir prices were beyond outrageous; Disney knowing full well that enough parents are simply going to cave in to their childrens' begging, since making them happy is why they agreed to subject themselves to endless queuing in the first place. F  k you, Disney Corp. Second complaint: some of the rides, I kid you not, last about two minutes. The Indiana Jones roller coaster is amazing, but over in a flash. Ditto the Orbitron. While occasionally the lines move quicker than the given estimates, seriously, how utterly infuriating. My friend actually queued with his two daughters for an hour, only to have the fire services close the ride moments before they were getting on. As to the staff: many friendly and helpful, many not quite so much. Also, would it kill them to post more direction signs? The maps provided can only help you orient so much when you can't see what's where through the throng of thousands of people. Otherwise, the parades and late evening sound and light shows were my favourite feature. Many things were done brilliantly. But the cloying sense of Disney wanting your last euro, in the most cynical way imaginable, put me and my friends with children off, big time.",Disneyland_Paris
116933483,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,if you dont like crowds and queing then its not for you. we had great weather which helped but with so many people it became overwhelming. the queues for some rides went past the hour even fast pass made you come back a few hours later and then there was a 30 minuite wait on them. the drinks and food is pricey so take bottles of water or juice from the restaurant in the morning and make up ham rolls from the breakfast to keep costs down. if was going again i would go out of season.,Disneyland_Paris
116907227,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Hi we've just come back from France and our trip to Disney. We drove via EuroTunnel with Tesco VouchersStayed in a Gite in Champagne for a week   40mins drive to Disney.Ordered tickets via the french ticket agency FNAC   picked them up from a nearby Carrefour supermarket with no problems.Were concerned it would be busy with long queues as is school hols   but was totally fine, with rides first thing, get fast passes for rides later on and then shows in the afternoon, few more rides in the evening. We have a 5 year old, so the rides we went on were geared towards that age!Visited Disney Park on Tuesday, got there at 9am, parked in Disney Village car park   very easy and so close! had to exchange tickets for ones you swipe through the turnstiles, in park by 9:30am. Although official opening time is 10am   get to Disneyland Park early   they let you into the Main Street at 9:30am where the shops are already open and then cast members let you into each of the lands at 10am. By 10:30am we'd already been on It's a Small World (lovely) and Peter Pan ( Jerky, too dark to see any of the PEter Pan scenes), and were in the Labyrinth, then did Storybook Boats. Petit Train (good spot round there for meeting disney characters), got fast pass for Buzz Lasers, ate picnic lunch whilst watching Disney Express show, afternoon did shopping, Buzz Lasers, (Keel Boats were shut), Peter Pan Show, Pochontas Playground, then went to Disney Village for dinner in Rain Forest Cafe. Back into Disney Park for Parade, Mickey's Magic Show, Fantillusion and Fireworks!On Thursday   had 1 day 2 park tickets so we could do the Studios, but also go back to Disney in the evening. We arrived at the Studios   again easy to exchange tickets for swipe ones & much shorter queues to do that than at Disney Park. The Studios don't let people through until 10am, unlike Disneyland Park. But still worth getting there a little early to be one of the first in the queues   really gives a head start on rides! Got fast pass for Hollywood Hotel, Straight on Studio Tram Tour   fab, then Slinky Dog, hubby then went on Hollywood Hotel, met Mickey, got fast passes for Flying Carpets, Playhouse Disney Show, ate picnic lunch on bench, Flying Carpets, Moteur Show   fab, Cinemagic, Animagic, Stars n Cars Parade (good, much shorter than Disney Parade finishes with performance in the circle). We did avoid the Cars ride   75min wait for what was essentially a 2 min Bumper Cars ride!We ate dinner at MacDonald's in the Village (no vegy options & ran out of ice cream!), then back into Disney Park, Autopedia, shopping, explored Fort, Pirate Cove, Pirate Beach, Snow White (not great ride), Small World and then the Disney Train to take us back up to the end. Really surprised how much we managed to do at such a busy time of year!Disappointed with Peter Pan ride particularly, Snow White is not great. Also, some of the ride staff were not particularly welcoming seemed a little miserable!, although those in the shops and shows were fantastic. Only little gripes, but we did have a great time!",Disneyland_Paris
116896817,5,2011-8,United Kingdom,"This was our first time to any Disney park and we weren't disappointed at all.We felt with our kids at 9 and 6 that they were at a great age and that was definitely the case.We had the 2 Day 2 Park hopper tickets and on the first day we started at Disneyland Resort; we spent so long there we didn't have time to visit Walt Disney Studios before it shut at 7pm.Disneyland Resort is absolutely amazing, and we chose to go on a rainy day meaning that it perhaps wasn't as busy as other days. We managed to get on all the rides we went to, with an average queue time of around 15 mins per ride.The second day we went to Walt Disney Studios first, which is good but doesn't quite have the same magical quality as the other park.We went back to Disneyland for the night time parade and the fireworks which is definitely worth the wait for the kids to see.However, I would mirror other comments about the lack of healthy food options and I was very disappointed that people are allowed to smoke anywhere, its totally disgusting.Overall though we had a magical experience, we'll probably try Florida resort in a couple of years too !",Disneyland_Paris
116883705,4,2011-2,Australia,"We went in Feb 2011,initially, disneyland didn't feature in out itinerary. But we were done with almost all the historical places in paris & looking for a change. & what a day we had!!! totally relaxing & enjoyable...But its important to get infomation about the parks & rides. There are two parks,disneyland park & walt disneyland studio. Better to get aquinted with them on the website before u decide whether to visit both or one of them.Since we went in off season,though the crowd didn't make me feel so, we got heavy discount on the entry fee.Also, its not practically possible to cover all the rides in one day, so select your favourites from the brochure that you will get. Some which I really liked were  Indiana Jones    and the Temple of Peril,Pirates of Carribean,big thunder mountain,space mountain mission2,star tours,its a small world,Sleeping Beauty Castle. But it all depends whom are you going with, kids will like fantasyland more.Watch out for the parades, they will announce it... it wonderful to see the characters u grew with in person!! when in disneyland always keep your camera ready.The visit to walt disney park gives an insight into the magical world of special effects & the labor that goes into the making of animation.Armageddon Special Effects,Studio tram tour, they are all so thrilling..For kids, stitch live is a must! My suggestion would be to go to both the parks, how often will u visit disneyland paris!! Do buy some souvinier from the park shop for lovely memory. Watch out for the weather though, it rained in evening when we went & it spoilt the fun. Overall, a good family & frenz dayout..",Disneyland_Paris
116867608,4,2011-8,Australia,"Before I left for Paris with my family I read all the reviews on Tripadvisor and nearly didn't go at all. I was a little concerned by all the negative comments about the park looking run down or messy. I found it to be the complete opposite. Everything looked beautiful, the gardens and flowers were utterly amazing. The entrance to the park nearly took my breath away, it is much prettier than LA Disney while the shops and attractions all in good condition. We found the staff friendly and the food very good, I was of course worried about that after some of the reviews I'd read also but everything was fine. The things I didn't like were the crowds and one two hour wait for every ride and the smelly toilets. I've never been to a ladies bathroom that stunk like a men's urinal before at a theme park so I was really put off by that. Each bathroom had the same smell, odour la toilet! Someone should teach the Parisians a thing or two about toilet cleaners and air fresheners! On the up side, it was one of only two places in all of Europe that had toilet seats so that is always a plus :) Aside from those two things my family had a magical day. The highlight for us was the Grand Parade in the evening, it was the only time we saw any of the star attractions like Mickey, Mini, Donald, Goofy and friends. The success of the day could only be measured in my 6 year olds words  I never want to leave .",Disneyland_Paris
116863768,4,2011-8,Switzerland,"Before going to Disneyland, you really need some researches. Disneyland Paris got 2 parks and they are big. There are so many helpful information that you can get, for example, Tripadvisor reviews   which help me a lot   also now there is an iPod, iPad, iPhone Application for Disneyland Paris(i think Android Phone can download too, but I'm not sure since I didn't use Android Phone) From the application you will get the map of the 2 parks, both Disney Studio and Disneyland Park, also the information of every ride and attractions, the waiting time(when you are at the Park already), the show and stuffs   i think that's pretty cool :)So yes, just really prepare yourself before you go there. Research about the ride and plan your trip. I bought the ticket for 2 Parks in one day but I prepared myself well by looking at the information and decide which rides or attractions I would like to go, also prepare to get the Fastpass for some rides. By the end of the day, I was happy coz I have actually done most of the rides as I expected. Therefore, get the information and plan ahead will help you a lot to enjoy the Disneyland.Going there on weekday is much less people. We went there on Tuesday :) Please noted that on Wednesday it's just like Saturday in France. The schools are closed on Wednesday, so if you can skip that day will help with crowded and so. Therefore, you don't have to wait so long in the line. The waiting time maximum for me is 80 minutes and others are like 60 mins, 40 mins, 30 mins, which is not so bad. The park open 10.00 22.00, we went there just when the park open and back around 21.00.About the rides, I must say that if you like the thrill and exciting rides do not miss1. Crush & Coasters2. Rock n' Roller Coaster3. Tower of Terror4. Big Thunder mountain5. The Idiana Jones Ride6. Space mountain The attractions that I think it's cool to look at 1. Armageddon2. Studio Tram Tour3. Pirate of the CarribbeanThere are lots more rides and attractions but since I didn't go for all of them, so I just really can't recommend much ;) but I hope it will be great for you to check it outI recommend you to take drinks and sandwiches if you willing not to waste time with having lunch in the park. For me, the food and drinks in the park actually not that expensive and it's actually great. But for lunch time, I just stand in the line queuing for the ride that is not too extreme and having my lunch there, so yeah, by the time you get to the ride you already had your lunch and ready to explore more. For myself, I choose to queuing for Studio Tram Tour and having lunch at the same time, it was around 40 minutes waiting on the line. There are plenty of snacks and drink in the park, which is for me it's okay, not that expensive. You can enjoy some, and we decided to have dinner in the park which the food is not that bad and also the price is not that high. I think it's quite okay actually about the food and drinks in the Disneyland.So overall our visiting in Disneyland Paris is great. We had a great time and enjoy so much. Just the waiting time might be too long and annoying, but yeah, by the end of the day I was happy and I think it's worth to come and enjoy the magical moments here once in Europe.",Disneyland_Paris
116839317,1,2011-8,Cyprus,"The rating is for this ride specifically! Our Disneyland experience was great! We visited 10 days ago and had an amazing time! Everything is so dreamy! The place is clean, long queues as we expected but very impressive in general! The ridiculously expensive food is another story! The only attraction I absolutely hated was Space Mountain Mission 2. I don't have motion sickness or anything but I think there should be some kind of warning to people for what they have to go through in there! Before you know it you're upside down and turned around in every direction in total darkness, (while you 're still upside down) then blinding lazers light up in your face while you're roller coasting in very high speed and all this with annoying loud music throughout the ride! Also, I think that they should check their safety regulations for children because yes they put them that belt on, but for a nine year old that plastic thing is not tight enough on their bodies or their heads! My son complained that his head kept hitting right and left and had chest pains (not major but he complained) after the ride! It was hell on earth! I don't recommend it to anyone over 20 or under 12!!! (I'm not a grandma just in my early thirties!!) :))) Seriously I think it's an extreme ride with safety issues!",Disneyland_Paris
116809262,4,2011-4,United Kingdom,"We went as a family in April half term with a 5 year old and a 2 year old expecting it to be chaos, but were pleasantly surprised. Having been to Disney Land Florida and LA, my expectations were that it couldn't live up to the American versions. However the park's themselves are just as good quality with everything you would expect to see in America, the kids loved it!A lot is said about the food and overall the food is of a lesser quality to that in America and in any equivalent UK restaurants, and expensive, a hot dog was 7 euros in the park. Outside the park we had meal vouchers which covered 3 of us and the 2 year old we paid for, my husband paid extra also on occasions for items that were not included in the vouchers. We ate at Annette's Diner which was good and Mickeys cafe for tea which we had to book (I recommend booking as soon as you get there), the service was very slow and the food was ok but to be honest the kids loved the fact that the characters were there and it was a great opportunity for them to meet a variety of characters up close, we met; Mickey, Goofy, Chip, Dale, Eeyore, Pluto and Tigger all in one meal so not bad at all, definitely worth it. Our last meal before we left was lunch in the Rainforest Cafe, which again the kids loved, the service was good as was the food, but VERY expensive we all had 2 courses kids had the meal options and my husband and I had a bottle of beer each and it cost roughly   100, I think for an equivalent meal in the UK it would be more like   60 or less!!The hotel was the Sequia Lodge and was very good, clean rooms, we only met helpful staff, the food I would say was good and there was a good choice at breakfast and evening meal, it is a buffet. We had a drink in the bar before our evening meal and that was also VERY expensive!!! My husband and I had the debate about whether or not it would be worth spending twice the price for the Disney Hotel and although I am a fan of nice hotels I am not sure on balance that I would pay twice the price, as the Sequia Lodge was good. The pool is great, but there's no doubt it is COLD!! We had a few sunny days and it's much warmer outside.Characters   we got plenty of autographs and did plenty of queuing for PRINCESSES ! Most of the other characters were roaming around. There was a bit of a fight to get Woody's autograph but the English handler did her best to get my two an autograph and a photo. The best thing to do is que up at the set times or some of the themed restaurants have their characters walking around which is great. So all in all plenty of opportunity to get autographs. Oh got Minnie and Winnie at our hotel after breakfast!Due to the kids ages there were obviously height restrictions and so it was worth us getting the early entry pass as it meant they were able to get on quiet a few of the more traditional rides like the carousel and tea cups etc and then we were able to get in the early ques for the more popular height appropriate rides that opened at 9am (I think). We were up V EARLY!!!! ; ). Get to the parades a bit before they start, we got there between 1hour and 1 2 an hour before and sat with an ice cream waiting which was a welcome break! Again, kids loved it! I did notice that the big rides during our week were packed so I guess early queuing is necessary. Not all rides are open early!. Lastly we highly recommend the Wild West Show even the 2 year old loved it! We had front row seats and it was great fun, LOUD but great fun, make sure you wear you hat ; )!Overall it is EXPENSIVE! We went expecting to spend a fortune and we nearly did. but there are ways of doing it more cheaply. We went on the Euro tunnel but I reckon driving would save some money as you could stock up at a supermarket with snacks, especially if Disney is only one part of your trip!I would recommend it but just remember you are in France not America so people will speak French! We actually heard someone complaining about that!! Having said that most of the princess characters I heard speaking at least 3 different languages, impressive! Have Fun!!",Disneyland_Paris
116774979,5,2011-7,Canada,"I've been to the Disney Parks in Florida (multiple times) and California. This park was not as good as the others but still excellent. I was disappointed and frankly surprised to see people permitted to smoke at Disneyland Paris. I suppose this IS France, and smoking is still very popular there. It was also surprising to see trash on the ground. I'm used to seeing Disney Cast Members sweep up bits of garbage within an instant of it landing on the ground. Not so in Paris. Lastly, we stayed to see the night time parade with all the spectacular light up floats. We were seated along the parade route just before the main entrance. There was still a fair way to go before the floats were to exit the route, but many had no lights on and they appeared to be packing them up right before our eyes. Besides all that, we truly enjoyed our visit to Disneyland. We particularly enjoyed exploring Sleeping Beauty's castle, seeing the stained glass, going out on the parapets to look down on the kingdom and descending into the dungeon to witness the slumbering dragon. The updated Pirates of the Caribbean ride was great. The Space Mountain ride was mind rattling and a little too much for me, but everyone else was loving it. The park has it's own rail stop on one of the Paris RER lines, so you can save the price of parking or bus transport if you already have Metro passes that you purchased for traveling around Paris. It is however in the furthest zone  5  of the Metro system, so make sure you have a pass that goes that far. Over all it's worth the trip no matter how you get there.",Disneyland_Paris
116773593,5,2011-7,Belgium,"I visited Disney during July with average weather but everything was great. We had princess Dinner (my daughter is 5,5y old). Everything was what you expect to be... it's expensive but every dollar euro was spend with pleasure.  We had Disney hotel (nearby entrance).",Disneyland_Paris
116752811,2,2011-7,Ireland,"I visited Disneyland Paris on 6th July 2011.We arrived at 10.30am. We were 7 adults and 4 children 1yr old to 6yr old. We had a nice day but overall it was a disappoinment:The Castle had a crane on it all day   not very picturesque!There were a number of rides closed   pirates of the caribbean was covered in scaffolding.There were signs up for a number of restaurants   particularly the pizza place and the wild west place   they were both closed.We arrived in a buffet restaurant   asked for a table for 11   we were asked 'do you have a reservation?'   the place was almost empty   we said 'No, is it ok?'   to be told 'well I suppose'   Now I do not exaggerate when I say the place was nearly empty!We did not see Micky Mouse but we did see a big RAT running around near the Peter Pan ride!One of the staff on the 'small world' ride checked us rudely because we did not count the baby in my arms as a 'person'   'Why do you say you are 7 when you are 8   why did you say that'? It was just an oversight as the baby was in my arms!After the Alice in wonderland maze, we realised we had dropped our drinking cup for a child between the castle and the exit   not very far   I asked at the exit if I could return to get it  'NO' I was told, I tried to explain that it was nearby   again 'NO, you have to go around again'  5 6 minutes later   the mother ran around the whole maze to get the cup   left on the bin just inside the exit!Coming towards the end of the day, a lot of the rides were only going at half capacity   even though there were still queues. I witnessed an arguement between a cafe staff member and a lady, who had been told the cafe was closing yet myself and a number of other were still being served   the lady's husband was videoing the situation   not very pleasant!The toilets were not very clean   there was a stench of unine in them all, and on checking a number of them, you could finally find one that was ok to use.There really was a lack of 'Magic' in Paris   some of the group had been to Disney in Florida   they found there was no comparison, Paris was a let down.",Disneyland_Paris
116741033,4,2011-8,United States,"I recommend going in off peak season unless you just love to stand in lines. We had a park hopper 2 day pass. Another time I'd skip the extra expense of the hopper and just stay in one park for the entire day. There are rides that are the same as Disney in the USA but also ones that are just in the Paris parks. We concentrated our line time in the rides we'd never ridden before and then went to our favorites. Big Thunder Mountain is marvelous and a longer ride than in the USA parks. The new Crush coaster is fun but beware if you don't like laser images rushing at you. I had to shut my eyes during most of the ride as those kind of images make me ill, but I was still able to totally enjoy the coaster itself. The Indiana Jones coaster was disappointing. It was kind of jerky, the upside loop was too tight and the ride itself is very short. Tower of Terror is the same and is still counted as one of my favorites.",Disneyland_Paris
116713675,3,2011-8,United Kingdom,Well your in france and you have kids of course your going to go to eurodisney .Well for starters my kids are 11 and 9 so kind of in the middle .Couldnt belive you had to pay for the carpark especially after the price of the tickets this should be included in the price but anyway . We went to the walt disney studio on our first day the rides are good and my wee boy loved the stunt show the queues arent that bad some are busier than others but just watch just because your kid is the right height does mean that its suitable . We spend the most of a day there and then went over to the other park. Well walking into disneypark is lovely dream like very clean the rides in here where kind if hit and miss some where good and otheres quite boring .We have been to alton towers which was a quater of the price and the rides there where as good if not better . I dont mean to sound so dishearten but for the price i just expected more . But if your into disney and you have a little princess well they will be in heaven there and you will probably enjoy it more than we did.,Disneyland_Paris
116706227,3,2010-9,United States,"I didnt think Euro Disney lived up the the Disney standards. There were many of the same rides and attractions, but the park just didnt have that  happiest place on earth  feel to it.",Disneyland_Paris
116701903,2,2011-8,United States,"My family has been to Disney on three occasions in Orlando and thought it would be an experience to see Disney in Europe. Unfortunately, we were all disappointed. We stayed at the Newport Bay On Site Hotel. Our room was smoking and the wall paper was peeling. They did move us when we complained to a better room. The check in process was a zoo   loud and disorganized. The attractions and rides were the same quality as US, but the staff doesn't hold a candle to the US standard. They do not greet you, avoid eye contact, and look unhappy. The food buffets, especially breakfast was a disappointment   it was mainly bread and cereal. This is an overpriced attraction in all categories with sub par lodging and food. I would recommend you go to the attraction but know that its not the Disney experience that you expect and love.",Disneyland_Paris
116693841,5,2011-5,United Kingdom,"I went here this year and well, it is amazing. I went with my family and my little sister loved it! I did to :) You have to wait some time for the rides but they are amazing! Would recommend this to family with young children who just want FUN!!! You can have pictures takin with disney chracters, there are shows, great rides and there is a subway just outside the park so you can travel other places to. This is definitly the best amusement park I have been to the ques aren't that bas as say thorpe park. The atmosphere is friendly just go here!! Its amazing :D",Disneyland_Paris
116636477,5,2011-8,United Kingdom,"If like me you've read all the negative reviews on here and been worried, don't be! I don't know where these people must've been but it can't be Disneyland Paris because it's out of this world, fabulous!The entrance to the Disneyland Park is all fountains and flowers: lovely. Once inside you enter Main Street which is a wonderful old fashioned American street, with lots of quaint looking shops and a bandstand, looking up the street is the beautiful Sleeping Beauty castle.As soon as we arrived we spotted several Disney characters in the street and they signed my daughters' autograph books and had pictures taken with them. There were lots of people around but it was easy enough to get to them. During our stay (in mid August so peak time), we encountered a number of characters around the park, some of them in less busy areas, such as Fantasyland near Casey Jnr's circus train where there were hardly any people crowding them, and around another area in Frontierland I think, somewhere called Woody's roundup village, we met some chipmunks, Donald Duck and Jessie from Toy Story and it was very quiet here.To meet the Princesses it's a bit more difficult but not impossible, they appear several times a day in the bandstand near the entrance and you do have to queue a little while and be a bit forceful, there's no room for being shy and retiring or you'll never get a look in, but having said that we did not really encounter the pushing in etc that other reviewers have commented on.As for the park itself, it is immaculate, there was no litter, people are constantly sweeping the streets, the toilets were clean and full of toilet roll. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the characters exceptionally so. I've never been to the American Disneyland but having now been to Paris, I don't see any need to.The queues for the rides were quite long but that's to be expected at any theme park in peak holidays, and queueing time soon passed. We didn't find Disney Studios as good as Disneyland Park, but maybe it's more for older kids. We all went on Crush's Coaster as my youngest daughter (aged 5) was over the height limit but it was a very fast rollercoaster with spinning cars that frightened her to death, I certainly wouldn't recommend for small kids even if they are over the height restriction. It was pretty scary even for adults.We had prebooked meals with characters at Cafe Mickey which was good and Auberge de Cendrillon which wasn't, and took rolls etc from the self service breakfast in the hotel for lunch, so only had one evening meal to find. We ate at a fast food restaurant near the Star Wars ride as it was the only one with a reasonable sized queue, I'd been expecting to have to pay in the region of 100 Euros having read some reviews on here but it cost 34 Euros for 4 of us including drinks and ice cream. Admittedly it wasn't very good but I think this is what you come to expect, Disneyland is brilliant except for the food.It cost about 3 E for a bottle of pop in the park, the same for a grab sized pack of crisps, and about 3.5E for an ice cream. But we didn't spend that much over our 4 days altogether.If you're having meals with characters, pre book them in the UK as it's cheaper. I would definitely recommend Disneyland, it was a wonderful experience for all of us, a very beautiful place and we can't wait to go back!",Disneyland_Paris
116634405,5,2011-8,United Kingdom,"The kids had a really fun time!!! Great for the young and young at heart! Staff are friendly and are multi lingual which ussually hepls.

116626844,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,"I read lots of the reviews on here before i went...some were good and some were bad, so for what it is worth here is mine. We went in the first two weeks of August with 2 adults and a boy aged 7I LOVE THIS PLACE...sure there are down parts, but the good out way those.I saw comments about the park being dirty....i saw tons of people walking around picking up litter and it is defiantly the cleanest place i have seen that has to accommodate that amount of people...so not dirty.Every toilet i went into was clean and had loo roll.The people....every single member of staff i spoke to was friendly , really helpful and most of them spoke English which really helped...the ones that didn't laughed and joked with us as we acted out or spoke in bad french....so no rude people.Food...Yep it is expensive....but you dont have to eat their food all the time. We went knowing that we were going to have a few special dinners and prepared ourself for the cost. There is a section at the beginning near the carpark that you can eat your own picnic. To be honest it was nice to go there and have a quiet picnic during the day, to re charge and just take a break from all the noise.It is located at the end of the moving escalators...if you get to the entrance to the park where they check your bags you have gone to far.Queues...yep they were long, but i am not sure what some people where expecting who complained about them....my tip, use the fast pass...queuing for an hour and a half for a 2 min ride is going to make anyone mad....fast pass and find something else to do while you wait.Parking....A LOT OF MONEY...  15 a day...we went for 4 days...with 2 adults and one child...we found it cheaper to buy a year long ticket as funnily it turned out cheaper.That way you dont have to pay for your parking.The parades............amazing.....grab your seat early as you cannot see anything if you are 4 rows behind people. If you have small children and are planning on staying for the late night show...you will not get out of the park until midnight....so tired children.Shops are very expensive...you cannot buy anything under   20 so be prepared for that in your budget.I have to say by day three i was fed up with the cheesy music and the signs everywhere that says 'we will make your dreams come true............but overall, an amazing place and we had a wonderful time.",Disneyland_Paris
116618726,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Now, before you go, realize this : Eurodisney will cost you money. I don't understand why people are surprised, complain and get annoyed about it, it is like any attraction   food and drink is expensive. If you want to save some money, drop into the ESSO petrol station before you go in (or go to it when you exit the car park, first exit on the right) and get water and snacks. Water for example is 2Euros70C in the park and costs 40C in the Esso station. Eitherway, this is the obvious problem with all theme parks. So, forgetting that fact, the park is great, seems a little crowded and average ride is a 45Min wait but that's the way it goes. There is plenty to see, fun to have and with the parades and guest appearances you will have loads of fun.The food there is good quality and expensive but a great place was the  Golden Nugget Saloon  which was a buffet restaurant and the quality was really really good and had a neat lay out to cope with busy times.We also ate at Planet Hollywood and in Toad House(!). I am not really into places like this but the kids loved it and I enjoyed watching them have fun.My only complaint is that people smoke everywhere, you can imagine that you have gone back to the 70s, seriously. Eurodisney, sort this out, zero tolerance, I like a few beers but I wouldn't walk into a place where kids go with a can of Stella, wake up!Parking is easy, all was good. Worth it? I guess so.",Disneyland_Paris
116616689,4,2011-7,France,"I was born inParis in the early 1970s and raised there, so this is the review of a true parisian on the Disneyland park in France. My first  encounter  with the disneyland was in 1990 when I was 17 and sent to California for a language trip to learn better English. I remember visiting Disneyland California and being incredibly impressed with 1) the rides, 2) the professionalism of it all and 3) the quality of the people and services. When  Euro  Disney opened back in 1992 (as it was called back then; it subsequently became  Disneyland Paris ), I was very enthusiastic and decided to visit the park immediately. I was not disappointed. Even if it was still small, the Disney magic had definitely been successfully exported; the sparkle was there I could tell. But then... a few years ago (it all started when the second park opened), I realized something had gone wrong with the magic. So, what can you expect   from my parisian perspective   in the Disneyland park in Paris? Well: if you are looking for a California or Florida type of experience, forget it. It's not there.  The rides are great at Disneyland Paris (I discussed with a few Americans and Brits who actually tell me they prefer some of the Paris attractions over those in CA or FL   for example Space Mountain   I don't; I simply love the genuine Space Mountain in CA or FL; so it is just a matter of taste).  However, the actual experience is not 100% fun. Why? Because not enough energy is put into making the park the  happiest place on earth . How? Simple yet unusual details for Disney:   shops: what on earth happened in the Disney shops??? Everything seems to be the same cheap stuff all over the place. Disney is known for its speciality shops (you'll definitely find many of these in FL). By specialty shops, I mean shops when you can purchase original Disney stuff, not just your regular Mickey T shirt.   food: oh my God! We are in a country which prides itself on serving good food. Disney serves food that   to me   is tasteless and SO expensive. I have tried many of their restaurants. The only nice place is actually oustide the Park at the Invention restaurant in the main Disney hotel where they have a decent buffet overlooking main street.    cleanliness: anyone who has ever visited Disney's toilets knows what I am talking about. I am revolted by the state of these toilets and ashamed for tourists.   service: yes, you will find Disney employees who are neither polite, nor kind, nor smiling in Paris, something which would rarely happen in CA or FL. I do not know if the staff is unhappy with their condition, but they certainly look unhappy and some of them are plainly rude and unprofessional with guests. I remember standing in line at a Disneyland ride and being told off by a Disney employee for having walked beyond a certain point (needless to say, no one had seen that  point ) in pretty agressive terms ( I did not tell you to keep walking , said the employee in a brisk manner without even saying hello or  sorry to have to mention this but it seems that...  I am paying to get scolded?). Their level of English is sometimes poor, at best.   disorganisation: even on peak days (like the heat of the summer) in CA or FL, everything runs smoothly in the overseas parks. In Paris, a simple glitch, such rain, creates a chaos and it takes hours to put the park back in motion. All in all, you are very likely to have an excellent day at Disneyland Paris but do manage your expectations; concentrate on the rides, they still are a lot of fun, not on the rest of it.",Disneyland_Paris

116492859,4,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Stayed at Newport Bay Hotel having travelled Eurostar. Train & booking in at Ebbsfleet all went well as did the parking at Ebbsfleet. At Eurodisney, you drop your cases in at a 'depot' and set off to Disneyland without a care. Your cases are actually delivered to your room. You book in to the hotel after your day in Disney   wonderful.We stayed 2 nights H B. You get about 21 euro credit at the restaurants per adult if you don't select from the set menu. We often had bits of set then 'extras' including alcoholic drinks and generally paid about 30 euro on top. Food is very good. The garlic bread in Mickeys cafe was the size and shape of a pizza! Consider going without a starter, especially if on a budget. You do get drinking cups for the children in Mickey's cafe & whilst there, the children met lots of characters. We took lots of drinks and snacks which was a good idea as the drinks (coke, water etc.) were around 2.50 euro each.Breakfast in the hotel was good really and you could bag a few rolls and various fillings at breakfast for your lunch! Work out your 'fastpass' so that you get on your favourite rides. I had no idea what rides to go on & we didn't plan properly. Finally,in the Steakhouse, the 48 hour steak (might be longer) was not great but the 'set' steak was great.",Disneyland_Paris

There is soooo much to do so wear comfy shoes as you will be walking a lot. The kids could have obviously stayed for days but we found that 3days was enough (kids aged 9,10). The rides for the bigger kids (adults) were good too with Space Mountain rating the best! The kids rated the StarTours ride the best going on that one 4times! So for kids that like Starwars that ride is for you..Some of the rides have fast pass options but don't leave that too late to arrange as they do cut their availability off at certain times of the day.

116433324,4,2011-7,United Kingdom,"Just back from a 4 day trip with a 3 year old and a 1 year old! We've done Orlando before and having read a few reviews on this site, I had somewhat lowered my expectations, however we all had a great time but probably due to doing some planning ahead... Kids had a great time and DLP is a great slice of Disney magic in Europe. Would I go again? Probably not as I think Orlando has more to offer and for a little extra you get so much more of the  magic  in Orlando. For a day or two, hard to beat DLP from the UK though... A few things to know before you go: 1) If coming on the Eurostar with luggage and strollers, make sure you can carry it (and your kids) yourself. Getting a trolley or any help at all at the French train station is impossible. This applies inbound and outbound. 2) Use the Disney Express service if coming by rail   at least you don't need to lug your bags to the hotel and you can go straight to the parks. They'll also deliver your bags to the train station on departure. Well worth it!3) Plan and book your meals in advance. Do some research and work out where you want to eat and ring the reservation number ( 33 1 60 30 40 50) before you leave and book your breakfasts and dinners... Cafe Mickey is great to meet the characters, and if you have little princesses, Auberge de Cendrillon is worth booking a dinner. By booking character meals you can also avoid queueing for the meet and greets in the parks, which can have hour long queues (although at least most of them have a semi workable queueing system in place now). We met some characters  let loose  in the Studio and it was mayhem as they got mobbed with no sense of an orderly queue! Aim to be early for breakfast (8am) and dinner (6pm). We told our kids  let's not wait here for Mickey, he's coming to breakfast with you tomorrow    they liked that and we could carry on and make the most of our day... Yes, this costs more money, but it does make for a more relaxed day knowing your little ones will actually get to meet the characters... don't guarantee them which ones though! You never know who'll be there! If you must queue for a particular character, be prepared for a long queue. Ask at the park entrance where and when they'll be there so you can plan to be there in advance. 4) Be assertive (not rude) with the  pushy crowd    don't get pushed out of the queues or be pushed aside waiting to meet characters. Be firm and polite. Might be helped by my build, but a firm  No, can you please wait your turn?  stopped most pushy people in their tracks! 5) Be prepared to ask, firmly, for smokers in queues to put out their cigarettes. We found every single person apologised and did so immediately when we pointed to our children and asked politely. It was quite disappointing to find so many people smoking, but there is zero enforcement so somewhat expected I suppose. 6) Don't expect the American  Disney Smile  here (but, hey, it's not the US)   plan your visit yourself, know what you want to see, give yourself time to enjoy yourself, take a map and download the free iPhone App to show you waiting times whilst in the parks (although watch your roaming charges!) We found most CMs we spoke to pleasant and accommodating   you should probably try to speak a little French (and I know about 5 phrases only) and slow down... Speaking louder doesn't help understanding (something lost on a large number of UK US visitors we heard..).7) Take lunch with you! Make up some rolls at breakfast and take them into the park. You can take your own food and drink in (just don't take a giant picnic basket and expect to be able to lay out on the grass!)... A few sandwiches and drinks are fine! Don't believe the posts that you can't take it in   they are NOT searching your bags for food and drink. And Orlando is exactly the same in terms of bag searching... 8) Queues for rides start to disappear from about 9:00pm onwards in DLP, and from 6:00pm in SP.9) Use FastPass where available. Really no reason not to... hardly any queueing and you know what time you need to be at the ride. Simples.We had a great time and the kids loved the Disney magic. Yes, people smoked everywhere. Yes, queues were long. Yes, it's expensive. Still, it is Disneyland and it is wonderful! However, if you ask politely for people to stop smoking in queues, hold your ground in a queue if someone gets pushy (happened twice to us in 4 days), be prepared to spend some money to get to meet some characters over breakfast or dinner and smile it all off, you might just find it's a wonderful place to be... Just know you won't be able to do everything in a day and you'll have a great time... As we left on our final day, we ran into Mickey who was all on his own just around a corner from the exit. No queue, no people mobbing him (they hadn't noticed him yet!) and a moment of magic for my two little girls who got a private farewell from Mickey Mouse... This made my holiday.. the little unexpected things that make a holiday magical and something that might just happen if you just believe... :)",Disneyland_Paris
116404097,5,2011-7,United States,"3 parks down, only Japan to go! This is our 3rd Disneypark that we've visited having been numerous times to Orlando and twice to California's park. My wife and I took our 18 year old daughter and 9 year old son. They both loved all the attractions. The attraction here comprises 2 parks: Disneyland Park and Hollywood Studios. Each park has similar attractions as their US counterparts. Disneyland Park has Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear's ride, Pirates of the Caribbean, Big Thunder Railroad but no Splash Mountain(boo!). Hollywood Studios has some of the same rides as well: Tower of Terror, Rock n' Roller Coaster, etc. Both have some different attractions as well.Unfortunately we only had one day to spend here so we didn't have a chance to do all the rides. There were a LOT of people here, but then, much of Europe has their vacation times right now. There is also an area called Disney Village, more of a shopping district that sounds like a scaled down Downtown Disney a la Orlando that we didn't have time to go to.We used the train to get here, but be warned: While the Metro ticket will allow you through the turnstiles to get on this train, you need to buy a different ticket to get out to the park. I saw signs saying that the train to the airport cost extra, but nowhere did we see anything about Disney. When we got there we had to go through another turnstile which didn't open with our tickets. Uh oh. An attendant told us (in Frenglish) that we had violated the train system and were liable for a 100 euro fine (4 x 25). However, he took pity on us and reduced the fine to 50 euros total for the 4 of us. It was not a good way to start the day. If you are planning on taking the train, see this Wiki article http:  wikitravel.org en Disneyland Resort Paris. I guess I should've read it before we went, but this day was a spur of the moment decision. My daughter decided a couple of days before that this was where she would like to celebrate her 18th birthday!By the way, if you haven't already done so, you might want to buy your return train ticket when you arrive at the park, as the line can be very long in the evening. Be prepared for a crowded train ride back to Paris. Many people, including us, had to stand the entire trip (about 35 minutes). All in all, another great day at Disney! I heard that they have some good deals on hotel park combos during June and September, so next time we'll probably look into that.",Disneyland_Paris
116357772,2,2011-6,United States,"I have visited DisneyWorld in Florida numerous times, Dineyland in California, and this summer I took my niece to Disney Paris. The rides were all a little tired, the lines as usual for summer travel, but I was not expecting grown people to cut in front of you, push past, and try to get to the front of the line. The flower beds outside the entrance had weeds growing in them. I have never seen this in any Disney area anywhere. On several occasions I wish I had a tub of baby wipes, and hand sanitizers. If you can afford it, hold out for DisneyWorld in Florida.",Disneyland_Paris
116354923,4,2011-7,Egypt,"It was so much fun, tried to play all the attractions but couldn't ... lines were endless; even though it was not even a weekend. Visited the second park too   Disney Studios   also very nice. Recommended time to spend: 2 days... 1 day too short, 3 days will be boring.",Disneyland_Paris
116354203,5,2011-8,United Kingdom,"This is our second time at Disneyland paris. My husband and I and our two children aged 6 and 2 had a great time on both occasions. We found the staff really helpfull and very good with the children. At one point our two year old was having a temper tantrum and a staff member was walking past. He came over and spoke to her so nicely and said she was a little princess and calmed her right down. The rides are excellent and there is a good selection for all ages so you can have fun as an adult as well. Fastpasses are really useful   The babyswitch is excellent and you can walk straight on to most rides. Some queues can be long, but some rides also have a single rider que (particularly in the Toy Story section of the Disney Studios)The shows are good too   would recommend Stitch Live   really funny for adults as well as children. Animagique is good for children and the Cinimagique is really clever (ok for children but more aimed at adults who recognise the films)It is quite a walk around so a pushchair is a must for little ones. It is better to spend a day in the disneyland park and another in disney studios to avoid walking back and forth between parks.Some rides are quiet at certain times of the day. Both time we have been we have not had to queue for Space mountain and the que for Indiana Jones was only 15 minutes.Food is expensive in the park, but you can buy snacks from the shop near the station. We have never been refused entry for having food and drinks in bags or at the bottom of the pushchair.Some of the resturants are buffet style and these are good as you can have as much as you like and there is a good selection. Best to book in advance as places can get busy. You can phone before you go, book at the Disney Town hall or at any of the resturants. Plaza gardens is quite good.You can eat within the Piriates of the Carribean ride in the Blue Lagoon. It is a strange atmosphere and quite entertaining. The menu is limited if you have half board meal vouchers though.It is busy but generally the parks are kept clean   having gone in to disneyland park early with the extra hours we have seen staff polishing the bins.With the amount of people there it can get conjested   using the arcades at the sides can be a quicker route through if you want to avoid the crowds a bit. The queues can be frustrating and it is true that some nationalities seem to be unaware of how to que fairly. It is amusing to see the British people trying to maintain the rules of a good que. After a while you realise no one actually wants to annoy you, they just don't see it as wrong.What is wrong without a doubt is the smoking. There is so much of it despite there being allocated areas for smokers. No staff challenge people smoking and in particular people smoking in the queues where you cannot move away from the smoke. It is terrible that a place mainly for children allows people to smoke. It really should be banned.Generally however, we have really enjoyed both visits and have made good use of our time there. It is magical for children, but also for adults who have a little bit of an imagination and are young at heart.",Disneyland_Paris
116320033,3,2011-8,United Kingdom,"Some fantastic rides (Space Mountain was brilliant), but the organisation is a long way short of what you would find in Orlando. Don't trust the published queue times...we found them very innaccurate. Also, the end of evening parade lines were moved immediately after to allow the fireworks to happen...the resultant crowd throng was uncomfortable to say the least. Sadly they just haven't got the organisation as good as Orlando...and the staff didn't have the Disney magic about them. Also, the toilets and general cleanliness were not up to Disnet standards.",Disneyland_Paris
116314595,5,2011-8,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from a stay at Disneyland Paris. We selected to stay at their Hotel Cheyenne which proved to to perfect for the six year old with us. He enjoyed Jessie James Bunk House on East Desperado Street and loved getting his own buffet breakfast. Staff helpful, room clean and perfect with bunk beds, stetson mirror and disney channels. We transfered from CDG airport using ezyshuttle.com and cannot recommend it enough. Service was excellent, they were there at the airport when we came through arrivals and our return journey could have given us problems due to a blockade but John got us back to the airport in good time for our flight.

116313053,3,2011-7,United States,"We were visiting family in Germany and my husband surprised me and our son (6 yrs.) with a 4 days trip to Disneyland Paris. We were very excited as we are big Disney fans.This was our first time ever staying at a Disney Resort Hotel  a good experience.We stayed at the Sequioa Lodge which was perfect for us. (Great staff and location!)What was not so good? Simply put, the  Magic  seemed missing. The rides were fantastic (Get Fast Passes when possible), but the pushing and shoving is what got me. Forget about the idea of making a proper line to get an autograph and picture with a character. Parents shove their kids to the front and they follow. (lines for characters in the hotels and for Sully   Buzz DID have proper lines!) Get used to fighting your way through. Smoking   there are  smoking areas , but NO ONE cares. People light up all over the place and no  cast member  ever says anything. The Dollar   Euro exchange rate is not good, so that is why everything was SO expensive in our eyes. All that was done was take the dollar price and put a Euro symbol in front of it, e.g. $14.95 for a Jedi Mickey in Florida cost 14.95 Euros (about $22.00)But again, the  magic  was missing   the pride in keeping things up, the friendly faces   not there.Am I glad we went? Yes. Will I ever really want to go back? No. If you have the chance, save up and experience Florida.",Disneyland_Paris

The park is smaller than Disney World in FL but still has all of the same rides so it was nice not having to walk forever between the attractions. Food of course was over priced. We ate 1 big meal while we where there Pizza Panet. The food was ok. It was all you can eat pizza, salad, pasta, and dessert. But the best part was ALL YOU CAN Drink!!! Cokes are soooo expensive in Paris anyway but extra expensive in the park. So this is a major plus!!! The cost was about 10 euros per person. They have air conditioning and clean bathrooms. There is also a play area for the little ones!!!! Keep your water bottles and fill them up at the numerous water fountains in the park. We saw lots of people doing this.",Disneyland_Paris
116249305,5,2011-7,United Kingdom,"We have just had a fantastic time at DLP with our 5 and 6 year olds. On previous visits to Disney in the US, the temptation has been to route march around the park to try and see all the attractions as quickly as possible . We have put off visiting Disney with the children for that reason but actually, they neither needed nor wanted to see all of it. Most of the big queues (e.g. Space Mountain) are for the rides that are inappropriate for them anyway.We stayed in a Disney hotel close to the park which was a good choice as it enabled us to come and go as we pleased, depending on how tired the children were. The extra magic hours meant they could do all the rides they wanted to, first thing in the morning. Back to the hotel for breakfast and to meet some of the characters in the foyer (don't, don't, don't join the long queues in the park   even if you are not staying in a Disney hotel you can call into the hotel foyer areas to meet the characters). Our children then slept in the afternoon and went out again at night for the parades and fireworks. With hindsight, I wish we had taken them sooner.It is well worth planning the trip in advance although it is surprisingly difficult to get hold of the free site map that is given out in the park in advance. Generally, we got a fast pass for one ride and then queued for another which meant you could do two rides in fairly quick succession. The longest we had to queue was 50mins for the Toy Soldier Parachute Drop but it was worth it; despite my reservations, even our 5 year old loved it. Peter Pan, Buzz Lightyear and Slinky Dog were other favourites and there was no queue for It's a Wonderful Life (a boat ride through singing characters from around the world) which all the children loved. Pirates of the Caribbean is a good attraction: another boat ride through an underwater cave like tunnel but it unsettled our two children and they asked never to be taken on anything like that ever again(!). It's not a scary ride by any means but is probably more suitable for slightly older or more robust children   it's often hard to tell until it's too late. Other people have said similar things about the witch on the Snow White ride but ours were unfazed by that. Still, you have to make a judgment call on the day and ours have stopped having nightmares about it now. I expected them to dislike Star Tours (a kind of Star Wars simulator ride) but they loved it.The highlight for us, and a definite must do for any little girl with a princess fixation, was the Princess lunch (or dinner) at Auberge de Cendrillon. This is an expensive meal but the food is excellent and it is cheaper to book in advance. Our 5 year old daughter absolutely adored it. Whilst DLP is not a cheap holiday, we had a great time and will almost certainly go back again. I thought the extra cost of staying in one of the Disney hotels was definitely worthwhile. In this instance, I'm sure it's worth spending the extra money and having shorter or less frequent holidays than trying to do it on a budget. In the park, there are no cheap restaurants as such and those at the cheaper end were overcrowded and busy, offering what looked like fairly poor value.Disney Village (just outside the Park) has more choice and there is also a McDonalds and the Earl of Sandwich selling very nice, reasonably priced toasted paninis on a terrace overlooking the lake. There is also a small supermarket in the train station which sells sandwiches, pasta, drinks and snacks. Be warned though, you aren't allowed to take any food or drink into either the park or Disney village (the station sits between the two). Scary security staff search you and in our case, we were made to take a 2 mile detour around the back of the village to get back to our hotel because we had bought a bottle of wine at the station (at a tenth of the price charged in the hotel)!!We paid for the half board dining plan and pre booked our meals, whether it represents overall good value for money really depends on where you choose to eat. It is definitely a good idea to make advance bookings to avoid queues (there are enough of those in the park itself) and the hotel concierge will do this willingly. If you want to do the Princess lunch and the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show (not on Weds or Thursdays) then it is worth the premium package but otherwise, it definitely isn't. There are two cheaper packages though and prepaying any of them means that you can forget the cost and just get on with enjoying a great family holiday without the gritted teeth....at least until your credit card bill arrives.",Disneyland_Paris
116207984,4,2011-7,United Kingdom,"You have to enjoy the Disney experience its very professional, almost seamless as you wonder around the two parks. As we were staying in a Disney Resort Hotel we had the advantages of being within 10 minutes walking distance to the park.The scale of the park is probably the first thing to hit you with Disney Studios and the theme park we easily filled our three days. Making use of the Fast Track passes took us a little while to work out. Certain rides have a timed booking system available where you can turn up and put your tickets through a ticket machine that issues you another ticket with a time slot later in the day for the most popular rides this can be 3 or 4 hours in advance or an hour. You can only have one fast track pass alive at a time but when the FT time has passed you can then book another one. Some of the bigger rides don't have these (yet).Eating and drinking in the park is expensive and it is well worth taking drinks and snacks with you ( having then gone on to central Paris prices are about the same) There is a Mcdonalds in the food gallery outside the park which is always busy and is also probably the only one in France not allowed to serve beer.A filled Baguette is between 6 and 7 Euro add a drink at E 2.65 means a lunch of at least 10 Euro each which lets face it at the moment is nearly 10 quid each.If you have the luxury of a three day pass you can spend your time moving between the events in the studios and rides on the theme park. A big hit was the stunt car show which was truly dramatic and exciting. The back lot tram ride was a surprising hit and well recommended by my young children. The kids also enjoyed the small shows that go on all the time such as Stitch live and parents enjoyed the opportunity to sit down.Thunder Mountain is still difficult to beat as ride and the Space Mountain 2 ride is not as good as the previous one (jerky and not smooth). The parades are a must and children have the opportunity of joining in and dancing at prepared moments along the route and people are aware of this and start taking up position at least an hour before in the main park. The night show with fireworks is also very spectacular and very enjoyable but completely exhausting a 12 hour day in park is fun but hard work.While it is often a target of some ridicule for being the ultimate in cute it is difficult to see how anybody can do it better.",Disneyland_Paris
116200799,4,2010-9,Switzerland,"A  must , visiting Disneyland Paris is like going back to our childhood, the place is fantastic and you can have a lot of fun,My suggestion is try to avoid Sundays or bank holidays because the place can become very crowded and you can loose a lot of time queueing for an attraction.",Disneyland_Paris

116126210,5,2011-7,United States,"Disneyland Paris was a lot of fun. It was set up very similar to Disney World in Orlando, but there were some noticeable differences. Disney has done a good job replicating the various  lands  in the park. Many of the rides have the same name as the rides at Disney World but the rides themselves are very different. Personally, I think Space Mountain at Disneyland Paris was better than its counterpart in Florida. Overall, I would say that if you are in France and have children or just want to have a day of fun, it is worth the trip to Disneyland Paris. Getting to the park is really easy and not too expensive either. You just take the RER A line to Marne La Valle and the park is right at the exit.",Disneyland_Paris
116093373,4,2010-11,United States,"Disneyland in France is a great day trip! You can see the entire park in a day but if you want to do it leisurly and ride every ride, you should make it at least two. I would not recommend going on Halloween. We've been to the Disneyland in France several times and the first time was on a Halloween and the park was so crowded we only got to ride on four rides the entire day. Even with fast passes, the lines were over an hour long. When we went the following year, the week after Halloween, the lines were not long and we often did not need a fast pass. The food is very expensive (I know, normal for theme parks). If you are traveling with someone who does not do a lot of walking, there is a train tram that can take you through the park.",Disneyland_Paris
116082291,3,2011-7,United Kingdom,"This was my 2nd visit and have also visited Florida. We previously visited slightly out of season and I wish we hadn't booked at peak season. The parks are a very different experience when you are queuing for everything   it ruins the experience and even walking through the parks becomes a struggle. You have to queue to use the toilets and they were not pleasant, during the 4 days we never saw any cleaning staff!! Staffing levels felt low on most rides so everything feels as if it moves at a slow pace and there is certainly no Disney welcome, if anything it's the opposite   one 'cast member' was even yelling at someone on a ride. As others reviewers found the Uk Euro exchange rate makes everything very, very expensive so it can feel like you've paid 5star prices for a 2star experience. Not sure if we would return   think the magic spell was broken as your optimistic is broken by the constant queues. We stayed on the parks so supposedly had earlier access but that made no difference, we even tried to go later but again no difference. We gave up on some of the rides   just not worth the wait and fast pass isn't available on enough rides.",Disneyland_Paris
116071549,3,2011-7,United States,"Being an avid fan of all things Disney, I knew when we booked our honeymoon to Paris that I simply could not go without spending a day at Disneyland Paris. Having gone to Walt Disney World in Florida nearly every year, I became very accustomed to the extremely high level of quality that WDW provides in terms of entertainment, dining, cleanliness, customer service, etc. Essentially, WDW is the ultimate vacation destination. I had hoped that DLP would be equally as high quality. I was right...and wrong. The rides at DLP are unparalleled and just as good as WDW. In fact, Space Mountain Mission 2 at DLP is much scarier and more intense than Space Mountain at WDW. Phantom Manor at DLP is just as great as the Haunted Mansion in WDW. Plus, there are rides at DLP that WDW does not have, such as Crush's Coaster and Indiana Jones. These rides were really fun. Plus, the design of the park and the buildings were just as beautiful as WDW. But, the parallels stop there. In every other aspect, WDW blows away DLP. For one thing, the landscaping in WDW is so much better kept. I'm not sure if that's b c WDW is in a tropical area, whereas DLP is in northern France? In addition, WDW seems to be kept up more in general (ie  DLP has buildings with chipped paint and sidewalks with chunks missing). Also, DLP is much dirtier. Not that I would label it as a  dirty park  necessarily (it is much cleaner than most amusement parks), but I am used to the spotless WDW. DLP has cigarette butts and trash and plastic bottles lying around. Again, not alot, but just enough to make it not quite as magical as WDW. In general, it seemed there were way fewer employees working at DLP. I'm not sure if that's b c DLP is facing budget issues, or if the French are higher paid than the American employees, but either way, there were WAY less people working. Less people working   more dirty. The bathrooms were particularly dirty... my husband joked that in one men's bathroom the only way they could clean it would be to burn it to the ground and build a new one. In addition, the employees of DLP didn't seem to have that Disney sparkle. (Big smile, always accommodating, customer first attitude...) It's not that they were rude necessarily, but they seemed lazy and inefficient. At one counter service restaurant, it took me 30 minutes to get a fast food meal. And, I saw employees in the back just chatting away and texting on cell phones. That really is inexcusable. Also, the smoking is out of control. I know it's a cultural thing, but can't there be specified smoking areas? It's just gross. It's hard to have a magical experience when someone is puffing away next to you in line. Perhaps the thing that bothered me the most was at the end of the day when I wanted to visit the gift shops and pick up a few souvenirs. In WDW, the shops on Main Street stay open at least one hour AFTER the fireworks. In DLP, the shops were trying to close an hour BEFORE the fireworks. In fact, half of the park itself was closed an hour before the fireworks! And this is in peak season! At this shop, I went to 3 employees, each of whom sent me to someone else.  Sorry, this register is closed . Huh?? Do you NOT want people to purchase souvenirs? Then, as I stood patiently in line waiting my turn for the ONE available cashier, she would take random people butting in line from the side. Is there some secret code I don't know about that you don't have to wait in line?? In fact, I found this ALL over Paris. We would wait in line patiently, and some French person would come from the side and the cashier would help them first! I'm probably being paranoid, but it really felt like I was being discriminated against for being American. Then came the fireworks show that I waited all day for. They were nice, but a little unspectacular. They were very short and there was no finale! How can you have a fireworks show with no finale? All in all, the day was pretty average. Perhaps DLP is facing cutbacks due to the economy? Either way, it was a little disappointing.",Disneyland_Paris
116024771,4,2011-7,United Kingdom,This is my third visit to Disneyland Paris and I still love it. Although its not as good as Florida its still brilliant fun and escapism. I do think the ticket prices have climbed too high now and if you go in the holiday period it is too crowded. We bought our tickets cheaper on the web before we left so we could just walk straight in. The lines for popular rides can be over an hour. The castle is a highlight and make sure you stay for the fireworks and watch the parades. The only let down is the food which is mostly very expensive fast food of an average quality.,Disneyland_Paris
116013807,3,2011-7,Slovenia,"We returned from a 3 days trip to Eurodisneyland..We wanted to celebrated the birthday of our daughter (2 years old) a big fan of Mickey and Minnie... What shall I say? If one does not have big expectations and has time everything is great! We went there to relax...we did not rush to anything and took everything slowly..but even in this way, the organisation is sooo bad!..that is a waste of time...For everything there is a waiting time which, in our opinion, as we waited for some of the attractions may be much cut...the attractions are not something special and the time that one spends in the attraction depends on the mood of the driver..For exemple, we waited 30 minutes for the Lancelot....horse ride and even for the previous rides there were 6 rounds for us was just one ...and everybody was just amazed and that is it...we wanted to complained and they promised some special treatement but we were not there for this.. Peter Pan and Pinocchio are ridiculous fast and boring...A small world is nice...We went for lunch at Caffe Mickey which is great for children..each character spent time at each table...we saw Mickey, Pluto, the dorf from Peter Pan...it was great atmosphere..We made a reservation, and it is pricey (we spent 115 for 2 adults and 3 children menus 18 per child), but hey! That is Disneyland!Everything is pricey and I would rather prefer to buy some items from a Disney store than from Disneyland..since they have all the same items..The great thing for children was Club House live (in WD Parc) I would strongly recommend this!! It is a great show and everybody feels that is at Disneyland!It is also strongly recommend not to miss the Parade..that is great and the children will love it!!Other than that..the prices are ridiculous expensive for what they offer..so I would recommend to check alternatives..we bought vouchers from ebay which gave us access to the parc with 25 euro each instead of 57. My husband has now an Annual pass and then we could buy a ticket with 22 Euro instead of 60 for 2 parks and the parking is free.. So I would recommend to make some homework before...since it is really a pity to pay so much for such a poor enterteinement.. and after all, we all pay a lot for the trip (besides the French). We went with a mobilehome and was great because one can parc 10 minutes away and have a break during the day with the babies and go back in the afternoon..otherwise I believe it is very tiring...All in all, have fun if you go but lower the expectations...maybe you can enjoy better!!",Disneyland_Paris

115968607,2,2011-7,Ireland,"Our 3rd visit to Disneyland Paris (just for a day) was the most disappointing one of all. We arrived one hour before official opening time, and when they did eventually let us in, the park was under construction in many areas, with several of the rides (Indiana Jones and Aladdin for example) closed. Big Thunder railroad was also  broken  when we tried to use it, but it eventually opened around noon. I really don't know why they can't do heavy maintenance or redesign work in winter instead of during peak times.My family and I are big Disney fans, but I'm not sure what's going on with this park any more. Cast members are surlier and more unhelpful than ever, food is a total rip off and customer service is something that's only written somewhere in an employee handbook, because it's certainly not being practiced.Magical?   definitely not as far as I am concerned, but maybe they were just having a bad day when we called......",Disneyland_Paris

115954176,4,2010-8,United Kingdom,"Aug2010We went to Disneyland Paris for 2 days, we stayed off site.( If i had gone with my family, we had stayed on site)My friends had never been to a large themepark, or abroad before.The kids faces going,through the gates was a picture.thet didnt know what to do first. we spilt into two groups, the younger kids went on the smaller rides, magic kingdom. etc. the only down fall was the queues, they hadnt had to queue in most Uk theme parks. I explained that there was guides for both walt disney studios and disneyland. The other party didnt understand the timetable for shows, this can be difficult to explain, cast members are availible around the park, they wear badges for what langugage they speak. when it is hot, there are cool staged show to get away from the heat and crowds. that is why i would stay on site, you can go back to you hotel, for sleep swim, if they have a pool. A lot of hotels have, extra hours for hotel gusets, they can get in the park early, and have breakfast, or last after most guest have gone.There is a lot to see and do, you need at least 3 days to see and do everything.I would start at the end of the park, get the train at main street and get to the end of the park. Use the fastpass ticket system, on the major rides, tower of terror at walt disney studios, and peter pan ride at magic kingdom, they get very busy, get the tickets asap, you get a time to revisit the ride and use the fastpass lines.There are so many shows during the day, you need to plan your days, the disney shows are incredible, not be missed The motor stunts show in walt disney studios is on 3 times a day you need to check the daily boards and timetables, when entering each park.Food and drink is exspensive, tip is to take a bottle of water in to the park. Yon can refil at water fountains !!!! no food can be taken in. You can buy a sandwich at the train station,if you come out of the park. Disney village near the train staion is cheaper, then the park. You will be search, when going in to the parks  every bag,you have including buggies.If you stay on site you can fill up on breakfast, and pre order half board packages, which can save a fortune.During the day there is some much to do and see, dont miss the parades, each land and area has one. The major one is near the main street and castle, the crowd are asked to join in, dancing and singing, to all your favourite disney icons. I have used a book to help with Brit tips, its the Brits guide to disneyland paris, worth its money. I took the book with me for help getting around, and there is a 10% discount when you show the book at shops and cafes.Because we were spilt into two groups, me and my family knew our way around the park, its like the florida one but on a smaller scale.The castle is the main feature, is still jaw dropping, everytime we go to France or Orlando.cast members are around to answer any questions, if they dont know they will find out.The only two downsides to Disneyland paris is the queues and expensive foods.I am considering visiting soon, but staying on site. when you stay on site, you get the extra value of early morning breakfast in the theme park, extra hours and somewhere to escape the heat  wet weather at your hotel.Not to be missed theme park. worth a visit. !!!!",Disneyland_Paris
115950861,4,2011-7,Norway,"We bought a 3 day ticket online. Afterwards we discovered that an annual card (classic) would have been a better bargain    (has to be bought minimum 3 days before your first visit). We also noticed that parking costs 15 Euros, while parking at Disney village right next to it costs 8 Euros. Food inside DL is very expensive, so bring sandwiches and water bottles etc. For young children Disneyland is great, though there are a few things they   re not allowed to do. Disney Studios were not too interesting for our kids (all below 10). If you just have 1 day, don   t bother buying a two park ticket, but concentrate on Disneyland.",Disneyland_Paris
115930693,2,2011-7,United Kingdom,"DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO DISNEY PARIS DURING PEAK SEASON!!! Please listen to this advice as you will be incredibly disappointed if you don't! The crowds are so vast that even if you hold your child's hand it is possible at times that they will be dragged away and lost. The best rides aimed at 6 year olds have queue times of between 60 90 mins and NO FAST PASS. You will simply not be able to ride on the best, most exciting rides unless you are willing to endure the wait with your little one. You will not get to have a picture with Mickey or Minnie even if you see them unless you are incredibly lucky. They get mobbed and have to have several minders who regularly drag them away behind the scenes as the costumes were getting damaged and abused. (We ended up having to queue for 30 mins just to get a picture!)Unless you have breakfast at 7am you are unlikely to get a table at breakfast at your hotel without queuing for 5 10 mins.The auditoriums for shows fill up incredibly fast with people queuing for 30 45 mins before to get the best seats. If you don't queue your kids will most likely get stuck behind adults and have a restricted view. This happened to us EVERY TIME. The best views of the parade in Disneyand Park again fill up very quickly and unless you secure your spot by quite simply sitting on the edge of the path for 45 mins your kids will not be able to see much.OVERALL.... peak season tickets are a huge waste of money and you will end up exhausted and frustrated. Yes our kids had a great time but it could have been far more exciting if we had gone when the crowds were much smaller. Only go to Disney during peak season if you are willing to queue for EVERYTHING.Oh and disregarding the time of year be prepared for everything costing DOUBLE. This morning a very small slice of cheese pizza cost us around   5... YES   5!!!!!!!If you have the money and children who can withstand a longer flight please visit Disneyland Florida. I have been to both and Paris is a pathetic and overpriced comparison!!!TIPS:Bring sandwhich bags. There is bread, butter, ham and cheese available at breakfast. Make the sandwhiches at the table and slip them into your sandwhich bag (within a backpack  large bag) when no one is looking. It will save you loads of money.Ask for a kettle from reception and take the coffee and sugar from breakfast. Fill up a clean baby bottle with milk and store it in your room in cold water. Coffee costs around   4   5. This will save you loads.Buy treats  sweets for the kids before you go and pack in your suitcase. Buy large bottles of water and pack a bottle of squash. Put it all in a backpack.All the kids TV is in French (Playhouse Disney.....). If you can buy a portable DVD player (great for the Eurostar too!) and bring the lead to connect it to the TV. The TVs in our hotel were brand new LCD and have all the connections. We got an 8 inch LG with a six hour battery. Most have a 2 hour battery... choose wisely!Stay at the Sequioia Lodge. It is the best 'budget' hotel set in a pretty and tranquil forrest. Very close to Disney Village and easy to walk. It is the only budget hotel with a swimming pool.Hotel guests can enter the park at 9am so if you can get up earlier you have an hour before the park officially opens. (makes no difference during peak times really as there are so many Disney guests!)Visit Mickey's cafe. The food is overpriced and not that nice but the Disney characters are awesome and this experience made our holiday amazing for the kids. BOOK THIS EARLY WITH YOUR HOTEL CONCIERGE. Queue times can exceed 45mins for a table otherwise.If you have a buggy get a bicycle chain and padlock. You will have to leave your buggy at the railings of many, many rides and so many look the same yours may very well get stolen! Pack waterproof clothing. The heavens opened today and pathetic and flimsy ponchos cost   10 each!!!Get your Euros put on a debit style card from Thomas Cook. It is widely accepted and saves loose change being lost on rides.Plan, plan, plan ahead. Do your research and ask staff for advice. it will save time and enable you to do more.",Disneyland_Paris
115906293,3,2011-7,United Kingdom,"Me, my wife and two small children visited in July 2011. On the last day my wife had her purse stolen by pickpockets. Money and four disney passes were stolen. We then tried to report this to the Disney land security... but there was none. Instead they directed us to 'lost and found'? who then told us that we had to go to the police station a mile away. That was it.... We assumed they would want to know about the crime so they could invalidate the passes, which could be sold on? but nope... not a lot they could do.Once in the police station, there was a spanish couple who also had been targeted, and another british couple who were very VERY upset. Be very aware when taking your purse out because there is a chance that pickpockets are watching and following you. It left a very sour taste in the mouth. The only good point, was that out passports were not taken.",Disneyland_Paris
115906215,3,2011-7,United Kingdom,"Arrived around 12pm, had issues getting in because of my BOGOF ticket with Expedia   my fault for not printing off, but after this me and my friend ran off and got excited by the Disney castle thing. With us both being 21, we headed for the rides suited to older people: Space Mountain, Terror Tower and the Aerosmith one. Space Mountain had an estimated queue time of 90 minutes. Went by fine, two kids kept trying to push in   so with the help of other guests we managed to block them out    . The ride was exhilarating and fun   enjoyed it a lot. Also enjoyed Terror Tower lots   queue time of around 45 minutes. (Queue times based on the displays, didn't actually time it myself)Aerosmith ride didn't have an expected Q time, but it felt like AGES. LONG. The ride was okay, but there was no thrill, just a lot of head bumping. Indiana Jones was fun  went towards the end of the day   queue was around 15 mins. Saw 3 parades   all very entertaining. Had no idea when the characters were available to have photos taken with, but we managed to spot some by chance. So difficult to get photos with them, we managed one with Remy? from Rataouille   even that was hard!We had a park hopper and after space mountain, we headed to the studios because they closed at 7pm. We didn't take advantage of the fast pass, didn't realise it was free but it seemed that the ride we were queueing for had run out anyway.Lots of waiting for us   even though I've become so accustomed to queueing   I'd hate to think how young kids would cope. Probably would recommend spreading the visit over several days   or deciding what rides you want to go to beforehand.",Disneyland_Paris
115897708,5,2010-10,United States,"My husband and I spent a day at the park and had a very nice visit. Since we went in October, it wasn't crowded, but the weather was cool and there were a few attractions closed at the time. (Both of those negatives are absolutely worth smaller crowds in my opinion, though! Plus we got to see the Halloween decorations.) As someone who has also been to the parks in Florida and California many times, I must say that I LOVED the Disneyland Paris versions of Space Mountain and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad    they were really different from the Disneyland and Disney World versions in great ways. It was also really neat to see all the other attractions that I had grown up loving with a European twist. As a side note, if you have spent a lot of time in the American parks, don't go into the visit expecting things to be really similar to what you're used to. The little differences can be what makes it an even better experience!",Disneyland_Paris
115889581,2,2011-7,United Kingdom,"Travelled with daughter and husband and grand children aged 2 and 5 for a 5 night stay at the Sequoia Lodge Hotel.The adjoining rooms in the south wing were recently refurbished and were clean and comfortable. Rooms now have free security boxes and a mini bar, be careful as the items in the mini bar are sensored so if you remove an item to look at you will be automatically billed eg 10 euro for a minature vodka.The hotel staff were polite and generally helpful so did not experience any of the incidents of sullen unsmiling staff reported by other reviewers.One restaurant was closed so we were given vouchers for breakfast at alternative venues in the park, not a good idea as we booked the 7.30 slot to take advantage of the 2 hour guest only admission, the walk to the alternative venues was about 30 to 40 minutes so it ended being a pointless exercise and we returned to the hotel and bluffed our way into breakfast.HEAVEN   The grandchildren were enthralled from the momemt we walked through the gates to leaving for the airport. The layout is the same as Disney Florida with the same atmosphere if you are a toddler. If you are an adult however the atmosphere is more like down town Beiruit!!! The French in particular but generally anyone who is not English have one point of view, that is I have paid so I can do what I like when I like to who I like. be prepared to wait in line and have idiots push, elbow and lean on you despite holding a 2 year old to gain 2 feet of progress. In one line a french woman even sprayed aerosol deoderant at head height catching my wife in the face so she could make room for her entourage of gibbering cretins!Having through work had safety responsibility for crowds of over 100 000 the place itself is an accident waiting to happen and they did, like the man who had climbed a fence to stand on a feature garden hill to watch a parade in total darkness who was pushed and fell down the hill into thorn bushes. There is a totally insufficent number of staff to control the huge crowds that develop when these parades take place coupled with the me me me attitude that injuries will happen.Strollers for the kids were cheap at 8.99 euros for the day, if you move parks simply leave the stroller at the pick up remove your I.D slip and take it with your receipt to the pick up at the next park.Food was expensive for what it was, approx 120 to 150 euro tfor 4 adult burger meals and 2 childrens 'happy' type meals.Having been to Disney Florida 4 times in nearly 20 years I would say to anyone thinking of experiencing Disney save that little extra, look for the deals and consider staying off the Disney site and take the kids to a far happier and relaxing place.",Disneyland_Paris
115875124,2,2011-7,United Kingdom,"I took my 5 year old for 4 days and he was very disappointed with the whole experience to say the least. Horrific waiting times of sometimes 90 minutes  ensured that the fast pass system was the only reasonable way to get onto rides without waiting a silly amount of time . Unfortunately not all rides have the fast pass system which resulted in a 2 hour wait for the finding nemo ride.Queue jumping is also rife on some rides and the staff seemed reluctant to do anything about it despite witnessing it first hand..We stayed in the hotel sante fe which despite being sold as a cars themed hotel seemed like some run down $10 motel with a few cars duvets thrown in to me. The inclusive breakfeast time was like a feeding free for all at the zoo with a poor selection of ham, cheese and tinned fruit to choose from. And again the pushing and queue jumping was rampant at times. I returned to get some cutlery on one occasion to find my food had been thrown away by a French couple so they could take our table.On the plus side the bus service was great and we never waited more than 5 minutes for a bus",Disneyland_Paris

115786725,1,2011-7,United Arab Emirates,"Just came back from Disney Paris.   Actually it' our second time.   This time we had nice time only because of our good spirit. The rides were extremely crowded and not everything has a fast pass. Grown ups squash us when they see me with 2 small children and take our place.   In all the corners of the park and on the green areas where we lined up for the rides you see cigarettes, papers and garbage. Bees are everywhere and they chase you to death if you have a lollipop or anything sweet in your hands.   So, imagine what happens if a bee attacks my 1.5 years old baby while eating anything sweet.   The toilets are filthy.   It looks like they are cleaned only once a day when the park closes or maybe not at all.   Peter pan ride needs maintenance as at the end of the day it feels like it's boats are going to crash.   It's not the same when you ride it in the morning.   A lot of the rides were not working and we were very disappointed.   The staff in the rides are not friendly.   Maybe they were also affected by the financial crisis? They were dull, not funny, not smiley, it's like someone has cut off their salaries and work for free and they are not happy about it.   Or maybe they feel bored doing the same thing every day??!! Even some of the characters were dull and felt like they want to get over with it like  belle  whose lips were sealed and she had that  don't come near me  all over her though we were the first ones to greet her.   Maybe she didnt speak English????   Everything is extremely expensive.   The food, the toys, the gifts.   This is supposed to be a place to have fun and it's ok to spend but all over it certainly is overpriced.   It's like you are being robbed.   Imagine if you have 2 kids and they want each a costume which are priced at 60 and45 euros, you end up spending only on the costumes 105 euros without the accessories.   Not to talk about the food cause you can somehow break your child's heart and don't get them the costumes but you can't stay without food. Generally, the park is not like it was before, it needs a lot of maintenance and cleaning. Rules and regulations across the park need to be reviewed, like some priority or rules need to be set for small children so that they don't get squashed or their places taken by inconsiderate grown ups. And generally disney's concept need to be reviewed when it comes to the staff's attitude and the prices across the park.",Disneyland_Paris
115778075,4,2011-7,Australia,"Our family 2 adults and 2 children (8 and 4) visited the Disneyland Park and Studios with a 1 day 2 park ticket. We all thoroughly enjoyed the day, the weather was great. We purchased our tickets at the gate and found only a short queue on arrival (having arrived from Paris itself on the train just on the 10am opening). One thing we found in the first few hours of opening was the long queues for the rides. Myself and my son lined up for the Autopedia ride, which was an hour wait. The ride was good but not worth an hours wait. We then visited the play areas, such as the Indian Village in Frontier Land. we also had an early lunch to beat the crowds and were able to get our lunch and a table at Cafe Hyperion without a wait.We then went to the Studios and watched the shows and Parades during the middle of the day. These were great and no queues. Towards the end of the day we went back to the rides and were able to take quite a few rides in the Studio park with only 15 minute waits. The final parades and July 14 fireworks were the highlight of the day.Overall we thoroughly enjoyed the day. The queues for the rides in the middle of the day were long, but there is plenty of other things to do that doesn't require you to queue (go back to the rides later in the day when the queues are shorter). the food and drinks are expensive, but not way out of line with similar attractions, and you shouldn't let this spoil your day.",Disneyland_Paris

115751400,4,2011-7,Malta,"Just back from 5 fantastic days in DLP, unfortunatley it rained every day but we still managed to see and do everything. We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge in a newly refurbished Montana room, only 10 minutes walk from the park. We found both parks to be clean and very well organized. Park attendants very friendly and helpful, public toilets always clean. Never queued for more than 30mins for rides but when possible it is best to use Fast Pass. Could go to the park by 8am as we were staying in a Disney hotel but most of the rides do not open till 10am. We had half board plus meal vouchers and enjoyed all the restaurants we went to. Only disappointment is that our pushchair got stolen from outside a ride, fortunatley we had nothing valuable in it but i really cannot believe how parents can bring their kids to Disney and than steal another family's pushchair.....we did not let this incident spoil our stay, Disney kindly lent us one for the remainder of our stay but we had to go to the shopping centre Val d' Europe to get a new one as we were due to go to Paris for 5 days and i really could not immagine how my 2 year old daughter could get by without her stroller. So please if you are going to the park take a small chain and lock and make sure you use them, I never thought my pushchair would  vanish  but it did ! Would highly reccomend the Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and a meal at Cafe Mickey's with the Characters, my kids loved it. The night parade in Disney, is really magical. We will definely return when our kids are abit older, it is truly a magical place !",Disneyland_Paris
115652320,4,2011-7,United Kingdom,"Having just got back I will give you our findings good and bad. We were 4 adults and one 4 year old, and we got 2day 2park passes and found there was something for all ages. Our 4 year old had a great time, however we took him on Crusher's Coaster (Nemo) ,in the Walt Disney Studio park, and while he was just tall enough to go on, it was too fast. It was a roller coaster, mostly in the dark and flung you around a lot. In fact he was very frightened and I would not recommend this for smaller children at all. I wouldn't bother with the Armageddon special effects, this was very poor and we all thought was a waste of time, but the other rides and shows were very good. Be prepared for long waits, on average 45   60 minutes. Some of the rides do a Fastrack, where you can 'book' a time, but you still have to wait for a short while. Foodwise as you might expect, was overpriced fast food. and crisps and soft drinks are expensive, so take some with you. Toad Hall in Disneyland park was was not nice at all, however Blockbuster did some fair sandwiches in the Disney Studio park. As other reviewers have said, they check your bag on the way in, but not for food etc, just for security purposes. Another tip, wear suitable footwear, because you walk for miles, and we had very wet weather   not what we were expecting for July! They do sell plastic rain hooded capes, but at 7 9 Euros depending on size, runs a bit expensive for a family. Most of the staff are friendly and helpful, however they do need to monitor the toilets more frequently for cleaning purposes, as they were quite dirty smelly later on in the day. I know there are thousands using them each day, but they should allow for that. Check your programme for the character time appearances, as you don't tend to see them walking about. Also be prepared to be pushed about, as most people didn't seem to have grasped the concept of waiting your turn. Adults were pushing children aside to shove theirs to the front for photos!But even with the not so good points, they were outweighted by the good points and we all enjoyed our visit and and we would visit again.",Disneyland_Paris
115605447,5,2011-7,France,"Now I'm a massive cynic about these types of things (as is my partner), usually have zero interest in theme parks, even lower tolerance for childrens attractions and crowds, and hate the excessive consumerist culture that Disney promotes. Plus, after reading some of the reviews, I was bracing myself for a pretty, well, tedious day at best. BUT by the end of the day, we had to admit....we were Disney converts. Had a perfect day.This is a review for adults attending the park (we skipped a lot of the children stuff):We went as a group of four adults ranging in ages between 23 and 43, on a wednesday during grey weather (turned out to be a great idea as it kept the crowds down a little!). Waiting times for rides were never more than 40 minutes (at worst. On average we waited around 20 minutes for each, unless we used fastpasses, which are a godsend). If you're only interested in rollercoasters you can easily get everything done in one day, but for more you're going to be pressed for time. We started off by doing all the major 'grown up' rides except for one (loved them all), had lunch on the run   we brought a packed lunch, which I strongly suggest doing   then moved on to the slower paced attractions like the Pirates of the Caribbean, Armageddon, the Studio Tram Tour, Phantom Manor, and It's a Small World (okay, that last ones for kids but as you can see we were really getting into the spirit of things!), all of which was fun and unmissable. To our surprise we ended up staying until after dark and watching the parade and even enjoyed that! Even in the dreary weather after being on our feet for ten hours, walking around and watching the lights and parade was a lovely, and surprisingly romantic, ending to the day.My only 2 complaints: of course the food is expensive, don't be naive   it's Disneyland. But if you want to sit and have a 'decent' meal (ie not fast food) the options were a bit limited. We saw families and larger groups being turned away at the restaurant we ate at (Silver Spur Steakhouse)   one big tip is to either settle for fast food, or make a reservation ahead of time! Secondly, aside from the parades, we didnt see all that many characters (three or four in total), although I think that's due in part to our lack of organisation. I suppose next time we'll read the program and plan the day beforehand.I've read so many negative reviews here and it saddens me really. An experience is what YOU make it, and you have to put aside your need to judge and compare and just get into the spirit of things. It's Disneyland   you're there to have fun, not to focus on negatives. Describing it as 'run down'   really? We were pretty impressed with how it looked, and the cleanliness. The only thing being repaired was the ship at Pirates Beach. People have complained about the supposed rude service   I didnt see this at all (although maybe we dont notice it anymore as we live in France?), although I DID see a number of tourists being discourteous to staff members, and was genuinely disappointed to see the rude sense of expectation and entitlement that people seem to have when they visit there. Relax, people! Seeing parents with sour faces around their kids is really not cool.Me and my partner arrived home at 2am, tired but elatedly happy. We'll be back.",Disneyland_Paris
115561410,5,2011-7,Kuwait,"A great attraction, it is fun for the entire family and located in a great place. The park is big but rather small compared to the other Disneyland. The park is quite nice and not that busy, it is divided into 5 secotins which have rides for all ages. The park is aimed with rides that the youg and the old will enjoy with many amazing rollercoasters. There are a couple of shows to watch around the park and many parades to see. I would recommend staying for 3 days at the park. I would recommend coming in the morning and staying all through the day. There are tasty and great resturants at Disneyland around the park. The hotels are great and the weather is amazing. I would bring walking shows and a camera. The rides are fun and amazing and there is not a long line at all of the rides. They are aimed for all ages and each section has rides for everyone to enjoy. Some of the rides will have pictures taken on them and I reccoomend buying those as they are one of the best souveniers you can buy at Disneyland.

We went to Disneyland CA in Xmas and it was warm for god's sakes. Yes, I went there in a hot summer too, but I'd much, MUCH rather have heat and not sick children ('cause Disneyland children), than freeze in JULY. Why didn't they make it say in Italy?? Much better weather, people actually speak English there, and it's not like the food we ate at Disneyland or in the area in general wasn't pizzas and pastas anyway. ANYWAY. Kids loved it, as expected. However, I had a very bad experience with the Indiana Jones ride. We did the baby switch thing, so I didn't have time to check what it was like before. Poor moi thought it was like the Disneyland Indiana Jones ride. It ended up being a really scary (for me) rollercoaster, with nothing to see, but that's notwhat my problem was. At night I couldn't move AT ALL from the pain on my back, and the next day I just stayed at the hotel, doing nothing but taking painkillers and counting the minutes for the next painkiller. And this is a person with no preexisting backproblems. Maybe women in their late thirties that have given birth twice shouldn't be riding it? idkI have two young girls, and their favorites were Peter Pan ride, Studio tram ride and Buzz Lightyear. They also loved meeting Rapunzel. I HIGHLY recommend the strollers. It was like 18 euros for two girls (5 and 7) for two days but highly worth it",Disneyland_Paris

I love Disney, and came to DLP a few years ago as a surprise birthday present   I just can't believe how run down it's become in such a short space of time. At many times the big rides were shut, with little information given about why. These included Big Thunder Mountain, Tower of Terror, Space Mountain. The staff seemed very bored and nobody went out of their way to be helpful or friendly. There were mice in McDonalds and in Billy Bob's resturant, and staff's attitude was very blase and said  Yes, it's Mickey and Minnie'. They didn't think it was a big deal to have mice running around where people were eating. Was told by a member of staff out of hours that the park is overun with vermin and if Health and Safety got in they would shut it down. Nice!

115366724,3,2011-5,United States,"The great unwashed are pre eminent in Disneyland which seems to have gone so hugely down market (no doubt through economic necessity) that it defies belief. At Inventions restaurant at flagship Disneyland Hotel Paris, a huddle of six receptionists check each arrival. If only such care was taken by chefs who achieve making everything taste bland... but why bother when obese, voucher laden, teeth picking clientele remain oblivious? I wrote this while there on my Blackberry and then held it up to show Pluto (who crept up on me as I was finishing typing at restaurant table). Pluto read it, nodded, patted me on the back and did a high five. What a classic from a Disney character. Yet again, I returned to our hotel with a FOUL taste in my mouth. This NEVER happens anywhere else. The previous night we endured a dreadful supper at Mickey's Cafe.....and heaven help those that need to visit the stinking loos. A worn out Mickey Mouse and other characters, trying to be jovial in this depressing 50's factory canteen, visited our table......character appearances are the only reason this poor excuse for a Restaurant is always packed....it certainly isn't for the food or the decor. Disneyland is crumbling. People badly injured recently when parts fell off Thunder Mountain attraction. This place is a concrete jungle, that has seen better days serving up foul food to the masses. And kids love it. On our final night we dined at the Steakhouse. That's the best option at Paris Disney. Odd, but one can order Louis Roederer Crystal for much less than it costs to buy a bottle in the UK. Quite a bargain although Crystal is not like it used to be. A visit to the Steak House was the highlight for me, even if the loos serving this enormous restaurant in the Disney Village are miniscule.For lunch the best bet is the restaurant at Pirates of the Caribbean. We went every day. The fast food restaurants are fine if you want to eat pizza which tastes like cardboard.",Disneyland_Paris
115301074,2,2011-7,United States,"It's Disney so the attractions are first rate. We've been to Disney World in Florida numerous times so we did enjoy seeing the differences in well known rides like Space Mountain and the Pirates of the Caribbean. That said, this park has numerous flaws that Disney World does not and thankfully does not. Employees are content to engage each other in conversation while ignoring you. The typical Disney friendliness was something we saw maybe half the time, (It's Paris, I guess that should be expected.) We couldn't get a Fast Pass reader to recognize one of our tickets and the guy manning the machines was content to say he could not help. Until of course you act like a Parisian and refuse to take no for an answer. Funny how all of a sudden he can fix the problem.What really surprised us was the dirt and how unclean it was. I can understand how that can occur as everyone smokes and their cigarette butts end up everywhere. But, even the bathrooms were filthy. I did see one young lady attempting to pick up the paper on the floor, well at least every third piece of paper.Behavior was allowed that you wouldn't see at any Disney Park in the US. Multiple people cutting the line, for starters. On the Tower of Terror the Disney employee stood there discussing with the woman her cutting for a good five minutes. Everyone around her said her group cut so what's to discuss? At WDW, she would have been tossed, in Paris they debate the issue and she and her family stroll away.I do have to say it was amusing seeing the man take a siesta undisturbed by any form of security on the grass next Main Street, a woman attempt to take her sleeping 6 month old onto the spinning tea cups and the 4 year old on the carousel snapping pictures with no seat belt on because the ride operator didn't bother walking the rest of the ride to make a safety check.Lunch was fine at a counter service location, even if no one bothered to clear their own trash. Perhaps Europeans visiting Disneyland Paris are more accepting of the pushiness on line and the complete lack of anything resembling personal space. I ride the NYC subway so I can handle the occasional need for close quarters. But 10 hours of being pushed with little regard for social norms is tiring.If you are an American visiting Paris with children and you've been to Disney World, please don't expect that experience when contemplating a day trip. There is a lot to enjoy in Paris, a side trip to Disney was disappointingly not among them.",Disneyland_Paris
115276916,4,2011-7,China,"Our kids loved the place, despite the queues. The park is looking faded and needs a lot of works. It lacks the attention to details that you expect from Disney and its just not up to the standards of the US parks. But all the ingredients are here for a great family holiday.What stands out, with very few exceptions is the staff. I am sure they are selected for lack of communication ability, inability to smile and general rudeness. They just spoils the place. If they spent as much time helping guest as gossiping with each other it would be good start. Therebis no customer service ethos, basically, they could not care less and will do little to help you. They are a real let down and spoil the place. Clearly a lack of care or leadership in this area, because it was true across both parks.",Disneyland_Paris
115254578,1,2011-6,Australia,We went to euro Disney while on a family holiday from Australia. All my daughter wanted to do for her birthday was to go to Disney. We went all 9 of us and were shocked at how terrible it was. Long delays many rides not even working ( which we weren't told as we paid) Smoking parents everywhere. Hands down the worst day of our European holiday. My sad little girl left after being on 2 dud rides quoting   Never go to Disney it ruins childhood dreams,Disneyland_Paris
115224570,2,2011-7,United Kingdom,"Went last week with my 9 year old, 5 year old, husband and brother. Queued for over an hour for each ride, only to be told when we got near the front the rides had broken. Not even offered fast passes to get on them quicker the next time. The park was so busy we only managed to get on 8 rides between 5 of us in 4 days! The queue jumping with the French was terrible and everywhere you went was so expensive it stopped being enjoyable. We got told it would be great to book  breakfast in the park  at 8 am which entitled you to the park being exclusively for the people who booked to go there before it opened. What it didnt tell you was that the rides are not open till 10 am. which meant we had grumpy tired children the rest of the day for no reason! I have since been advised that Orlando is the best place to go for magic for the children (we spent the whole time trying to make it magical for the kids so all wasnt lost). Not a place we will ever return to again !",Disneyland_Paris
115180283,4,2011-7,United Kingdom,"Just returned from ED yesterday along with in laws, wife and two kids. The standard of the park IMO was fine, although they need to treat the decaying pavements etc as there are cracks everywhere. Why dont they relay the pavements and paint them with Disyney characters to give the area a bit more colour??You will wait around 1 hour to get on a ride lasting no more than 90 seconds. The queues are well managed as i saw no problems with pushing etc. The parades are wonderful, well rehearsed and very colourful.However, inside the park there are no shops or supermarkets to purchase water, soda etc. if you want water or soda, the cost of a 50cl bottle is around 3euros, which is more than double what you would pay in the UK. So Disney have you captured in this respect. if you do want to obtain cheaper drink, food etc, there is a petrol station beside the Sante Fe hotel and the prices there are reasonable  normal. Alternatively, you could take the train for a 1 minute ride to Val d' Europe where you can find a fantastic supermarket called Auchan. Best to stock up there with water, soda food etc unless you are happy to pay the aforementioned prices.Most restuarants you will pay around 23 euros for a pizza, pasta, fajitas etc and tdont expect the quality to reflect the price as the standard is very average at best.I stayed at Sequoia lodges which were very good. Id definetley go back, although id be prepared for the long queues and have my food hamper packed!!",Disneyland_Paris
115142564,4,2011-5,Australia,"I did a lot of research for his Park and the result was low expectations. Constant reports of ride breakdowns, rude staff (Cast Members), poor maintenance, dirty facilities, terrible food etc. seemed to be the norm but I   m glad to say (other than the food), we did not see too much evidence of these problems. Yes, some of the attractions could do with some new paint and the park itself is not as clean as Anaheim   s Disneyland was when I last visited it 30 years ago.None of the rides broke down whilst we were on or waiting for them. If you arrive early or wait until late afternoon evening, you will find (in late May), that you won   t have to wait as long. Also make sure you learn how to use the Fast Pass system. There were long lines 30 years ago so nothing has changed and it means the Parks are still popular.All of the Cast Members and Characters in the costumes that we came across were co operative and polite except for the Captain Jack Sparrow Character. He was supposed to appear at a particular place for photos and quite a long line (of which we were part of), had formed. He not only arrived about 15 minutes late but also did not go to the photo shoot place. He just pranced around and did not stand still long enough for a photo.The food options and quality really was bad. The Last Chance Cafe in particular was extremely bad. My daughter and I both had to have our drinks replaced as they served us with cups of    slightly flavoured water    instead of the ordered soft drinks. The food they served was also terrible.It   s A Small World ride is worth a mention because when I last saw it I thought it was boring and a waste of time. Rather than wait outside, I went on it and was absolutely delighted. Now that is what I call an upgrade!Rather than repeat a lot of the excellent advice given in previous reviews here, I strongly recommend you do a lot of research here at TA and at other Disney web sites before visiting. My research taught me simple things like where to buy the cheapest bottled water (at the Train Station) and to go to breakfast early (if staying in one of the Disney hotels). These tips can save you a lot of money and time.",Disneyland_Paris
115043985,3,2011-6,United States,"We stayed at Disney for two nights and so had two and a half days there. As adults we struggled to find enough things to do to fill our time. I can imagine is you have children they will want to meet characters, watch all the shows, go on all the little rides etc. The traditional rides were surprisingly fun especially Peter Pan's flight. It was shames that there was so much refurbishment going on. Both Crush's coaster and Indiana Jones were closed and so my OH was really disappointed. It seems a bit silly to close two very similar rides at the same time. We enjoyed Big Thunder Mountain, Star Tours and Buzz Lightyear. There aren't as many medium thrill rides available. I don't like big roller coasters and so we even ended up going on It's Small World which was surprisingly cute lol! There seemed to be quite a few staff hanging around the place in uniform which I thought was odd. Queues were fine and the park was fairly clean and tidy. We found toilets and places to eat easy. Overall we had fun which is the main aim but it wasn't completely magical and amazing. I think one or two days is fine if you're adults.",Disneyland_Paris
115010331,2,2011-3,United Kingdom,"As my husbands 30th birthday present i decided to take him and the kids away to Disneyland Paris for the weekend. We didn't enjoy it at all and so i thought i'd write this review to let everyone know the problems we had. A large number of the rides were closed due to non peak time, we had expected some closures but it was the majority of the main attractions that they had closed leaving all the smaller boring rides open. We found that the park staff didn't really organise the character meet and greets very well, poor Daisy Duck nearly got trampled by the rude visitors. Then to make things worse the non dressed up staff started shouting at the visitors and told everyone that Daisy would choose who goes next. Nobody listened and so we gave up and walked away with 2 very upset well behaved children whilst Daisy signed autographs for the kids who pushed in front of us.We had the same problem at the parade, we stood right on the edge of the curb and had other visitors stand in front of us on the road where you weren't allowed to stand and right in front of our children so they couldn't see. Again on the rides people pushing in front of you.....you're starting to get the idea now. I've never been to a place where the visitors were so rude and disrespectful. We've visited DisneyWorld in Florida and you do expect a certain amount of pushing but I've never seen anything like i did in Paris. Everything was overpriced (including the park entrance!) and some of the staff in the shops and restaurants spoke very poor English (McDonalds) which meant it took twice as long to order our food and i actually gave up trying to order one thing which was on the menu because they couldn't understand me. We did both the Magic kingdom and the Studios park in about half a day and at that point we'd seen everything there was to see and we had all had enough.There was just no Disney Magic in this place for us at all and it was such a disappointment that we will not be returning again.The park may be better in peak times   i don't know but for us DLP was not!",Disneyland_Paris
114960196,2,2011-6,United States,"I'm a huge Disney fan and when I had the opportunity to visit Disneyland Paris I decided to go for it. I had read the previous reviews on the park, a lot of which were not great. I wanted to have an open mind and judge for myself.We went into just the one park, for a few hours on one of the hottest days of the year. It was crowded but not terribly crowded, I'm sure the extreme heat had a lot to do with that which worked in our favor.I did notice that a few things needed repair, however overall it wasn't too run down. I was surprised by how many things were undergoing renovation during the beginning of one of the busiest times of the year for Disneyland Paris. A lot of the bigger rides (Indiana Jones, Crush's Coaster) were both closed and there were a lot of boarded up areas on Main Street.What I liked were the things unique to Disneyland Paris. Mainly La Tani  re du Dragon, and the Nautilus walk throughs. Overall I felt like this park was a bad knockoff of Disneyland in California. The staff was very friendly and helpful but like someone else said the magic just isn't there.",Disneyland_Paris

114819291,1,2011-6,Sweden,"If you're in France, this is the absolute last thing you should be wanting to do. Save your money and go to real castles, even if you have children.When I visited, a very large part of the park was closed (including rides) for 'renovations for your future enjoyment', which of course was not advertised when purchasing our tickets. Nor was there any signage in the park about closures, which meant that you would walk down numerous streets only to come to dead ends and have to backtrack constantly. It was extremely frustrating.The rides were minimal   only 3 'big thrill' rides and not that many that I saw for children, either, there were absolutely no carnival games where you could play to win prizes, not a single Disney character in sight, not enough restaurants for the mass of people (even in non peak eating times). As another reviewer so accurately described it, this was simply a giant Disney themed shopping mall. The shops didn't even have much variety between each other, either   they all carried essentially the same merchandise with only a slight variation and the consumer panic in every shop was sickening.Our assessment of the entire experience was very poor. We expected more from Disney. If you absolutely must come here, don't bother unless your children are six years old or younger and you're interested in losing a ton of money on naff Disney merchandise and being nagged all day by your children to buy things for them, because that's all your entertainment options.",Disneyland_Paris

We had 3 1 2 days in the park, 1 day in the Disney Studios and 1 day sightseeing in Paris. We found that we needed all that time, in order to enjoy the park without too much stress. It is crowded, and there are ques to everything, but if you plan ahead you'll be able to enjoy the rides and resturants without too much people! Go early or late for the big rides, and also check the website for information on rides that are closed! Have your meales a bit early or late to skip the longest ques! Make sure to plan extra time to meet the caracters if you bring young children, that's definitely worth it (even though it takes about 30 minutes to que for each of them) !

Will remember this for ever, loved every minute of it!",Disneyland_Paris
114719171,5,2011-5,United Kingdom,"I travelled with my wife and our two sons (8 and 6) at the end of May and had 4 days 3 nights there. We went on the Eurostar from Ebbsfleet station, which still looks brand new. You can park very close by for   8 a day. It   s a very slick operation and they tell you where to stand on the platform so you can enter the correct coach for your reserved seating. The Eurostar train itself was disappointing     our train was rather grubby and we were not overly pleased to be sitting backwards all the way. There are two buffet cars but they are hopeless     I had to queue up for 30 minutes in an effort to buy very expensive drinks and snacks, but by the time I got to the counter they had sold out of almost everything. We booked late at a busy time so could not take the Eurostar all the way to Disneyland, so instead we took the Eurostar to Lille and then changed for a high speed TGV train. This was a double decker train, much smarter than the Eurostar. An hour and 15 minutes later we were off the train and we emerged right in the middle of it all! Disney Village has most of the restaurants and bars, it is a very short walk from the station and the two theme parks are just past the village. Turn left and there is a row of bus stops with free shuttle buses every 12 minutes to take you to your hotel. We stayed at the Cheyenne, it   s not luxurious but it is more than adequate and good fun. The hotel rooms are arranged in buildings much like a Wild West town, our family room had a double bed and a bunk bed for the boys. Colour TV and bath shower but no tea coffee facilities     you can buy a basket for    7 for 2 or 3 drinks but it would be best to bring your own travel kettle. You are offered a choice of times for your breakfast: 7, 8 or 9am. We chose the 7am sitting as we wanted to be in the park when it opened at 8am for the Extra Magic Hours (10am start if you are not staying at Disney). You have an excellent selection of cold meats, cheeses, yoghurts, croissants and 4 cereals, and you can go back for as much as you want. Everyone takes rolls in their bags for lunch and nobody minds. I love a decent cup of coffee but the black coffee at Disneyland was poor     but the caf   au lait was really nice. You can help yourself to hot drinks and fruit juices too. Breakfast quickly gets very busy and has been likened to a bun fight but it   s all good natured!We went first into the Magic Kingdom, and it is immaculately clean and tidy. They have happy music playing in the background but are clever enough to hide the speakers from view. As you enter the park under the railway station you head up Main Street which is full of beautiful buildings and shops. This can get crowded so we followed another reviewer   s tip to walk up through one of the arcades on either side of Main Street as they are much less crowded and you can get to the rides more quickly! You have to check on the weekly programme which rides are open early, there are only about 6 until the park opens properly at 10am. It   s worth going in early as the crowds are reasonable at that time of day. Our boys    favourite rides were Buzz Lightyear and Small World. We tried several times to get a train ride around the park but the queues were so long. And even when we got near the head of the queue, not many people got off the train so we gave up waiting in the end.There are loads of restaurants around, or you can eat at your hotel. It costs about    70 for two courses for a family of 4, without drinks, although table water is free. The price is much the same everywhere within Disneyland so go prepared! Again, our hotel had a magnificent choice of dishes but some of them could have been hotter. And as it   s a buffet you can go back for as much as you want. We did have a burger and chips for lunch one day, with a soft drink, and this cost about    40 for the four of us. The parks close at 10pm at the weekend and 7pm on a weekday. On the Monday at 7pm the crowds descended on Disney Village and queued out of the doors for the restaurants, so it is definitely worth booking a table earlier on that day.We did splash out on the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show. This is pretty entertaining with real horses and buffalo and they feed you a cowboy supper at the same time. Not masses of food but enough to eat, and free lager too! We arrived an hour early upon someone   s recommendation as they have pre show entertainment in the bar which is worth seeing, a gun slinger and a 3 piece country band. I bought a pint of lager, a pint of shandy and two fruit juices for    18. You are presented with a cowboy hat which you get to keep. The hats have a coloured band and you are encouraged to cheer for the cowboy wearing your colour. You are allocated a long table and you choose your own seats on that table. The tickets for the show cost    208 (  180) for the 4 of us and it was good, but I   m not sure we got full value for money. This was for the cheaper Category B tickets     no point paying extra for the better seats as you get a great view where ever you sit.The Walt Disney Film Studios park seems aimed at a slightly older visitor. It   s not as big as the Magic Kingdom but still plenty to see. We thought the car stunt show was excellent but I was a bit disappointed with the tram ride     the tanker disaster was very good but the London street disaster was just a static display. You have to do the Crush Coaster ride it is excellent! The Toy Soldiers parachute drop is good fun and I went on the Aerosmith Rock    n    Rollercoaster with our elder son, this is even better than Space Mountain. We would not recommend the Slinky Dog ride as it took 20 minutes to queue up, then it takes 2 or 3 minutes for the staff to unload load the passengers, and finally you get a tame ride lasting just 57 seconds!The Fastpass system worked well for us, you insert your park tickets in the machine and then you come back at a pre allocated time slot and can then skip most of the queuing. The queues were mostly 10 20 minutes long, and about 50 minutes for Crush   s Coaster but that is worth the wait!There is a daily parade in each park, and we found these excellent. In the film studios park they put on a song and dance show around the Place des Stars so it would be worth siting yourself around this area. We would recommend taking a position one hour before each parade to be sure of a front row view point.All the Disney staff (Cast Members) were excellent, they were very polite, cheerful and helpful, and they all speak English too. We did some shopping and the girl was kind enough to offer to have our items delivered to our hotel. You have to spend    30 or more, be staying in a Disney hotel and it needs to be before 3pm for this free service. It was a nice touch so we were not lugging around too many bags.We prepared well for our trip having read all about it on Trip Advisor. When we went they had a heatwave over there, we hadn   t packed shorts and they don   t sell any in the shops there. We knew it was going to be expensive so we allowed for that, all the prices seem double what we pay in the UK, but we had a fantastic time and would certainly recommend it.",Disneyland_Paris

In the parade the eyes of Simba (Lion King) were broken   its just something you cant imagine happening at the Florida parks.

Very disappointing, we wont be returning.",Disneyland_Paris
114651978,3,2011-6,United States,"Set aside an extra day of our vacation to visit Disneyland Paris as my daughter and I are huge Disney fans. Knowing that we only had one day to spend in the Park we were happy to just be content in being in the park and seeing what it was like rather than trying to ride every ride that there was. We also knew beforehand not to expect that this would be a carbon copy of our beloved Disneyland Park in Anaheim. I knew that the rides would be different, the layout different etc. What I did expect was the same  Disney  standards that I have become accustomed to in Anaheim. I expected an immaculately clean park and friendly outgoing cast members. You don't realize what you have until it is gone. There was no  magical  feel to the Disneyland Paris and my daughter and I both heartily agree that it was due in large part to the indifference from the cast members and the lack of general cleanliness. How the cast members interact with the guests is very telling and I have to say that most of the cast members at Disneyland Paris didn't smile, didn't acknowledge that you were there, and we just got the feeling that they were there just for a paycheck. It was very disappointing and we certainly did not get the feeling that we were a  welcomed guest  like we do everytime we walk through the turnstiles at Disneyland Park in Anaheim. I really do believe that the lack of genuine fun and caring interaction between the cast members and the guests made this much less than a five star experience.The other disappointing part of our experience was the general lack of cleanliness and of course, the non stop smoking everywhere. Yes, the bathrooms were indeed a step above most of European standards but they still were far below what we are used to in our US Disney parks. The park itself was not filthy but still littered with small bits of garbage that had sat for far too long and of course many many cigaratte butts littering the ground. I know it is Europe and I certainly got used to smoke being blown my way every minute of the day but I expected a reprieve in Disneyland Paris   not so. Why do they allow smoking in the lines etc.?? I did not expect that nor did I appreciate that.On the good side, it was certainly interesting to see a different version of Disneyland and some parts of the park were very beautiful and well maintained such as the entrance and Main Street. They had interesting twists on some of the attractions and many of the shops were merchandised very attractively and imaginatively. Speaking of merchandise, they have an odd mix and if you are looking to buy Mickey ears then good luck to you! Also it was very obvious when we were walking around the park that no one wears  Disney  gear. When you are in Anaheim everyone and their grandma has on some kind of Disney shirt but not so in Disneyland Paris. Not that it is bad, just odd. As far as food goes we had a hard time finding anything that was very appealing for the cost we had to pay. In fact, later on in the day we had a hard time finding food at all, many places that we had spied earlier in the day had already closed by the time we went to eat and I am talking about 6 pm, not late at night. We crisscrossed the park and about three places in a row we searched out had already closed   it was almost comical. Not sure why that was but it was what happened. All in all food was so so, nothing anything special that we came across. Looked in earnest for Mickey pretzels, fudge and caramel apples but found none :(.As far as the rides go I would have to say that they were certainly entertaining and although there were many we missed due to time constraints we had fun. Pirates of the Caribbean was unique as it is totally backwards from what we are used to, Small World was bright and colorful with different scenes that were enjoyable but the ride was much shorter than expected. Loved that Peter Pan had a fast pass!! Wasn't a big fan of Indiana Jones and I think that many Europeans are missing out since they get such an odd version. Not sure why they couldn't have duplicated that ride as we know it.Overall the experience was good but as stated in the title, I really don't think that Disneyland Paris as it is run now would pass the approval of Walt Disney. It needs a good dose of good old fashioned curteous customer service that Walt Disney strived for and demanded.",Disneyland_Paris
114619412,4,2011-6,United Kingdom,"Hi all, I've reviewed Disney before but not for a while. Came back yesterday from a 5night 6 day trip. We flew with AirFrance from Bristol, I have to say, we have used coach and eurostar before and flying is by far the smoothest and easiest mode of transport for a stress free trip, especially with children (mine are 5 and 11 girls). We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge in a Montana room, please be aware that Montana rooms are not in the main hotel block but in seperate lodges which are blocks of a few rooms (same standard as the main block) but set away from the main hotel, the farthest away lodges make it a bit of a trek for breakfast and to walk into the parks for little ones. We had a newly refurbished room, seems alot of refurbishment on the rooms is going on at the moment. Room was, as previously, clean, comfy and perfectly servicable, we had cleaners every day for towel loo roll soap replacement and to make beds and to change if needed. As usual, although new flatscreen tvs, still only 4 english speaking channels, bbc world news, french news, disney uk, euronews. Breakfast at the hotel is exactly the same as always, unlimited bread rolls, croissants, pain au chocolat, cheese of various nature, meats of various nature, cereals, toast and yoghurts, olives, tomato salsa and garlic puree. All of good quality, but a bit repetetive, although there is a menu that can be very reasonably purchased of american breakfast (bacon eggs sausage chipped potatoes and salad!? for 4.50 euros or sausage and bacon for 3.80 euros plus another option) we did this in fathers day for a treat and because we were a little fed up of the continental version. Can't fault the hotel, staff are friendly and helpful,food great, hotel clean and comfortable. Now for the villae and parks itself. On lake disney there is a little white train that picks up at each of the hotels on the lake and drops you at the village, a little lazy, i know but helpful for kids feet! Please be aware that this train is not free and once aboard, we were asked to pay 2 euros pp, so cost us 8 euros to go one side of the lake to another! Total rip off! Disney village has a new eatery called the Earl of Sandwhich which was reasonably priced, here and mcdonalds are the cheapest places to eat in the whole of disney. Entertainment was great in the village and we seen circus acts,beatboxers,dubstep dancers and double dutch skippers, perfect for my 11 yr old daughter! Table service at the sports bar is fast and attentive without overly so, so thumbs up there too. Ate at King Ludwigs Castle, amazing, as always, beautifully decorated, great atmosphere and tasty food. Kids 3 course was 8.90 euros and we had dish of the day plus a drink for 10.90 each. Security has been stepped up since our last visit with scanning machines for all bags into the village and into the parks, understandably so, for all our safety. Parks were spotlessly clean, plenty of toilets, roaming staff for assistance and transport. You can use the railroad to get to di9fferent worlds in the park and a old fashioned bus to get down main street. A bit dissapointed with the rides as quite a few were closed, ok for us because we were there 6 days and eventually got on all the rides but for thiose day trippers i would of been unhappy, at one point every ride in the new toy story land was closed! I would check online before travelling for a short stay as, in all fairness, disney put all scheduled ride closures on their website. Expect long queues or use fastpass and be prepared to be as obstinet and rude as some of the europeans as they will stop at nothing to get their children seen before yours, you got to be ruthless. Finally, disney, as always, is expensive, take lots of funds but if you cant remember that there is an esso garage outside santa fe and a short walk outside sequioa which, especially for beer and randon snack, is far cheaper than anywhere in disney, ots about 15 min walk, but french laws stop them serving alcohol after 8pm! So, enjoy, relax but be prepared for lots of walking and spending, ive been 3 times and never been put off : )Oh and the best bits aside from the rides are Stitch live, great for little ones, the Studio Tram Tour and the Stunt show featuring Lightening McQueen x",Disneyland_Paris
114608451,4,2011-6,United Kingdom,"Just got back after spending a (very) short break at Disneyland Paris. It was good fun. I went with my two teenage daughters as they have a day off school (inset day). We only went for two days (1 night) as there is no Eurostar on Saturdays during term time. Anyway, we had a good time all round. Euro Disney is now getting old and although it is typical Disney standard, this is our least favourite. There was no firework display (we love fireworks) but the parade was very good. Having been to Disney World (Orlando) and Disney Hong Kong several times (and Euro Disney once before), this is definitely not as exciting and good fun as others. It is good for a short break and we did enjoy ourselves very much. The food and drinks are not cheap but then it is in Paris! We stayed in the Vienna Magic Circus hotel which is very close to the Park (free shuttle service) and it is a lovely hotel with decor in the theme of circus, even the wardrobe!",Disneyland_Paris
114430393,1,2011-3,Brazil,"On the day of travelling back home we decided to spend the day at Disney and we had our passaports stolen at one of the park stores. Very dissapointing as we missed our flights and a huge mess to get new passaports. Apart from the stress from having our passaports stolen, the support from Lost&Found department was very bad and we had no support from the park. On your visit be very careful with your valuables!!",Disneyland_Paris
114128015,4,2010-7,Australia,"I had been to Disneyland in Anaheim and Disneyworld in Orlando many years ago, but this was different because not only is there the Park with the classic rides like 'It's a Small World' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean', but the Disney Studios Park is next door, there's a food and gift shop village next to that, and there are several themed hotels surrounding the Park (we stayed at Newport Bay Club). It was easy to catch the metro from Paris. Well worth a visit to entertain the child in each of us. I'd allow 2 days at least.",Disneyland_Paris
113906717,5,2011-5,United Kingdom,"HiI wanted to write a review about our trip to Disney as I had read so many bad reviews on here before we went that I was almost scared to go!We went to Disney at the end of may, beginning of July and used the Eurostar. This was a great way to get there and all went smoothly. You arrive at disney straight off the train and there are plenty of buses you can hop straight on to get to your accomodation.We stayed at the Cheyenne which suited us fine. Its fairly basic but very clean with a fantastic cowboy theme. The only thing I would say is that breakfast is mayhem! You soon get used to it though and just do your best to find a seat and get your food, bearing in mind this place has up to 1000 guests staying so meal times are never going to be easy.Now for the park. You need to remember before you go that 1. You are going to Paris, the capital, this should tell you straight away that it will not be cheap. 2. You are going to Disney. Have a look on the disney website and you will see that anything disney is not cheap. 3. It's a theme park. There are no cheap theme parks in the UK really and the ones that are cheap are generally rubbish. If you understand this before you go you will not be shocked.The park itself is very clean and there are always staff going around tidying up. The toilets are also very clean, much cleaner than a lot of public toilets here so good if you have children with you.Make sure that you do plenty of research before you go as others have said. Get an idea of what rides there are, you can check the Disney website to see which ones are closed for maintenance before you go. You have to remember that Disney is open 365 days a year so there will always be some sort of maintenance going on. The scaffolding had been taken down at the front of the castle by the time we went which meant we got some lovely photos. There is the disney magical hours whereby you can go in 2 hours early if you are staying in a disney hotel. This didn't really work in our favour as most of the rides that are open in those hours are the ones that we were not that bothered about but for other families this can be very useful. It also means that you can get to a favourite ride that isn't open early and queue before anyone else gets there. Most of the time we went in around 9.30am which suited us.We went on a Sunday and I have to say that I think this is the best time as I would imagine the weekends get very busy. We queued for around 20 minutes for most rides which isn't too bad. We found the bigger rides had less queueing as they were not suitable for a lot of small children. We took our 6 year old twins and they were not bothered about the very small rides but there were about 3 or 4 that they were too small for but we knew that before we went.Fast pass is an absolute must. They are only available for a handful of rides but an absolute godsend. Fastpass is free unlike a lot of UK theme parks where you have to pay for them on top of your entrance fee. You just go to the fast pass machine for the ride, swipe your entrance ticket and you are issued a fastpass ticket with a time at which to return. This means you can go and do other stuff instead of standing queueing all day. You can only have 1 fast pass for each park at a time though so you can't go round every fastpass ride and get a ticket for all of them.The one thing we did notice were the queues to meet characters, they were big at times. Luckily, our children were not bothered about the characters, they were more interested in the rides and shows. There are characters that walk around the park, they get mobbed quite quickly so if you see one, just go straight over and get a pic. Also, pluto turned up at our hotel so the kids met him and had a pic taken which was lovely.Things I would highly recommend are: Tower of terror, absolutely fantastic! The cast really get into character to scare you. We did this ride twice and both times it scared me, Crush's coaster is brilliant although you only have to be 0.9m and to be honest some little ones that are the correct hight will find it quite frightening as it is a roller coaster in the dark, you have no clue what is going to happen next, star tours is great for all the star wars fans (like my son), Big thunder mountain is also good and a lot faster than we thought it was going to be. There are also other experiences such as the stunt show which my son was amazed with, armageddon, a little hidden gem ( I won't spoil it ), Captain EO, animagique which was lovely and well worth seeing. I could go on and on! We didn't have any problems with people pushing in although I did put my hands across railings a couple of times to stop people creeping past. There were a couple of rides that I didn't think were worth the wait. The slinky dog ride has big queues, is pretty rubbish and over in about 1 minute.We went to the parades but you do have to get there about 45 minutes early or you won't be able to see. There are staff that go along to make sure your legs and feet are not in the road too so beware and leave yourself enough room in case you get asked to move back!Now for the food. It's not cheap but not as bad as some people have said, I used the following website to do some research before I went and compiled a list of where I thought would be suitable and within our price range: http:  www.dlrpmagic.com On this website you can look at all the menus and their prices plus loads of other stuff. On the first night we went to Annettes diner in the disney village. I had a foot long hotdog and fries and this was 11euros, this was one of the cheaper meals and was a table service diner. The following night we ate in Ludwigs in the disney village which is another table service place. It was 20 euros for a main meal (we had chicken and chips) and a dessert (we had waffles). The childrens meals was around 12 euros. The good thing about Ludwigs was that they have various happy hours in the bar on beer. The beer was around 7 euros for a pint so with happy hour it was 3.50 a pint, bargain and well worth going to even just the bar if you fancy a bevvie! The last night we ate at Belle Notte which is a Lady and the Tramp themed counter service place in the disney park. It was 12 euros for an adult which was for a large pizza, drink, bowl of green salad and a yoghurt. The childrens meal was 5.99 euros and they had a main meal drink and pudding, I would definitely recommend this place if you are watching the pennies as you get a lot for your money. On the last day we went to mcdonalds before we returned home. This was good value, around 20 euros for us all to eat although there are BIG queues there so be prepared to wait. There is a new place just opened called the earl of sandwich which of course sells sandwiches and even though we didn't eat in there the prices are good and the food looked good. A lot of the food is fast food unless you want to pay a fortune but you can get salads, even in mcdonalds so not quite as bad as everyone is saying plus you can take a load of apples etc with youNow, we spent around 300 euros on our 3 night 4 day trip which I thought was good and the only reason we spent that much was because when we realised how little we were spending we bought a bottle of wine from the hotel at around 16 euros (much cheaper than buying by the glass) and had a few beers on the last day.A big tip. We took a quite large holdall that was full of stuff to keep us going. We had pringles, popcorn, nuts, biscuits, snacks, fruit, squash, a travel kettle (as you have to hire them), teabags, long life milk, sandwich bags, and a bottle of wine for the evening once the children were asleep! This was a life saver. Basically we ate our breakfast at the hotel and then went and got a tray full of croissants, cheese, ham, rolls and pain au chocolate and made our lunch and put them in sandwich bags. We took the sandwiches along with various snacks for in the park. We didn't need to buy any food in the park at all. It's nonsense that you can't take food in, they only check your bags for security reasons not to take food off you. We also took 4 plastic bottles, put in some squash each morning and then filled them up at the water fountains, there are loads of them about. The only food we bought was our evening meal. Call me tight but it saved us so much money, we never ran out of food!All in all I would definitely recommend disney. We had a fantastic time even though we were exhausted! Just make sure you do your research, find out about ride closures, menus and prices, take lots of food with you, make lunch from your breakfast in your hotel, take your own drinks, use disney magic hours and the fast pass system and just enjoy it! Don't walk round searching for things such as cracks in the pavements as some have mentioned on here, it isn't really worth worrying about, there are more enjoyable things to do than thatEnjoy!",Disneyland_Paris
113414500,4,2011-4,United Kingdom,"Went for our sons 10th birthday with another couple, and their 17 year old daughter.We arent into theme parks and my husband hates queuing etc and not into rides so were really going for our son.Stayed Sat night and had sat in disney and sunday at the Studio tour.Son thoroughly enjoyed startours,small world (despite his age) pirates of the caribbean etc. Scared silly as was I by Escape from Thunder mountain but there were much younger all around who had enjoyed it.Our friends really into very scary rides etc.Felt there was a lot to do even if you were not into big rides (unlike at Legoland etc)Yes long queues on more popular rides but you have tto expect it. For me could have done without the over hour queue for Thunder mountain...especially as didnt like it. Probably should have got a fast track ticket though.The queue for star wars adds to the ride as there are things to see as you queue.Food exspensive but you expect that. Despite some reports you could get coffee etc and smaller snacks that weerent just burgers.For lunch we had decent fish and chips at toad hall. We then left our friends in the eve who enjoyed cafe mickey while we bought ok sandwich at station and went back to Santa Fe.Disappointments. My friend who had booked it had been told we should be able to go to central Hall on arrival to book a birthday cake to be eaten at an arranged restaurant and to also get a disney birthday badge for my son and the entertainers would be able to make a fuss of him.On arrival at City hall we were told they had run out of badges and you couldnt book a cake without a character meal (we were having character breakfast sun morning so didnt want both meals) They then said well we could go over to the studios at end of the day and see if they had any cakes left!!So our son in fact had candles on his pudding when we ate in Montmartre after our transfer to Paris on birthday eve on sunday.Sunday.Character breakfast Disney Village Cafe Mickey. Excellent breakfast, our son and even 17 year old thrilled with characters.Disney Studio tour. Great. Backlot tour, car stunt display and cinemagique were great favourites though son preferred Disney.All in all Son loved it. and even my husband said  Not as awful  as he was expecting. Praise indeed. Loved Disney studios Cinemagique.Weather baking hot whiole we were there and we could have done with somewhere to buy sun tan lotion. Not sure if we missed it amongst the excessive number of disney toy stores.We travelled from Charles De Gaulle airport using fantastic transfer service who also transferred us to paris and then back to airport. As there were 5 of us it was worth doing .Eazy Shuttle transfer. Very elegant lady very nice shoes!! She drove us to an atm at arrival at Marne Sur Valle then to hotel santa Fe.When we left Disney on the sunday she met us at gates and took us back to hotel to collect luggage then into paris. a great way to arribve in the city.",Disneyland_Paris
113215363,4,2011-6,United Kingdom,"We were very lucky to go to Disneyland Paris the week after half term. The queues were not too bad and in some cases (Space Mountain being an example) there were sometimes no queues at all. Rides to suit all ages   we just had to do the teacup ride despite the children being a bit old for that kind of thing! The Studio was disappointing   when you stay in a resort hotel you can go in 2 hours early, but nothing was open! They also had technical problems so quite a few of the rides weren't operating until later in the day. The shows were fun, we liked Stitch Live. We stayed in the Sequoia Hotel   I've read mixed reviews but actually it was fine, although there was major refurbishment going on, this didn't bother us as we were out all day. The worst thing was the price of the food   many people had taken advantage of the half board offer, but we just did bed and breakfast and ate in MacDonalds and the Earl of Sandwich (fantastic hot sandwiches, believe me!). We had one eat all you can buffet at the Cantina   never again. I would not go to DLP in peak season, I think it would be unbearable.",Disneyland_Paris
113183230,4,2011-6,France,"We live in the area and have annual passes so we get to go a lot. If you are visiting Paris, you may not know that you can buy a  Billet Francilien  though you don't actually have to live in the area. The current special is valid until September 13. You chose the day you want to go, at least 5 days in advance and then you can go back for a 2nd free visit 7 days later. The price is    30 for one park on a weekday and    40 for the weekend for a child or an adult. Two parks cost    40 for a weekday and    50 for the weekend. Because we have the annual pass, we often hop parks based on the lines. But if I was a tourist, I would stay in one park one day and then do the other park the second day. Here is the link:http:  www.billetfrancilien.com Two other helpful things to know:You are allowed to carry in back packs with snacks and drinks. We do this each time. Also, there is a free iPhone app from Disneyland Paris that lists all the shows and line waiting times. Be sure to get the official Disney app. It's free, but there is more than one app and we have found the others to be inaccurate. If I was visiting Paris and felt like I had to pack it all in on one day, I don't know if I would like it as much. I know the French school holidays and we don't go on those days. Many French kids don't have school on Wednesday (like my boys) so avoid those days if you can as well. If you have to go on a weekend, I would choose Sunday over Saturday.",Disneyland_Paris
112939140,5,2011-6,United Kingdom,"Just returned from DLP. Went with my husband and 2 children aged 7 and 5. Had read the reviews before we went and so had done research and studied the park map to ensure I knew where the rides we wanted to go on were, which we could Fastpass and which rides were open early for Disney Hotel Guests. We were there on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Thursday & Friday there parks were not too crowded, the queues were around 15 20 mins for Buzz Lightyear, Star Tours, Big Thunder Montain, Peter Pan. We maximised our Fastpasses, queued for some rides and got on all the rides we wanted to go on. In the Studios Rock n Rollercoaster was closed but our kids weren't big enough for that anyway so we weren't bothered. The only ride that had a large 45 minute queue was Crushes Coaster.On the Saturday it was a different story, the park was so crowded and queues were around an hour for all the main rides so we fastpassed and got on some rides and watched the Tarzan show which was fab, went to the 3D cinema show in Discoveryland, let the kids play in Adventure Isle which was great.All in all we loved our visit, during the 3 days we were there we went on Buzz Lightyear 3 or 4 times, Big Thunder Mountian 7 times, Tower of Terror twice and practically all the other rides at least once. My advice would be plan ahead, use Fast passes and visit during the week if you can and you will have a wonderful time.",Disneyland_Paris

Luckily the weather was beautiful ideal for an outdoor attraction, otherwise I could imagine it would have cost a lot of money to keep the children entertained.The food and drink is very expensive, however you could save money by taking a number of snacks & drinks. Be prepared for long ques and where possible get fast track tickets and come back to rides. We had a really good time, but were glad we were only there for 1 day.

We stayed off sight this time which was good. When we drove in we didn't park in the main car park (I do think 15 euros is a ripoff just to park your car) but parked at the station   worked out a bit cheaper and if youre not planning on staying the full day could be fair bit cheaper. It's also closer to walk to the parks too. We used to bring in some sandwiches and snacks each day   although they searched your bags they didn't mind. A lot of people did this and as long as you didn't sit in the cafes and restaurants eating your sandwiches they didn't seem to mind. We also kept water and coke in the freezer at our accommodation and this defrosted during the day but meant we had a good supply of ice cold water and coke.We spent a total of 2 days in the park and although both bank holidays in France did everything except Dumbo. Made good use of fastpass and the staff were very organised at getting people on and off the rides to keep the queues moving often quicker than the wait times. Staff very friendly and attentive, rides still great and pleanty of characters milling around for photos. Souvenirs and food generally expensive but there are some things to buy which aren't too badly priced but most toys you'll find cheaper in the Disney Store in the UK.

There are dozens of spectacular rides and attractions but they're not signposted and you need to be able to read the map. You also need to get fastpasses for the popular rides and turn up at 8am to beat the queues. Do this and you'll have a superb visit. If you go on a busy day and just wonder around hoping to find some fun, you'll fail!For small kids try It's a Small World, other boat rides and the train rides. For slightly older or braver kids go for Buzz Lightyear Lazerblast, Pirates of the Caribbean, then for roller coasters start with Thunder mountain and also go to the Studios park for RC racer and Crush's coaster. For food you need to be smart and plan in advance as the fast food in the park is not great. Hotel restaurants are better. Disney village restaurants are pricey but there's some choice.

Short feedback: This was the WORST experience we have ever had bar none at a park and it was 10X the price of some of the regional parks we visit all the time in the DC area. For starters there are really on 7 8 rides in the WHOLE place. The rides are super short   the merry go round went for 2 minutes!!!!!!!! We timed it. Took 1 hour to get on, 5 minutes for them to load us and in 2 minutes we were off! Second everything has a LONG line ... at least 90 minutes. The rides also suck! They are not that interesting...

There are so many things to do from shows to rides. We did as many things as possible but could have done with a few extra days to finish off!! We thought the parade was brilliant and the meet and greet was fab to. They never rushed you and you are more than welcome to take your own photos as well as having professional ones taken. We thought the toilets were clean and all the staff we came into contact with were fine. My kids loved the Buzz Lightyear ride the best but the stunt show was fab too. The only small thing that spoils it is that it is very expensive to eat and drink there. If the prices were reduced slightly they would sell more in the end. I don't mind paying but I want quality which is something I did not get in one restaurant. I suppose it is Disney after all. We took small empty bottles into the park and filled them with water from the fountains which was fine and I took boxes of cereal bars in case we were hungary in between meals.

111489166,5,2011-5,United States,"We have just returned from our 1st trip to Disneyland Paris and had a brilliant time. After reading so many terrible reviews I will admit that I was worried, however I need not have been. I had read about dirty parks and filthy toilets, rude staff and nothing to do for younger children   all totally wrong. The Parks were spotlessly clean, they were obviously hosed down each morning before visitors arrived and on numerous occasions I saw staff lifting litter or just brushing up. The grounds are immaculate. The toilets are no better or worse than any other public toilets I have ever used and it is hardly Disney's fault if visitors dont flush the toilets! All staff were friendly, polite and curteous and when greeted with a smile and some manners, were more than helpful.There are refurbishments happening all around the park, but all work is hidden from sight and in no way detracts from the whole atmosphere.There are more than enough rides and events to keep younger children amused. Our youngest is only 10.5 months and she went on Buzz Lightyear Lazer Blast numerous times, Pirates of the Carribean, Snow White, Peter Pan, The Carousel and Mad Hatter Tea Cups. Our son is 3.5 and he also went on all the above but also on Dumbo, Flying Carpets, Phantom Manor. There are also numerous shows in the Studios that will entertain any young child.I had also read reviews were people complained about the queue times, what do they expect? This is probably the most popular theme park in Europe!! Use FASTPASS, the amount of time spent queing is drastically reduced when you use fastpass, plan what rides you want to go on and when you can use fastpass for them, simple.Dont let negative reviews put you off going to Disneyland Paris, its a beautiful place with a surprise around every corner.

Use FastPass if the ride offers it   dramatically cuts down on wait times.

110723942,5,2010-6,India,I visited Paris during my summer internship and got the opportunity to spend a day at the wonderful disneyland! There were so many things to do at Disneyland that 1 whole day certainly didnt prove to be enough! There were 3 4 different types of roller coasters running at lighteneing speeds with some having space  universe theme in them. There was a march in the evening with lines of kids and lovely disney characters mingling with the visitors. And who can forget the surprising 4 D movie where theatre itself had special effects and one couldn't help but get startled when water spray comes on your face suddenly when it was supposed to be happening in the movie!Disneyland is a must go place for anyone who visits Paris. It offers something or other to the people of all age groups.,Disneyland_Paris
110706227,5,2011-5,United Kingdom,"brilliant day, visted both parks in two days due to time restraints, would reccommend a day for each park really. As always all the staff were brilliant, the cast member playing minnie mouse was especially kind to my 3 year old sister. Cant wait to return :)",Disneyland_Paris
110703468,5,2011-5,United Kingdom,"I was a little reluctant about taking my two kids (4 yrs and 2 yrs) to Disneyland Paris, thinking it would be a sub par version of the American attractions.I was wrong. The parks were well laid out, clean, with nice staff and an absolutely amazing experience for me, my wife and the kids   memories made! Not sure what the previous person is talking about when saying the parks are dirty   all I saw on the floor was the very occassional leaf and no litter at all. It's fair to say that the food is expensive   expect to pay about 4 euros for a coke. The food isn't great as previously stated by others and isn't all that veggie friendly. I'd advise you visit The Rainforest Cafe in the Disney Village for dinner as that's where we ate most of the time. it has a great interior for kids with moving animals on the walls and the occassional sounds of a thunderstorm complete with lighting to entertain them. We paid about 80 Euros for two main courses, 6 sides and 6 drinks   expensive but not too extortionate!Also, I've seen a few people complaining about the shuttle busses being really busy   they're like an average journey on the London Underground and you're on it for about 5 minutes (or we were, at the Dream Castle Hotel).Speaking of which, I couldn't really fault the Dream Castle Hotel, we are pretty choosy when it comes to hotels and never go lower than 4 stars   the Dream Castle was nice and clean, good sized rooms and nice grounds. Few people have moaned on here about the breakfast being cold but we didn't have any problems. The only thing cold was the 'heated' indoor swimming pool which was bloody freezing! Used it once and the temperature put us off. Would have been bearable if the jacuzzi had been working but, alas, it was not.To summarise   go for it, you'll have a great time! Just be prepared for the cost of eating drinking. Also, we didn't take a pushchair and opted to just hire from the park. Costs about 8 Euros per day. They pushchairs are quite heavy and clunky   rusty wheels and some of the chairs are torn   request a good one and the staff will get you a nicer one, but if you can bring your own cheap little fold up pushchair you're better off as the rentals don't look comfy and there had been times where we hired one at around 11.00am and there were only a few left!",Disneyland_Paris
110666800,4,2011-5,United Kingdom,"I have to admit that from a personal perspective I came at this from a glass half empty perspective. However, whilst I still retain a certain abhorrence for cradle to grave marketing 'the disney machine' I have to 'go with the flow' and do you know what   it can be such fun !We have just spent the last 3 days at Disneyland Paris (28 30th May). We took the 0946 train out of St P on Saturday and left Disney @ 0734 Monday and were blessed with warm sunny days   as per a previous review, drinking lots of water, wearing sunscreen and hats for kids are essential. Hotel......We stayed at the Disneyland Paris Hotel which is right at the front entrance. Great hotel, breakfast in 'Inventions' was excellent and characters milling around at breakfast time and early afternoon makes for relaxed autograph opportunities for kids where in the park it can be a bit of a scrum. There are no tea coffee making facilities and the mini bar is 'trop cher'   8Euros for a 330ml can of Kron 1664. Prior to going we had pre booked 'Half Board Premium' vouchers (highly recommended) and so had an evening meal in 'Inventions' in our hotel. This was far and away the best food we had in our stay with excellent seafood (juicy prawns, crab claws, langoustines), carved meat (changed every 10mins and saw lamb racks, rib of beef, sirloin) and lovely tasty fresh veg to accompany. Plus with Mickey, Minnie, Chip n Dale and Goofy popping by to say hello it was a jaw dropping evening for our 2 girls.Hotel overall score   9 10Evening Meals   LunchesAside from the meal above we had three other 'eating out' experiences ;Day 2 Lunch with Princesses @ Auberge de Cendrillon (6 10)Nice food, we saw Cinderella, Belle, Ariel and another one (sorry....I have 2 daughters but as a Dad the exact names are not that important   but she was a high ranking one anyway). Service was slow and our friends who we travelled with made 2 observations as they had had this same experience the year before. (1) The 'Princess Picture' that is taken on arrival and then brought to you at your table was FREE a year ago but now they try and charge you 25Euros. (2) There were less Princesses and less dances in the centre of the restaurant. Finally, one child had a birthday and the cake was brought to the table with 'staff' singing happy birthday and with no Princesses there at all   what an anti climax that must have been for the family !Day 2 Evening Meal at Planet Hollywood (1 10)Food was 'HORRIFIC'. The Burger bun was the cheapest one money can buy, the burger itself was average, the cheese plastic and that was just mine. 4 Adults, 4 Children with 1 bottle of wine and 4 Kron 1664     200 !!! Service was reasonable but aside from the pleasure of seeing Depeche Mode on the TV's, we could have had better food at McDonalds and paid 75% less (can't believe I have just suggested McDonalds!)Day 3 Lunch at Cafe Mickey (3 10)You have to view this as 2 component parts   the Cafe gets 9 10 for the theatre of the characters constantly coming around for hugs and pictures plus 4 tables had a birthday celebration and the staff coming out clapping and shouting 'Happy Birthday' to 3 alternating musical tracks was pretty exciting and with the characters then all going to the table for pictures etc   this is probably to be recommended for children (although the best 'surprised expression' probably went to a 70yr old lady on the table next to us as her face was a lovely picture). Food and service would have to get 2 10. I had a Lasagne which was terrible and my wife had a salad that needed to take swimming lessons to get out of the dressing. The problem (I think) with the number of 'Happy Birthdays' that you get is that staff are not doing their actual job very well   requests for another drink etc take 10mins don't come at all and the staff were very indifferent at odds with the 'smiley' world of Disney. Prices are 'SKY HIGH' also   200Euros for lunch for the 8 of us.The ParksReally enjoyed it. Lots of rides that appeal to thrill seekers and little ones alike. Our family favourite was 'Thunder Mountain' in Frontierland and having a Dad Daughter shared experience was a 'moment' for me and is to be highly recommended. The only tip I would make would be to try and schedule in some use of your ticket's 'FASTPASS' capability   you can use your entrance ticket in the Fast Pass machines to reserve a place in the queue for later (you can also pre book fast passes). The times of these are displayed above the machines. The Parade was great for children and we saw this twice and I think I will have the 'It's just like a dream' and the bells that precede 'when you wish upon a star' songs imprinted in my brain permanently now. We also used the Strollers. They are pricey 8.95Euros Day but with kids burning off so much energy in excitement alone   busy crowds it worked for us in getting about smoothly managing energy levels as little ones can also have a nap in them.",Disneyland_Paris
110519324,5,2010-7,United Kingdom,"When we arrived at the park there were hardly any queues and the bag search was quick and easy. As soon as you are inside you are greeted with disney music and brilliant theming which starts the day off great. The park has a monoral which can take you around the park however, not being too huge, we walked everywhere and found this was the best way to see everything. The park was well kept, tidy, and although busy at parts, the staff handled crowding well. We came here for 4 days and think it was the best holiday we could have gone on. We really enjoyed everything and will definitely be coming back.The food was excellent, and although it is a little pricey, you can't really expect anything less from a huge company like Disney. We ate in the Village at Planet Hollywood and Rainforest, however in the park we had hot dogs and some of the Mickey donuts which were very yummy. We also had meal deals at the Mexican in Adventureland which was great value for money and very tasty. The parades are every few hours, and although it gets very busy, you can always find somewhere to watch it.You will always find a character walking about to sign autographs and have photos with. The queues were not too bad, however for some of the popular ones, when you get in the park you should take advantage of the free fasttrack service as this was really useful in not wasting our day.The best rides we went on were Pirates of the Caribbean, and Indiana Jones, Space Mountain and Buzz Lightyear! Shops are everywhere and sell the same sort of things, however, it can be a bit pricey but again, no more expensive than UK disney stores, with a wide range of teddies and clothing etc to suit everyones budget.We bought a leather photo book for 25 euros which was excellent quality, although we didnt buy many of the ride photos as they were a bit over priced in our opinion.This is a great place to visit if you love Disney but cannot afford to go to Florida, and for a few days stay is just as good.Please dont pay attention to the people really putting the park down. Ive read through alot and we experienced none of these problems. Every staff member was happy to help or direct us and yes the park is expensive but you really do get what you pay for here. We would really recommend the rain forest cafe for dinner as the food was great and had a wide variety and the theme was really entertaining.We have been to florida disneyworld and yes its alot smaller and maybe not as good but not everyone can afford to go florida. We still found our stay to be excellent and enjoyable.",Disneyland_Paris
110141311,3,2011-4,United Kingdom,"Our three year old son loved Disneyland and Walt Disney Studios. We had three days to explore and enjoy the Disney experience. Surprisingly, I found it relaxing and a good way to unwind. Walt Disney Studios is great on a wet day as there is so much to do inside. The Fast pass is excellent and saves queueing up for the big rides.However, there were some downsides:1. There are smokers everywhere and none of them respect the smoking ban at Disneyland   the designated smoking areas were empty! We got smoke in our faces whilst queueing for rides, walking around and whilst sitting outside restaurants. Disney just refuses to enforce its own rules. Not good enough   this is a park for kids after all.2. The food is expensive and not very good. We found that the Relay shop at the train station (just outside the parks) is good for drinks and picnics etc.3. Three or four of the big rides were closed for our entire stay.",Disneyland_Paris
110066682,4,2011-5,United Kingdom,"After having visited Disneyland Paris at least 20 times in the past year, I have come to realize that the secret to having a good time there is as much about knowing what NOT TO DO as knowing what to do. So, one of the first things I tell people not to do is over schedule themselves and their families. One must reign in one's expectations. You cannot do 20 rides in one day. It is unlikely you will be able to do 10. Even if the park is completely empty, it is HUGE and it takes quite a bit of time to walk from point A to point B, particularly on the Magic Kingdom side. Most people really don't take this into consideration. For example, if you get a Fast Pass for the Buzz Lightyear ride and then think you will just nip on over to the Pirates of the Caribbean while you wait, you may be in for a nasty surprise. These things are quite a distance from each other, and if P.O.C has any line at all, you might not make it. Personally, I consider it a really good day if we can go on 4 rides and see a couple of shows. Once you throw in lunch, that is a very full day...believe me. But it never fails that once people get in the park, they start rushing around with manic expressions and twitching eyes. Don't torture yourself. It is better to do fewer things (and enjoy them) than to try to squeeze in everything and make everyone miserable. But, if you are going to go on fewer rides or attractions, you need to make those rides  count ...meaning that your family leaves the ride having had a good experience. With that in mind, I thought I would share some of the rides that you will probably want to avoid if you have younger kids and want to enjoy your day...or if you want to sleep that night. This comes from my own hard won experience and stupidity, so someone might as well get some benefit from that. I will split this up into the  sides  of the Park to make it easier for you once you get to the Park.Walt Disney Studios Side1) Armageddon: Les Effets SpeciauxOK, one would think that with the word  Armageddon  in the title, any halfway intelligent person would know to avoid this with a young child. What can I say? Sometimes I am an idiot. To my defense, I will say that Disney did not help me on this one. The first thing to throw me off was that Disney labels this ride with a blue dot, which means  Family Adventures . So,  good for the whole family , I naively thought. Second, on their park map, this attraction got one of their little yellow exclamation marks. The legend says that this means that the attraction  may frighten younger guests . But when I benchmarked this, some of the other attractions that got this marking were Snow White, Pinocchio, and Pirates of the Caribbean. Yes, these are a bit scary for the under 3 set, but Seb went on all of them before the age of 2 and was fairly OK. The last excuse I can come up with is that there is an actual warning on this ride that says  Unsuitable for children under the age of 1  They said  1 , so I figured 2 1 2 is more than twice as old as 1. I assumed that all would be well. Uh, no. Not so much. For the record, this ride should be labeled as  Unsuitable for children under the age of 8, pregnant women, those who are claustrophobic, those who are afraid of the dark, and any adult who doesn't want to get wet, cried on or both . So, what happens? The attraction sets up with everyone in a small room watching a video screen with a scene from the movie Armageddon. It would be a little scary for kids who are skittish but both of mine were OK. Then the  director  tells you that you are  actors  for the day, so you must  act scared . Lucas, our 5 year old, found this annoying. Seb, our 2 year old, was a bit freaked out but more in an apprehensive way than in a scared way. Turns out he was smarter than Mom on that count. After you see the movie, then they herd you on to  the set . This is where I realized that this was a big mistake, but couldn't find an easy way out of it at that point. Besides, I thought, they said  not suitable for under 1 , how bad can it be. Pretty bad. Apparently this ride is designed to manufacture the special effects of the movie, and it does....right in front of you. There are explosions that shake the ground, alarms, fire shooting up from the floor to the ceiling and  sprinklers  going off after the fact. Seb FREAKED. Even Lucas kind of freaked, and he is usually impervious. Poor little Seb was screaming  too scary, too scary  as he clung to Dad. Julien ended up just covering his eyes. I felt like a total monster, because I hadn't seen that it would be this bad. Luckily, it didn't last for long, and Seb forgot it within minutes of leaving. I, on the other hand, will keep the mental picture for months, if not years, to come. And I got what I so richly deserved because he woke up several times that night with nightmares, and I ended up having to sleep with him. What goes around comes around. 2) Twilight Zone Tower of TerrorI know I must seem like a totally negligent parent, because I would take my kindergartener on a ride with the name  Tower of Terror , but you have to understand Lucas. Yes, he is 5. But he is a fearless 5. He loves ALL roller coasters, which cover the gamete from  Casey Jr.  le Petite Train du Cirque  to  Aerosmith's Rock and Roll Roller Coaster , the latter of which is now his  favorite  ride at Disney. Plus he has never had problem with  drop  rides. In fact, he found the Toy Story  Parachute Drop  a bit boring. So, not only is he tall enough to go on these rides, he is mature enough. But this is part of the problem with the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. The problem came from the  set up  and not the ride itself.This ride is your typical  drop  ride. You are taken to a  room  where you sit and put on the requisite seatbelts. It is set up in movie theatre type seating, with roughly 10 people in a  row  that is split one or two ways. This is to say that you can sit next to your child. You can even put your arm around them. I should point out that this ride is designated a  big thrill  on the map, so you are alerted that it is not for very young kids. But the ride has a height restriction (1.02M), which isn't really that tall. It also has nothing in terms of a  frightening young children  sort of warning. But I guess they figure you are smart enough to figure that one out, given the name and all. But for Lucas, if the fear had been the drop, it would have been no problem at all. While, they  drop  you several floors and it really does have the  stomach in the mouth  effect, Lucas barely reacted to it. He told me later that he was still  scared  about what happened during the wait to get on this ride. So what happens in the wait? Well, while you are waiting, they tell you a story about how a family once disappeared while in the elevator you are about to go on. And, of course, they ended up in  the Twilight Zone  . Then they show a video where it looks like the family is  getting hit by lightening , to quote Lucas. When I explained to him that this was not real lightening and it was just a made up story, he seemed OK with it, but he got really quiet. As I said, this quiet extended to the drop part of the ride itself. So much so that my friend Josephine, who had joined us on this ride, was concerned because Lucas didn't scream or anything during the drop. He was too busy worrying about the lost family. We had lots of discussions about it after the fact, but let this be a warning to those of you with kids who are big for their age. Don't be fooled just because your child meets the height requirement. That being said, I just had a friend take her 5 year old, and he had a great time. So all kids are different. 3) Studio Tram Tour: Behind the MagicThis one pissed me off. I am ready to except the blame of not paying enough attention on both the  Tower of Terror  and  Armageddon  because, as I mentioned, the names should have clued me in to a potential problem. Yes, that was stupid. Yes, I was an idiot. But on the Studio Tram Tour, Disney drops the ball in terms of notification. This one also has a blue dot, meaning  family adventure . It then goes on to say that  guests may get splashed . Ok, this which makes one think of some nice little log flume ride. There are no little exclamation points indicating that it might be frightening. There are no  unsuitable for  warnings. If you have time to read the small explanation, which most of us don't, it says  A fascinating trip into the Studios backlot gets livened up by a visit to an action packed film shoot in Catastrophe Canyon . This might have been a bit of a heads up if I had read it before getting on. But, if you have been to Disney, you know how likely it is that you will be able to read the fine print when you are trying to juggle two kids who are both wanting to be entertained... NOW. So there you are, with all the Toy Story Playland rides clocking waits of 45 minutes or more, and at least another 30 minutes before an appropriate show starts (see Cinemagique below). So, suddenly you see that there is little to no wait for the Studio Tram Tour. You do a quick scan at the map for restrictions or little warning exclamation points. Nope. . So you get on, thinking  it can't be that bad?  Well, think again, my brothers and sisters...at least if you have kids under the age of 6 or so.This tour starts out gently enough, with driving through memorabilia from a variety of movies, stuff from Star Wars 1, Star Wars 2 etc etc. However, when you get to the  Catastrophe Canyon  part of the ride, it all goes to hell in a hand basket. Before I tell you what happens, I should tell you that the tram you are riding in is open on both sides. It does have  doors  that are high enough to contain your kids, should they try to flee, but you are open to the elements. This is important because it gives you the feeling of being  exposed . Once you get to the  Canyon , you see a tanker sitting on what looks like mountainous terrain. Suddenly, there seems to be some sort of earthquake, which shakes everything, including your car. After this, the tanker and several barrels of  gasoline  explode. If this was not bad enough, you then hear the rumbling sound of water, and what looks like a flood comes tumbling down from the top of the  mountain , directly at you. It ends up going under the car, but it is realistic and you do get wet. So you can imagine Sebastien's reaction to this. As an adult, it was interesting, if a bit jarring. But for a kid, this was extremely scary. (OK, Lucas wasn't scared, but he isn't a good benchmark for this) Seb was shaking, crying and clinging to Dad. So, not a  family  choice unless your entire family is over the age of 8 or so, and no one is particularly skittish...or you are just masochistic. 4) Cinemagique: The Disney map gives you NO real information about what this is. There are no age restrictions, no height restrictions, and no warnings of any kind. It is set in a theatre, where you will ostensibly see a  movie . But once you are inside and watching the film, you hear a cell phone ring. Then a member of the audience walks on to the stage, talking on his phone the whole time. It ends of that this person (who is Martin Short in the film) is transported into the movie. Here he finds a lost love and stumbles his way around in a variety of clips from different movies. So, what's wrong with this? Some of these movies are actually rated  R , and it has captured some extremely scary movie moments. They show Titanic, the Godfather, and a plethora of action films. Hell, it even included the pea soup scene from the Exorcist...need I say more? In addition to all this, it is really not that great to begin with, so you won't miss much by skipping it. Disney, this one needs a re do. Magic Kingdom Side5) Pirates of the Caribbean: This ride is also  blue dotted  as a  Family Adventure . It also has one of those little yellow caution exclamation point thingies. This is a weird one because what I think is disturbing about it is NOT necessarily the things that are overt...and are probably more of a problem for slightly older children than the really young ones. For example, Sebastien was OK on this ride, if a little wary. It is a dark ride. There are pirates. At times, it is a bit loud. There are some scary looking skeletons at the end....but nothing any more scary than typical Halloween fare. So, while it is unlikely that Seb would scream to go on it again, it wasn't a trauma either. With Lucas, however, we had other issues. Some of these may stem from the fact that this is an  old  ride and times and sensibilities have changed. For example, the  pirate town  part of the ride shows drunken pirates lolling around. There is a very sexy looking female character being chased by a less than attractive male character. There is a fairly unattractive female character chasing a male character with a frying pan. All of these could provide fertile ground for uncomfortable questions, if you kid has an inquiring mind. But the worst was a scene where it looks like a man is auctioning off women. Yes, it is a sale. So, during the ride, Lucas leans over to me and says  Mom, why is that man selling those women? Can you buy women? . Try fending off that question. I think I blew over it with a  oh, they are just being funny honey...OH LOOK it's a donkey , or something like that. But be aware that there is some serious sexual stereotyping and weirdness associated with this ride. The younger ones won't be savvy enough to notice, but don't underestimate your kindergartener. Enough said.6) Alice's Curious Labyrinth: During the winter, when there is almost no one at Disneyland, this can be very fun. BUT, when there is a crowd, I would steer clear of this one. This is actually a fairly new learning for me because I had not gone when it was crowded until just recently. This meant that in our previous visits to this attraction, I could keep a clear line of site to my kids. But, on this day I was not so lucky. Before we were even 4 feet into the Labyrinth, there went both my boys....running full tilt into a maze full of people. The good news is that there is only one entrance and one exit. The bad news is that still leaves a lot of space for them to get lost in and , unless you are naturally optimistic or popping Oxycodone, you are going to spend your time chasing after your kids or losing them. Julien found this place to be charming and said that he was quite happy that our kids were the sort to run marathons in a maze. While I can see his point, it didn't do much to reduce my blood pressure after I spent 20 minutes or so looking for them, in something just short of a blind panic. Sebastien has a great talent for finding all the things that you DIDN'T baby proof, and in less than 15 minutes. When we finally rounded them up, which took the combined efforts of 3 adults, I heaved a sigh of relief and vowed never to return on a busy day. 7) Sleeping Beauty's Castle: For all who have really young kids or easily frightened kids, you should be aware that a Dragon sleeps beneath Sleeping Beauty's castle. And no, that is not symbolism. It is an actual, (be it animatronic) dragon. There is a side entrance to this cave which says La Tani  re du Dragon. So that should give you a warning if you go into it from this particular entrance. However, you can also get into the dragon's lair via the gift shop in the castle. If you go this way, there is no notice. OK, it is dark and dank, but you wouldn't necessarily guess  dragon . Be warned that this is a fairly scary dragon, particularly if you make the connection to Maleficent...which Lucas did. I haven't taken Seb here yet, but Lucas was all questions after going.  Who chained Maleficent down in that cave?  and  Why would they do that?  were just a couple. But he ended this line of questioning with  Maybe she is bad because she is mad at them for making her stay in a cave all the time . Points to the 5 year old for getting to the central question. Maybe he should collaborate with Tim Burton on the upcoming revamp of Sleeping Beauty. At any rate, make sure you don't stumble upon this place because you are trying to make a fast escape from the gift shop noose. If your kids are small, you are likely to regret it. 8) Blanche Neige et les Sept Nains: This is the Snow White ride. And Disneyland does get the  exclamation mark . But it is easy to ignore this if you have never been on the ride. There's no height restriction. It is in Fantasyland, right next to the carousel, for god's sake. And it's Snow White, she of  one day my Prince will come  fame. But let's not forget that she is also the Snow White who gets poisoned by a witch and falls into a coma. And it is this element of the story that seems more prevalent on this ride. I mean, more than fifty percent of the ride being taken up with images of the witch. I find it creepy. Sebastien doesn't cry on it but looks a bit shocked when we come out at the end, which is why I have stopped taking him on it. If you have a young child or a sensitive older child, don't do it...no matter how short the line. Yes, the lines are shorter than Peter Pan....but there is a reason.9) Les Voyages des Pinocchio: This falls into the same creepy category as Snow White. Dark. Scary. With a giant whale that jumps out at you with teeth bared. Who thought this was good for little kids?? Obviously someone who didn't have to deal with the nightmares afterward. This is the sort of thing that makes me wonder about Walt. But I won't go there. 10) Phantom Manor: This also falls into the  family adventure  category. And it rightly has one of the exclamation thingies. But this is a good ride. No, I would venture to say that this is a really good ride...if your kid can handle it. But there are lots of things here that are not for the under 3 set. When you enter the  Manor , everyone in line gets crammed into a room that seems to start sinking. On the walls of said room are paintings that appear normal to begin with but take on creepy or surrealist qualities when the bottom of them are revealed. Once you get to the bottom, a door opens on one side and you wander through a hall with some fairly creepy, and sometimes disturbing, paintings. After this you get into cars that take you through the haunted house. Once in the cars, you encounter some very realistic looking ghosts, a head floating in mid air and some very scary skeletons. But probably the scariest bit comes with some mirror work at the end of the ride. Your car is turned around to face a mirror, where you see not only yourself, but a demon thing on the top of your car. It's a little freaky even for adults. Lucas likes this ride, but his normally fearless first girlfriend, Grace, was disturbed. AddendumAs one final note, I should add that if you have concerns about a particular ride, you can ask the staff at DLP what they think. You can also ask them if you have the option of bailing out once you are on the attraction. Some are easier to get out of than others. For example, I probably could have gotten us out of the Armageddon thing if I had tried hard enough but in something like the Tram Tour, you are basically SOL. This is something to consider if you are  testing out  a ride. The good news is that most attractions don't last more than 3 to 5 minutes. The bad news is that 3 to 5 minutes can feel like an eternity when your child is frightened and crying.Oh, and for those who might be concerned that Seb and Lucas might be traumatized by all of the above...not to worry. We did not do all these things on the same day, it was spread out over multiple visits. And, as I mentioned above, Lucas is fearless and often the one pushing for any new experience. I tend to have to reign him in quite a bit. And Sebastien, well, he is a little tank. Plus, he is quite capable of letting me know what he likes and doesn't like. So when we get to Disneyland, he has usually told me what he wants to do, and in no uncertain terms. All that being said, when they DO get scared at something, I pay the price with nightmares the evening following one of these things. So my motivation for sharing all this with other parents is so that you can avoid making unnecessary mistakes. Or at least be a bit more prepared if you choose to take a risk. Lastly, it should go without saying that all kids are different. The experiences I have with my kids will be different from the ones you have with your kids. For this reason, I have tried to give you the reasons that these rides should give you pause. Now go, have fun, and let me know if any of you are brave enough to go see the  Moteurs  stunt show.

109880910,1,2011-3,United Kingdom,"My 4 year old made the comment tonight (over two months after visiting Disneyland Paris) after seeing a DP television commercial:  They don't know how dirty it is. Cold day with people wearing heavy coats and hats and the lines were 90 minutes or more for all rides. We rode one ride and the choo choo and nothing else. We used the Fast Pass at 12:45 and we received tickets for 6:45 at night. Fast Pass? The bathroom facilities were absolutely disgusting: run down, flooded and soiled with 10 15 minute waits to use a toilet...not a big deal as my son's 4 year old bladder is very patient. This park is an embarrassment to the Disney name. Be forewarned, this park is only renting the Disney name and tries to mimic it with a similar layout and rides but is in no way a comparison for Disney Orlando.Oh, and it only cost us    160 for three to get in for this lovely experience. A tour of the sewers of Paris would have been a better experience...at least they're honestly named.",Disneyland_Paris
109860400,5,2011-5,United Kingdom,"we have recently returned from our first disneyland experience.we booked for our daughters 3rd birthday. we booked 3 nights 4 days in disney hotel cheyenne. we caught the eurostar from ashford at 6.57am on monday morning had a 59 min wait in lille then got off the train outside the disneyland gates at 11.15. the free shuttle buses were outside every. 2 3 minutes to take you to the hotels. check in was straight forward , the staff were excellent very helpful and spoke excellent english. the hotel was great fun, the rooms clean and themed. i had read comments that it was basic and shabby but we were impressed. it suited us , served its purpose. we were a little disappointed in the food. breakfast was the same every day bread, pain o chocolate ,crossaints, ham cheese or cereal. however this came in handy to make sandwhiches to stow away for lunch.we didnt try dinner.we had breakfast before 8 each morning so we could get to the park early. we found monday tues and wed fantastic in the parks, not too busy, we didnt have to queue too long. the disney staff were a credit to their country and to disney. however our final day...thursday the parks were heaving with french weekend visitors and we found them very rude and arrogant. we spent equal time in the main park and disney studios. there was plenty for our 3 year old to do. she went on all the rides in fantasy land and loved the new toystory section in the studios. there were plenty of characters to see around the park , sometimes we had to queue to have pictures with them. the parades were great but essential to get a roadside view early. we found the shops and restaurants very expensive. however there are plenty of drinking water fountains around the parks so you needent pay out for bottles.we found the park maps and programmes essential. we were able to plan exactly where to be at the right time and we didnt miss a thing. if you want to dine with the characters the mickey cafe in the disney village is the place to eat but book early. the experience is magical. on my daughters birthday mickey minnie goofey giney captain hook and e ore came with a cake to our table singing and dancing. they sat with us and gave plenty of cuddles. you can take as many photos with no one trying to sell you professonal ones.we took our pushchair but u can hire them there. i dont know at what cost. we left our pushchair with bags and belongings outside rides and it was never touched or moved. we used the fast pass service great where you get a ticket and return to rides at a set time and dont have to queue.one disappointment, no where offered childrens knives and forks. only adult sizes silverware. we took our own as my daughter was unable to hold them.. 3 days was plenty. the 4th day was too long. we would love to return in a few years.",Disneyland_Paris
109743740,4,2011-5,United Kingdom,"Last went to Disneyland park the year it opened and found the queuing and bad manners a real stress. Think the Europeans have now come to terms with queuing etiquite and didn't have a problem at all on this trip. We've been to Orlando a number of times and, yes, it's probably a bit better maintained but so what? We had a great time. Quite liked the different language spoken by the characters. Had lots of opportunities to meet with characters with queues not being too long. We had a great time with our 2 year old grand daughter and will definately return when her brother is a bit older.The only down side is the expense. A combination of Disney prices and a poor exchange rate made it really expensive. I know some people will disagree but I'm not sure you can do it on a budget, or should I say a low budget.",Disneyland_Paris
109522989,4,2011-5,United Kingdom,"23 May 2011The toilets were clean, and by French standards excellent. We took a picnic, and saw no objecctions from cast members (who were brilliant). It was pricey, as was legoland, so was well prepared. It was really hot (28c)and was surprised at people getting sunburnt and not wearing hats. I'm not usually a hat person but by 5 felt I was wilting. The Parade was great, wished I had listened to earleir review and chosen my kerbside spot at 4.30! one down side was watching the soldiers from toy story float nad out flags to children and then snatch them off after.We managed to do both studio and park in a day, we missed a few things, but I do feel Disneyed out. Not sure if I could have done a two day tour.We stayed at Lagny, and took the bus (no 23) to the park, it was 1E80 per person per trip. We arrived at 0915 and by the time we had bought tickets and walked to studios, queued for first ride it was 10! My sonaged 7) hated the Holywood tower hotel ride, too dark. Tried to get Tesco vouchers, would recommend to find a deal before going, we paid 200Euros for twoadults and one child.",Disneyland_Paris
109463807,5,2011-5,United Kingdom,"Just returned from a 2 night 3 day Euro disney holiday with our 4 year old little girl,and feel I should write a review after reading all the recent bad ones.We stayed at the Sequoia Lodge Hotel which was very nice. It had all the features of a lodge with log fires,hunting equiptment on the walls etc. Our room had 2 double beds,mini bar,flat screen t.v with disney channel. It didnt have a kettle etc, but we knew this so took a travel kettle and our own coffee with us, but we were'nt in the room long enough to use it! We did however put our own beers in the mini bar to keep them cold! Mini bar expensive, so beware, miniture spirit was 10 euros,can of coke 4 euros. Breakfast was continental and plenty of it, and yes, we did the same as most families, made up some rolls with ham etc, to take with us for lunch,staff seem to turn a blind eye to it as long as you dont abuse it too much.We chose to do the disney luggage express which was really good.It cost    16 per adult and was well worth it. The french staff at Ashford were really helpful. You collect labels,park tickets and food vouchers etc from them. You take your luggage on the train with you and then when you arrive the other side you simply go to the luggage express desk and hand your luggage over and go off straight to the park. On the day of your return, you hand your luggage in at the hotel and spend the day in the park, and pick it back up at the express desk at the train station.The park itself was clean and well organised. We made use of the extra hours we gained from staying at one of the disney hotels, but we were disappointed to find that only certain rides were open.You need to check beforehand as to which ones are open. Some of the rides are also closed due to repairs. We went Wednesday to Friday and found the first 2 days not too busy.Friday was very busy and brought out a lot more of the characters. Seemed a bit unfair that they weren't around when the park was quieter.We hired a stroller for our little girl which was a god send as she got tired from walking.Make sure you have comfy and 'worn in' footwear.Sun hats and suncream are a must as we caught the sun even though the queues are all under cover.Take a small empty bottle with you and make use of the water fountains situated outside each toilet block, as a small bottle of water is over    3 to buy.Two twister lollies and a cornetto was    9.95.Everything is expensive,but you expect this. We bought the half board plus vouchers for   136 for a meal for the 3 of us on both days.We had a 3 course meal and a soft drink and 2 courses and drink for children.This was cheaper than buying the same meals without the vouchers.Book your table at the restaurant you choose beforehand as people were still trying to get in to eat with small children after 10pm.We used our vouchers at the hunters grill in our hotel for a buffet.The food was tasty and plenty to choose from,well recommended. We used our second voucher for lunch at Cafe Mickey.Characters are only there certain times, so check first. Great place to meet characters one to one for photos etc. Mickey was offish when we met him here though and kept walking away from the children and standing on his own.He was more interested in messing around with one of the waiters.We mentioned this to our waitress,who by the way was lovely,and she said that he works long shifts and was probably tired! Hard to explain this to our 4 year old who was upset that he walked away and ignored her when she offered him one of her sweets! The rest of the characters were great and danced and played with the children.Everyone in the parades were really enjoying themselves,dancing and interacting with the crowds and enjoying their work.Word of warning about rides. We went to Crush's coaster in the studio park.It had a height restriction of 1.7m which our 4 year old passed. We had seen this ride on the park information on the t.v. in our room. It showed a typical family on the ride enjoying the surrounds of what supposed to have been underwater.What it didnt show was that it was a roller coaster type ride at high speed. It was petrifying for all of us and I REALLY thought that my little girl was goint to fall out.My husband was trying to hold her in but couldn't put his arm around her because of the shape of the seats.We just told her to hold on and prayed.I really think this ride is not suitable for the height it shows.I would say not really suitable for under 10year olds.It certainly isnt the pleasant family ride it shows on t.v! SO AVOID THIS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN.Great holiday,expensive and tiring but well worth the visit.We will be back!",Disneyland_Paris
109407225,4,2011-5,United States,"I   ve seen Disneyland in Anaheim, CA, Disneyworld in Florida and now Disney Paris. So far, Disneyworld in Florida is by far the best experience and value. Disneyland Paris has a lot of charm and it   s not as big as the other parks so if you don   t want to walk forever and a day, you are good plus the lines are not nearly as long. I would avoid any of the buffets, a waste of money, otherwise if Disneyland Paris is your choice, then have fun!",Disneyland_Paris
109371613,3,2011-5,United States,"Went with my two sisters who were disabled. It took me 5 hours to book this holiday and two trips to travel agents.I booked through First Choice who were amazing but Disney Paris were shocking. each time First Choice called we got different advice! We got cut off several times. Firstly they said there was no adapted rooms, then the adapted rooms had no handle bars. We were told all Disney parks had bath tubs and none with showers. We finally found an adapted room but the lady on the phone from Disney Paris could not tell us if it was available unless we booked it. They could not help us with transfers so we booked a private taxi for extra cost. Then we were told to measure the wheelchair and it could not be accepted by Air France had it had to be 110cm in height, ours was 116cm. Discrimination! All this drama for no reason. when we phoned Air France they said,  do you really think we are going to refuse you because we are going to measure your wheelchair1 .The airport were great and we got to the hotel fine. The doors were not all electronic and if they were the sensors were rubbished as we got trapped in them. The Seqiou Lodge room was dull, old fashioned decor and bathroom had no fan or window. The beds were made but not changed even if they were dirty.Only one tiny lift to go downstairs to restaurant!We could book a special transfer to park which came in 10 20 mins to pick us up and was well adapted. We hired another wheelchair from the park but it was hard to find as it was disguised in shop. They wanted 150    deposit,    9 a day to hire. At City Hall we had to present a blue badge or a doctors letter to get a disabled pass .The pass was useful as we could jump queues and had special sections for parades. It was annoying how everyone kept wanting to see it when we weren't pushing them in wheelchairs for fun of it! The Studios had special seats for wheelchairs to see the shows. The railway which takes you from one end of park to another was rubbish, only one section was allocated for one wheelchair. Even then you had to physically lift it up the little step. then they wanted you to be seated around it. One station didn't have ramp exit or lift.A lot of maintenance happening at the park this year, which was a shame.We usually go in half term, it was fairly quiet in term time. The food as everyone knows was veryyyyyyyyyyyy overpriced and not much for vegetarians.Disabled toilets were located across the park. Was difficult to drive wheelchair on some parts between park, as surface uneven. Shops weren't wide enough to have wheelchair to go around.On paper it all looked good for the disabled but in reality it was very limited.I nearly lost my temper when I was asked to show my disable pass so the worker could open the door at the exit of the park to let us out.My sisters loved the experience, please go but be aware of all the things I have mentioned.",Disneyland_Paris
109099465,2,2010-11,United States,"I had done a significant amount of preliminary research prior to our visit to ensure I understood what to expect and to be as prepared as possible. Many of our park experiences, were fun and entertaining, with some exceptions, notably the food.I fully understood, expected and accepted the especially high prices. The terrible quality and limited offerings, however created growing frustration. It seems that rather than cook food of the region (even fast food), they seem to be attempting to offer a American style fast food concept that is worse than what I see served in American school cafeterias but for prices that are extremely high, even when you are expecting them to be over inflated. it was cold when we visited and it seemed that at all levels the food service experienced problems. Any baked goods, which might look like they should be warm were in fact ice cold on the 2 times we purchased from carts with heat lamps. We selected the Plaza Gardens reluctantly one day after reviewing it's offerings at 2 pm. Our 6pm reservation provided an experience that seemed like we were literally picking over the scraps leftover from some other part of the park, with no service and a huge bill. It was the most disgusting meal I had in 2010. The only exceptional meal in our 4 day trip, was at the Agrabah Cafe, open for a just a few hours on one of our days. While perhaps not for young children, it offered the only fresh and delicious food I'd seen in a peaceful location. It was a great escape and even though astoundingly expensive, wished was an option every day of our visit.Customer Service also seems to be a foreign concept at the park. I don't ask for much, and am very sensitive to not be a self righteous American. One stand out experience occurred on our last day when our hotel concierge suggested that we could purchase any souvenirs in the park and ask for them to be held at the store until you leave the park. We asked the store clerk twice about this policy before making our purchases. When handed our bags we asked again for the items to be held. We were told that we needed to ask at the beginning of the transaction, which is precisely what we had done, with what appeared to be a clear understanding from the cast member. Frustrated, we asked for assistance at City Hall where a very nice cast member apologized and indicated that anything is possible and that if we return to the store they will be able to hold our purchases. They again insisted they could not and stated we could use the package storage service outside the park, which we reluctantly went to, only to learn it would cost 3   , which is so unacceptable given that it should have been held for free several minutes earlier as we had requested. Frustrated for feeling like some kind of stupid fools, we eventually just returned the purchases to avoid carrying them all day, repurchasing what we could before our departure. There were many other negative experiences marring our vacation.I think it is acceptable to be expensive, but never to feel you're being blatantly ripped off. I like to come to a Disney Park (and even spend a lot of my money) to forget about the outside world, not wishing I would be back in it.",Disneyland_Paris

107761057,4,2011-4,Greece,"There are hundreds of reviews so I'll write few things. We visited park two weeks ago. Everything is beautiful and clean. I recommend it for children over 8 years old so they can attend almost everything. It worth the visit but It is exhausted. It is better you spend more than one day because I believe you cannot do a lot of things in the first day. Learn about fast pass is useful and if possible do not go on weekends. You can hire a stroller for small ones and for bigger children it is useful because you will not have to carry them. I loved Buzz, Star Wars, Phantom Manor and train tour in the Disney studios. My only reserve is about food. Food is awful and expensive. If it is possible try to avoid it not only in the park but also to the neighboring Disney Village. They have to do something about it because it ruined our whole image of the park.",Disneyland_Paris
107643999,5,2011-5,Ireland,"Ok, so I went with one friend (2 females in mid twentys) we wanted to have fun and try a different type of holiday, not your usual binge drinking and out clubbing all the time!We had an absolute ball! It really is for children but if you have a little imagination, it is what you make it. We stayed from 4th may to 9 the may (5 days and 4 nights) I will review all restaurants, blue lagoon, silver spur steak house, inventions, and sequoia lodge hotel also.We booked package through abbey travel flights accom trandfers and breakkie was like 650 pp for the 4 nights and 5 days, also included park passes for 5 days.I had read many reviews leading up to the holidays so I booked all restaurants and buffallo bill show a few weeks in advance, to avoid dissapointment. This was a good idea as we planned around these bookings and it helped with the flow of the holiday.When we arrived at cdg airport, we waited about 20 mins for shuttle bus (vea) to disney hotels, it stops at all hotels and sequoia lodge was second. We got there, waited in q about 5 mins before checking in, we arrived about 2pm and room was ready, we asked for smoking room, and 2 double beds. The hotel even smells amazing  the forest smells, and as we were at restaurants in other hotels, I think they all have their own smells. Even this was something we noticed. Room was very nice, not too much detail, beds were comfy, decent shower, I advise bringing hairdryer, as theirs is not good at all it is stuck to wall. Also dont forget adaptors as their sockets are different! Plenty of storage space nice big windows to open for fresh air, but view not so good  it was of back of hotel, but we didnt mind as were only there for sleep!Get up early! like have your breakfast at 7am to avoid q, q starts around 7.45, which at this time is a bit hectic! we didnt mind as it is all part of the experience. Nice buffett  lots different cold meatts, pastries, cheeses yoghurts, coffees, juices, spreads toast etc etc.Only a small area of park open for hotel guests at 8am, but well worth going to each day. Well worth using fast pass for rides that let you.We planned and booked a lot before we left, and it was worth it! it helped us maximise our time. It is very exhausting, my back was very sore by the 3rd day and got worse, form all the standing and walking I was not used to, but I kept going as I knew I had to maximise the time I had. The wed and thurs was not half as busy as the weekend at all, so would recoommend that.Drinks in hotels all the same prices every where in disney, nice range of cocktails, most cocktails 8 euro to 11.50, pints were 6.90, no budweiser, but cocktails were delish, would recommend pina colada!If you want night time cocktails and entertainment I would recommend disney village. They even have a night club  we never went though due to exhaustion! Sports bar and western bar good for entertainment. We saw buffalo bill show, was quite good. but was 71 euro fpr premier seats, couldnt really see much of a difference to normal seats 59 euro. Decent food, filled us up but more for entertainment. The kids around us loved it.We brought a lot of money with us, including everything (dinners, lunches, lots of cocktails and loads of pressies to bring home) Id say we spent about 1400 1800 between us for 5 days. We could have done it on a much lower budget  it is doable but we wanted to splash out anyway!Once your prepared for a lot of walking and you plan your visit and book in advance, you will have a ball! We did and we would recommend to anyone. Maybe we would do it in 2 or 3 nights next time just for disney, we had planned on going to paris etc but we never bothered as so much to do in disney. Also la valle shopping oputlet is nothing, I wouldnt bother it was a waist of time! and if you smoke, you cannot get smokes after 9 or 10 anywhere! only place you can buy smokes is in train station shop which closes that time, no where in disney sold smokes, not even smoke machines in hotels or bars! That was our only disaster! Everything else was AMAZING!!!!!! MAGICAL!!",Disneyland_Paris
107586136,1,2011-5,United Kingdom,"I booked on 8 January 2011 and paid for one infant (under 2), one youth and one adult and paid Disneyland paris for first class direct train.They phoned me 4 months later on 5 May 2011 and tell me we have one tranfer at Leele as the direct train is over booked and they get limited seats from Euro star.I explained its not convinient as we have infant and change on 7.39pm is not on.

107169111,4,2011-4,United Kingdom,"Was there for our annual trip 26 29 April. Although we have been numerous times during Easter school holidays, was not expecting it to be so busy this year due to UK holidays being staggered and lots of French and Spanish children being back at school. How wrong we were!Arrived early Tuesday morning after checking in at Sequoia Lodge and did a couple of rides in Fantasy Land during Extra Magic Hours before making our way to Storybook Ride Casey Junior for their 10am opening. Casey Junior gets very busy later in the day.Headed to Big Thunder Mountain which is our favourite ride and was feeling quite jittery the closer we got. I couldn't hear it in the distance! Was gutted to see it was closed!! I asked a CM at the entrance when it would reopen and was told  it could be closed all week . Well at least I knew this ride may have to wait to next year! (When we got home, we discovered that there had been an accident on BTM the day before which put my disappointment in perspective).Anyway, the park was really busy but we enjoyed it as always. Queue times were worse than normal   the people normally queueing for BTM had to go elsewhere so this must also have had an impact.The Disney Dance Express seemed to go down well with the children as did the interactive stops during the Once Upon A Dream Parade. However, we did not see the show in front of the castle which is only on once daily at 7pm. There is a lot of work going on around the park and green screens, scaffolding and white scrim was popping up all over the place during the four days. However, this should not spoil anyone's enjoyment.I would recommend you plan as much as possible before you go, use the fastpass facility, check the queue times board regularly and don't let any little niggles get you down. Go and have a good time   you will   and if you don't get to do everything, you may just have to go again!",Disneyland_Paris
106901772,4,2011-5,India,"We went to Disneyland for the first time with our two kids  aged 7 and 9 earlier this week. We had just a day, and so were debating whether to buy a single park ticket (cheaper by about   10 when bought in advance) or a 2 park Hopper ticket. In the end, we opted for the latter  and were glad we did. We hopped between the two parks 2 or 3 times to get to rides and shows that we wanted to  and only left when the park closed at 10pm. In fact we preferred the Disney Studios as we felt there were too many rides for younger kids at the Disneyland Park, or the queues for the other rides were too long on that day.Big Thunder mountain was still closed, and they also shut Crush's Coaster in the evening of the day we were there. Nevertheless, our kids still had a lot of fun.",Disneyland_Paris
106896552,2,2011-4,United Kingdom,"If you've never been to a Disney Park and are thinking about your first visit then don't read on. However   if you've previously been to the parks in America and you've now been to the park in Paris, I imagine you may nod your head reading this.This place shouldn't really be called 'Disneyland Paris'. If they were being accurate when naming this it should be called 'Theme Park based on the one in Orlando   but run by the French'.Having been to the parks in Orlando on a couple of occasions it has to be said this park is a very poor relation   the black sheep of the family.My wife, 6 year old son and I stayed for 3 nights 4 days over the recent Bank Holiday weekend and to be honest I was disappointed. Where to Start?Staying at a Disney Hotel 'entitles' you to additional 'Magic' hours in the parks   although it is only for the Magic Kingdom and not the Studios. The extra hours are a waste of time. On our first day there we got to the park at just after 0900   1 hour into the extra hours   and nothing was open or operating!! There was nowhere open to get a coffee, no shops open to part with your cash and the only areas you could get to were Main Street and Fantasyland   all the other areas were roped off with a glum looking 'Cast Member' stood there stopping anyone from exploring. Even though you could get into Fantasyland (the other side of the castle) no rides operated until shortly before 1000   WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!! Certainly not what happens in Orlando.The quality of the rides was generally poor. Some of the rides that you sit on a train for and go on a journey (as were all rides) were over in less than 60 second (the Carousel in Fantasyland only goes around twice before it stops and you have to get off!!) There was little attention to detail in some of the rides. The scenery on all of the indoor rides seemed to stop at eye level   when you looked up all you could see were ceiling panels   which weren   t always there. Also despite the parks opening to everyone at 1000 a lot of the shows in the parks (Cinemagique etc) don't have their first showing until 1200. Something we couldn't understand.The attitude of the 'cast members' wasn't particularly enthusiastic either. On the first evening we tried to get a table at the restaurant in Frontierland at a few minutes past 2000 (the park closes at 2100)   we tried this one because every other eatery in the park was already closed   despite the restaurant only being at best a third full we were told in no uncertain terms that they were not serving anyone else tonight. Aslo the staff are in no hurry to serve you either. We stopped for some ice cream at the ice cream parlour on Main Street. When we began queuing, there was 1 person in front of us. 15minutes later when they had served that 1 person with 3 scoops of ice cream   there was a queue out the door   something that was to be a regular occurrence.There is no two ways about it   the parks are incredibly expensive for food and souvenirs. When in the Magic Kingdom we stopped at Casey   s at the top of Main Street for a quick bite. I had a cheesey hot dog with soft drink (no souvenir cup) and it cost   8.00   it certainly was not worth it. Among some of the souvenirs we looked at we wanted some photo frames for some of the pictures we had. A plain wooden frame   with tiny Mickey Mouse ears embossed in each corner for a 6  x 4  photo was 15 Euros!!! I always expect theme parks to be a bit more expensive   but the cost of things here is ridiculously high   at least Dick Turpin wore a mask!!!Although you wouldn't call the place unclean, it is certainly nowhere near as clean as it's counterpart in Orlando. It's not uncommon to find black sticky marks over the pavements where drinks have been spilt days previously and nothing been done.Also the park tolerates 'Street Merchants' hassling customers just outside the park entrance. Several times men offering Caricatures for a price tried to make a move towards our son to get him to go over. Plus in the evening there were vendors who laid out a small towel and were selling very cheap and tacky souvenirs   none of it Disney related. Not sure this would have been tolerated in Orlando!!That said, if (like I do) you have a wife and child that are mad for Disney then it is worth a quick visit (provided you have deep pockets!!) to let them get a 'fix' of the Disney Magic!!",Disneyland_Paris
106792930,1,2011-4,United Kingdom,"What a waste of money and dissappointing visit.Disneyland Paris   cold and rainy and staffed by miffed looking Parisians. Wheres the magic?!Thunder Mountain was closed, the disney castle (and many other attractions) shrouded in scaffolding and tarps. Dreadful customer service. Long queues regularly being queue jumped by French, German and Russians who  don't do queues . Only a few attractions available on the Fastpass system.Dirty streets and everyone smoking!Just don't do it.Save up and go to Disney in Florida or LA...... so much better in every way.",Disneyland_Paris
106740512,3,2011-5,United Kingdom,"This was a return trip for me, having originally visited the park back in 1992 as a child. The first thing I would say is that not much has changed in the Disneyland park. There has been the addition of the Walt Disney Studio's, which has improved the overall experience of the attraction.The most dissapointing elements of the park was that the castle in the middle was surrounded by scaffolding and a lot of the area around the castle was bodered off with sign's stating that they were renevating for our future enjoyment. Unfortunately like most people since it has been nearly twenty years since my first and second visit, I am unlikely to benefit from any changes they are making. I also wondered why these imporvements were not carried out during the winter months ?The Thunder Mountain ride was also closed during our visit due to an accident the previous week, and the Rock and Roller coaster was also closed for some time during our visit.The Walt Disney studio's are more up to date and I felt more enjoyable. The back stage tour will leave you a little dissapointed if you have been to Universal etc as there is not much too it, but I would reccomend Toy Story land for the younger generation, and the rock and rollercoaster, the twighlight zone and the armageddon experience for the older people in the party.I enjoyed my time there, but feel the park has become a bit dated, and I think this shows with some of the attractions out of order or being renovated. Definately use the fast pass system to your benefit or you will be stood around for hours, and be prepared to be all 'Disneyed' out by the end of your visit !!",Disneyland_Paris
106220841,4,2011-4,Sweden,"I've reviewed the Studios (our favourite bit), Sequoia Lodge and various restaurants in other reviews so this mainly focuses on our 1.5 days on the Park side of DLP. Getting there   after reading various comments on the VEA shuttle, TGV and other options we decided to book a private shuttle at a cost of 60 euros. We tried one of the ones recommended on here but they were fully booked and pointed us towards Tioshuttle who provided a good quality minivan (DVD player included if you need entertainment for kids). Getting direct from CDG T1 to Sequoia Lodge in 30 40 minutes was a good way to arrive as it meant we maximised our time on day one. The day we left we used the RER to get to Gare du Nord for the Eurostar. The station was about a 10 15 minute walk with bags and a pushchair and the journey itself was fairly easy. 6.70 euros per adult at the time of writing.The Park Day one   Having gone for about 20 years without visting a theme park the first day was completely overwhelming. With hindsight we should have focussed less on Fantasyland as we didn't get in to the Park until midday and it was by far the most crowded part of the park. Someone else has recommended using side paths and the arcades behind Main Street to get away from the crowds and I'd second this. There were queues for everything with most rides having a waiting time of at least 30 minutes. We were visiting with our son who is nearly three years old. He was getting over a cold and coupled with an early start he wasn't in the best mood which added to the initial stress. However, things did gradually pick up. We went on a couple of rides and then went for an early dinner at Cafe Mickey. Lots of characters which made up for the limited access to them in the Park. Day two   on the whole we found staff to be very helpful and friendly. The only exception was first thing on day two. We went in during the Magic Hours and whilst our son doesn't seem to be that keen on rides yet he did ask to go on the Main Street bus. According to the sign it runs all day so we weren't worried when the bus filled up just as we got to the stop. The conductor could clearly see that we were going to wait for it get back (15 20 minutes) and made no attempt to let us know that it would be the last run. Cue one tantrum when it drove back past us, dropped off the passengers and drove in to the back lot. This wasn't a short break as we double checked with the driver who said that it wasn't coming out again soon. At that point we headed off to the Studios for the rest of the day where we had a great time (see separate review). We went back to the Park last thing and had an enjoyable ride on the train that runs around the perimeter. We were lulled into thinking that the queue at Frontierland was relatively short but most trains arrived already full (45 minutes). Still worth the wait as our son loves the steam train on Boogie Beebies. The steamboat was also a big hit.Day three   we went back to the park for our final day and this time felt a bit more clued up about how things worked. We used the Fastpass system for the Buzz Lightyear ride and then went off to queue for the It's a Small World boatride. It's quite an assault on the senses but very enjoyable (for the adults anyway   I think our son enjoyed it). Then back to Buzz Lightyear which was also great. We watched a bit of the Peter Pan show in Adventureland before having lunch at Hakuna Matata. This was reasonable for fast food although you'd think that I was the first person who'd ever asked for vegetable rice instead of chips judging by the confusion it caused (it is on the menu   I wasn't being difficult). They also forgot to give us the fruit salad which was included as part of the meal deal. The entertainment in this area seemed to be good. There was a chance to meet some Lion King characters and to play some African drums. We then spent some time exploring Adventureland with it's pirate ship, playground, rope bridge and caves   a big hit with our son. We then went back to the Alice in Wonderland themed maze in Fantasyland. This was fun and had one of the shortest queues that we came across (15 minutes). The Queen of Hearts was a little scary but we turned it in to a game of hide and seek when she popped up from behind a hedge. We then went back to Frontierland for some time in the playground and another trip on the steamboat (no queue). We were fairly shattered by this point and as we wanted to see the Main Street parade we headed there and sat on the kerb for an hour. This guaranteed us a very good position and luckily the rain which had been threatening all day held off for a bit longer. The parade was excellent with many of new and old characters having a place on one of the floats. Pluto and Goofy were particularly entertaining. There was one float based on a movie that I didn't know and our son did find this one quite scary. We then went to the Disneyland Hotel Inventions buffet for another character meal (fantastic   see separate review).All in all we had a really good time once we'd had the first day to orientate ourselves and learn how things worked. The Fastpass system is excellent but isn't available for that many rides. With hindsight we should have picked up a second one for the Peter Pan themed ride as soon as we'd used our first pass. By mid afternoon the earliest Fastpass time available for this ride was 8.30 p.m. If you asked me if we'd go again the the answer would be yes but not for a few years. I'd want our son to be old enough to have the confidence to go on more of the rides. He'd also be big enough to have access to a few more of them e.g. we didn't realise that Crush's Coaster had a 1.07 metres height restriction. Couple of random things   queues for some toilets were huge whilst others that were slightly hidden away and had no queues at all (Main Street arcades). Take an empty bottle to refill from the water fountains. We took a lock for our stroller but never used it. There were areas to leave strollers in the vicinity of each ride (you couldn't queue with a troller for most things which was a pain if your child was sleepy).",Disneyland_Paris
106098354,4,2011-4,United Kingdom,We did not get a lot of time here due to other factors. So we really needed to make the most of very minute. I had paid for a disabled child pass so we could jump queues. But we had not been informed we also required evidence (i.e) a Doctors letter or a valid blue badge which you had to that to the City Hall ( near entrance ) to obtain a separate Disney green pass this information should of been passed on to us.,Disneyland_Paris
106089123,1,2011-3,United Kingdom,"We visited in March 2011 and it was our fifth time. There won't be anymore. The Pirates of the Caribbean ride was closed due to refurbishment. This was a massive dissapointment as it is arguably the best attraction they have. The was a hoarding outside the front reading 'closed for refurbishment and you future entertainment'. Do these people think we can just pop back over when they've finished? Another popular ride, Big Thunder Mountain, was also out of action for two days due to technical difficulties. This was the nail in the coffin for me. As a result of these closures, there was around four or five hundred extra people in circulation . This made the place a lot busier and queueing a nightmare for everything except 'It's a small World' because nobody wants to go in there anyway! The French were the usual arrogant and impolite people we have expected them to be. The prices in and around the parks have become astronomical. Just under Seven Euro's for a pint of warm beer. The food was also horrendously expensive and largely awful. For what it cost us as a family of Four, we could have gone to Spain for a week and probably had a much better, and less stressful time. We will never, ever go back to Disneyland Paris. They need to stop ripping people off!",Disneyland_Paris
105996834,5,2011-4,United States,"We spent a day at Disney Park in Paris with our 13 and 10 year old kids. We have been to the parks in the states and enjoyed this one just as much as those parks. They had most if not all of the rides that are at Disney World in Florida. The park also feels new and is very clean. We took advantage of fast pass on several rides by getting our pass in that section of the park and then riding other rides near the fast past ride until our time window. I would recommend taking the kids here for a day or two. We did not get to check out the studio park or the shopping eating area outside the park. They looked like fun. We only had a day, but could have used 2 more!",Disneyland_Paris
105990427,3,2011-4,United Kingdom,"Busiest time for Disney must be Easter time. Queues are looong for any ride even though we went in a weekday. I thought the whole of Europe was there that day. Fastpass is a must for popular rides. Parking is not cheap, so go instead to Disney Village multistorey parking which is much cheaper and closer to the entrances to the parks. Food and shopping items are really a rip off.",Disneyland_Paris
105940591,4,2011-4,United States,"Had a great time with the kids during easter break, as usual Disney is great at making you feel the magic. The park has all the right attractions, nevertheless something feels dated and not fresh as it does in Orlando, eventhough it is much older. I must admit I was annoyed by the huge quantity of people, but it was something to expect during easter, the minor observation I have for management is that there seemed to be staff missing, I assume it has to do with more stringent labor laws than in the US. Anyhow Disney is unique and it is a wonderful place, the shows and parades were great. Unfortunately the castle was covered with scaffolding.",Disneyland_Paris
105936088,3,2011-4,United States,"First let me say I have been to both Disney's in the U.S and was aware that Eurodisney was not going to be the same. Booked a package on the Disney website for a week at the Newport Resort, suppossedly one of the better facilities. Looks good from outside but needs some work. I live in Europe and am familar with their standards. Room was fine but small, which was not a problem as we were out and about. However the rooms need some work, there were numerouss chips and dings in the furniture and the bath room has 'debris' from the previous tenants, plus our door had annoying habit of sticking all the time, some of the wall board was loose, etc. . Overall staff was friendly and for the most part helpful. Our pacakge included the continental breakfast and here is a tip, if you want to avoid the mayhem and the obnoxious, rude people, schedule your seating for as close to the last seating as possible, say 8:15   8:30. You'll avoid lines, have plenty of room, food will probably be fresher and not picked over and be able to move around without tripping over an unsupervised and highly excited youngster. I know is is Disney..Also the jacuzzi should be an adults only feature. Little kids should not be encouraged to use it as a wading pool and diving platform. There was a wading pool but it did not get used at all.Oh and food is way over priced and sucked. Our two meals were cold and almost tasteless despite the 150 Euro price and slllloooowwww service. If you can visit the Mall at La'Varne (within a KM or so) you have a choice of reasonably priced restaurents. We spent a 1 3 less and got vastly better fare.....vastly.Eurodisney is definitely not big. Don't waste a lot of time expecting to get on the popular rides. Space Mountain was broke most of the time and other popular rides like Indiana Jones, Thunder Mountain Railroad, Pirates of the Carribean had lines of one hour or more. Oh and this was the first week it was open after the winter break so you'd think things were workiing ok. To avoid this issue go early and go fast to your preferred ride. And no, the Disney Fast Pass system is a joke. Also many of the rides have been cut severely as far as the versions in the U.S. there are key parts missing. So be prepared.One redeeming factor was the side trip to Paris. Great way to spend a day and really enjoy the Paris area. Take advantage of their one day train pass to Paris. Costs about 18Euro per person but gives you free access to the train, metro and busses. So we traveled with abandon in the city on the Siene.Overall is was a learning experience, but Eurodisney has such great possibilites and it just looks like the investment was not made to really produce the quality that Disney is known for. If we do again we'll visit and stay in Paris and maybe take a side trip to Disney or maybe not......it is not worth a week or more than a day or two or maybe a few hours.....and don't upgrade your money is better spent on other things......but be prepared.",Disneyland_Paris
105327591,4,2011-4,United States,"First two days in France were in Disney at the Radisson which was located at Allee De La Mare Houleuse, Magny le Hongre, Seine et Marne,France. Which is actually a very nice suburb of Paris. At the train station they have a free shuttle (big bus) to the hotel for free. We also had the daily buffet which was very good.The Radisson actually let us check in early there at( gasp) 9 am into our room. Never seen this anywhere and I have traveled quite a bit. Well we had purchased two day all park tickets so it was put the luggage up,chug half a energy drink and on to Disney. The sight you actually see is the awesomely huge Disneyland Hotel which actually is part on the entrance. Hey they like pink over here and it really looks striking as well as the typical beautiful manicured garden and fountain you find at the entrance. Very Disney yet very French at the same time. I really liked it.The parks are broken up into three sections Disneyland Paris, Walt Disney Studios, and Disney Village (which is their version of Downtown Disney).There was a lot of good and well not Disney enough for me.A lot of the park was in ill repair hand rails worn and even the Mark Twain with a lot of chipped paint. Maybe its from coming out of winter. Dont get me wrong I liked the park but the up keep was not as I have seen or experience here in the states.Sleeping Beauty's castle was perfect though. This was my favorite Disney movie and the castle was just like looking at the opening shot of the movie. It was perfect. As well as dont miss the Dragons Lair that is on the bottom left side (facing from Main Street). Very big and very cool its a walkthrough. I think the parks were more geared toward the little ones which is fine. Not a lot of rides for the older folks. Not as many rides as in the parks here in the states. But there were some good ones. Crushes Coaster was very cool and exciting. The Pirates of the Caribbean here was longer and had a lot of different things which I thought was cool. No Captain Jack but still good. Haunted Mansion was Phantom Manor was also different a haunted bride theme was present through the entire ride plus all the old standards. Tower of Terror was a bit longer as well. The back lot tour was cool because I am a big fan of the movie  Reign of Fire  and they had the London set from that with dragon fire coming out of the hole. Plus they had a cool Armageddon ride experience. The Indiana Jones ride was a pretty good coaster but not much Indy at all. But it was a good coaster. The folks here really like the Old West theme. That seemed to be the hat of choice for the Europeans in general. Thats neat but Im from Phoenix, Arizona so not much appeal to me. Glad my brother and sisters over the pond like it though. Space Mountain Mission Two was very intense. Very different ride with special effects using lasar at the end which was very cool and different from what we have here in the US.Yes and they have Big Thunder Mountain, Small World (cute everytime), Captain Hooks ship and Skull Rock was very cool. All in all you can hit these parks in two day's no problem.The big let down here was no fireworks. Whats up with that. Must have been the time of year and cost I guess that was a letdown though. Also the parade titled  Once Upon A Dream . It was very good and it was cool to hear the songs we love in both english and french (he gotta respect the home turf). The other thing I noticed was I didnt see any extra entertainment or bands along Main Street or anywhere at all. I know of Europe's love for music (he it started there) so I wonder what was up with that. I chalked it up to cost again.There were quite a lot of Character sightings all over the park which was great.Being the old Disney fanatic I am Im glad I went to the parks.It was early April and chilly but that was ok.Couple hintsOf course its pricy to eat at Disney and there were a lot of the sit down restaurants which were not even open.My suggestion is if you are hungry go to the Sports bar in Disney Village you can get a huge ham and cheese sandwich and fries for around 7 euro. Gotta love the french baguette .Also they do have fast passes here and because of the lack of big thrill rides even on a slow day you could end up waiting. So make good use of fast passes.Any questions?Ask away?All in all we loved beautiful Disneyland Paris.Little housekeeping here and there would bring it up to Disney standards but..Disneyland Paris est tr  s belle et magnifique.",Disneyland_Paris
105304114,1,2011-4,Denmark,"One time and never again.  The staff was unkind, the queues were hours long the food was bad and very expensive, the toilets were very dirty, the signs were not clear ... what made me spend so much money to get in there?",Disneyland_Paris
105226039,4,2011-3,United States,"Went on our first family trip to Disneyland Paris. Stayed at the Newport Bay Hotel. First thing, was the pick up from the airport by the Disneyland Bus, finding this was a bit of a challenge as the airport is huge and it wasn't marked very clearly. Followed the croweds and found it eventually, but be prepared for a wait. With young children this was a bit of a nightmare and some people don't like to queue. When we were picked up it wasn't a long journey to Disneyland, around 40 mins. Checked in and headed off straight away. Shuttle bus is great, but can get busy so be prepared to stand, but it is only a short journey. EVERYTHING in Disneyland is expensive, so be prepared to pay above the odds. The only thing we found to be slightly better value then home were some of the toys, i.e big Buzz Lightyear and Woody were around 30 euro each when they are nearly 50 at home. Eat in Cafe Mickey and Rainforest Cafe. Rainforest Cafe was great for kids to watch animals come alive etc, and food was ok, Cafe Mickey was great fun and bring camera for pics with characters, again food was ok nothing special. In both restaurants it cost around 120 for two adults and two children to eat, no wine, so speaks for itself. Confortable shoes are a must as you walk, walk, walk. We brought drink bottles for the kids and filled them each morning at the buffet with juice as things like drinks and snacks are outragious. Disneyland itself was great fun, Once Upon a time Parade is worth seeing and I would suggest getting the train that goes around the park. It's a lovely break from the walking and the kids and adults enjoyed seeing everything in the park. We were lucky with the queues we never fastpassed and the longest q was for Dumbo, which was about 20 mins. Buzz Lightyear Laser acadamy was brilliant and I would really recommend the Star Wars Tour, we didn't know what to expect and there was no q, we went on again, as it was brill and the kids loved it. There is a min height requirement of 1m 2in. Don't get carried away with shopping, even though there are tons of shops all decorated differently, all the products they sell are the exact same. Same t shirts, same jumpers, same toys, some do offers of the day at till points and you might pick up some things extra that you can use for gits. Overall it is a great experience, very tiring but kids loved it and to be honest so did we! Shop and eat carefully and your wallet might enjoy it too.",Disneyland_Paris
104763712,3,2011-4,United Kingdom,"Here's an abridged copy of the complaint email I've sent to DLP...I visited with my teenage daughter and her friend. We last visited 10 years ago when my children were much younger, and I have to say that the park has seriously declined in that time.  We have only ever visited during school holidays, so knew that it was going to be very crowded, and we arrived before the official opening time, expecting long queues around the busiest parts of the day.  We didn't mind the queues and thoroughly enjoyed the rides and attractions once we were able to reach them, but, a major difference from our previous visits was that there were far fewer Disney  cast members  around to answer any queries or give directions. Furthermore, while some of them were polite and helpful, a number were more like Grumpy from the Seven Dwarfs   no smiles and unwilling or unable to offer much help. In comparison, when we have visited in the past, there were plenty of Disney staff in evidence throughout the queues (not just at the embarkation point), who would chat and answer questions   and crucially, ask people to stop smoking. This time I was appalled at the number of people smoking cigarettes around the park with no one stopping them.  For an attraction aimed at young children, with rules that ask people not to smoke outside designated areas, this is unforgivable.  Although we were able to avoid smokers walking around the park, we of course had no option to stand near them if they were smoking in the (long) queues. Had I seen any cast members in evidence, I would have pointed this out and asked the staff member to tell the smokers to stop   but the apparent reduction in staffing meant it was not possible for me to complain to anyone in authority.  We queued for 50 minutes to ride Pirates of the Caribbean, only for the ride to break down before we had chance to embark. While these sort of things do happen, it left me wondering if your evident reduction in staffing levels is also extending to less maintenance for the rides. And the queueing area for Big Thunder Mountain was dirty, with overflowing rubbish bins   I have attached a photograph I took as we queued for an hour for this ride. Not the sort of holiday picture I really want to bring home, and it reflects on your organisation very badly. It appears that far from the Disney  Magic , what has developed is an attitude of far less attention to detail, a lack of adequate staffing and poor training management of cast members.  Your marketing makes much of the Disney  Magic , but if this isn't in evidence, then families like ours will choose to go elsewhere in future   there are plenty of other theme parks to choose from these days. I shall share these experiences with people I know, including on internet forums where people discuss their holiday plans   and I await your response with interest.",Disneyland_Paris
104667805,5,2011-4,United Kingdom,"went for 5 days and 4 nights and honestly would go back tomorrow if money allowed me to!!!. we stayed at the santa fe which was basic but clean and comfortable the breakfast was basic too and busy after 7.30 but we never struggled to get a table at any time.  the parks were amazing make the most of the 2 hours its open to hotel guests before the general public as dumbo, peter pan ride and buzz ride get busy later on, dumbo had a queue of 50 minutes on sunday which was the busiest day we were there Mid week is much quieter we never queued for more than 25 minutes on any rides. Food was expensive 35 euros for three burgers chips and drinks, we had the half board vouchers which were useful for budgeting the holiday we also used them as part payment towards buffalo bills show and at cafe mickey which both are worth checking out. my daughter turned 6 while we were away and loved all the kids rides and the parades and shows we also had evening meal with the princesses and princes which she also loved and was well worth the money for that special treat. in general the parks were very clean and tidy, the staff were all very friendly and helpful. we were worried about going after reading some of the reviews but it had all the magic that you would from disney and more, the characters were everywhere especially before 12 in both parks and they were great with all the kids, so go and have the time of your lives x",Disneyland_Paris
104139512,4,2011-4,United Kingdom,"We went to Disneyland Paris about 10 years ago and have been to Disneyworld in Orlando since. So when I read some poor reviews about Disneyland I was worried that we would be disappointed. We visited in the April easter holidays 2011. Lets clear a few things up, this park is smaller than the one in Orlando, but that makes it far easier to get around. The two theme parks, Village and Hotels are all within a five minutes walk of each other and the train station is right in the middle. This park is far prettier than the one in Orlando and the rides are better designed being newer than those in the US. The landscaping is beautiful and the parks are well manicured and kept very clean. The floor needs sorting in out between the bus stops and park gates. They are building a new Disny store here and I imagine that the construction traffic has damaged the floors. I suspect that these will be replaced before the new store opens. I was impressed with Disney Studios, Rock & Rollercoaster, Tower of Terror and Crush's Coaster are all worth several rides. Crush's coaster broke down a couple of times and the queues are long, so choose your time well. lets talk about queues. Dont go on Saturday. Mid week is OK. If you go a couple of hours before the Disneyland park closes the smaller rides tend to have little queues. Watch out for our european friends as they dont seem to understand the concept of waiting your turn and will push in without any apology. Finally prices, We had a huge breakfast at the hotel a drink and snack mid afternoon and then a full meal at night. Disneyland is not cheap, although I would say the prices were similar to the hotels and also food in Paris. You will pay about 50 euros for burger, fries and drink for a family of 4. A meal at night with beer will set you back from 80   120 euros, so you have been warned. We found a self serve cafe oppositie rock and roller coaster in Disney Studios that had a great choice, with some healthy options and the price seemed more reasonable e.g. a large baguette for 6 euros. if you expect to queue a bit and pay high prices for junk food then you wont be disappointed. One final note   this isnt the US so dont expect everyone to be cheery and friendly. To be fair some did try their best, but the overall experience is not as upbeat as it is in the staes. enjoy, its still special.",Disneyland_Paris
104104867,5,2011-4,United Kingdom,"The park was amazing but a little daunting on first day. Organised our time into day 1 disney land day 2 Universal and day 3 whatever we liked. Worked really well. Would recommend Buzz ride, Stunt show, driving cars and peter pan. Especially for younger children Mine were 6 and 4. Downside was some rides were not described in guide and we took ours on amagedon which was not so good. The shows in Universal were amazing especially cinemagic which we all enjoyed. Be warned also how expensive everything is. Burger, chips and drink 10 euro. Take your own drink and food and there are loads of drink fountains. Also fast pass worth using for big rides saved a lot of hassle of queuing. Also if staying in hotel the extra 2 hours was worth while we got in at 9 and there were a few rides open luckily the ones we wanted. Be aware that people queue to get into areas but you go and see the man with the rope and show hotel pass card. The parade is very good we got to main street at 420 and people were starting to get positions. after 445 you would be at the back.",Disneyland_Paris
103771618,5,2011-4,United Kingdom,"Just back from our second visit to Disneyland Paris and loved every minute of it! The sunny weather was a bonus. The new Mickey show at 7.00pm is worth hanging around for, but don't stand on the right side or you'll be facing into the sun as we found out. Also, the stewards stopped us from joining the queue to see Rapunzel and we nearly missed out. If this is on your must do list queue early and don't leave it until your last day. She's beautiful and lovely to the children. Flynn is there too.If you have prepaid vouchers for the princess lunch check the small print to see if it includes wine. They changed the menu as of 6th April and it now includes only a soft drink. However, if you've already paid for this in UK, chances are yours will include wine..... for a short time anyway. We stayed at Santa Fe again as it's clean and much cheaper than the others. Breakfast is a bit of a bun fight and tables are scarce. So, we chose to go for breakfast at ten which meant the place was much more civilised and instead stayed out late. Our six year old daughter coped with this so it may be worth considering. The walk to the park is lovely about 15 minutes from the hotel.Our daughter loved Cafe Mickey, but choose the steak with a baked potato. Yummy! Remember to reserve a table. We liked an upstairs window seat as it overlooked the lake and was a bit quieter than downstairs.All in all it's a multi sensory holiday and you'll come back buzzing in more ways than one. But here's to 2012 and the 20th anniversary celebrations!",Disneyland_Paris
103613297,5,2010-6,United Kingdom,"Yes, the food prices are just astoundingly expensive and there's sometimes a 'grumpy' default to some of the staff but it's still a truly truly magical place. It's much smaller than the US Disney Parks, so very easy to get around. We were a party of five: a 2 year old and a 4 year old who were mesmerised! So too was the 30 something and the 60 something grandparents! We went in June, so not peak season. There were some queues, but nothing that was unmanageable, even with such young kids. Do beware that most people there are not polite Brits, and they don't do queues! There's a lot of queue jumping. I think it's worth trying to speak a little French if you can, to those pushy people. I piped up with a few 'Excusez moi' type phrases which did the trick. The cast members appreciate if you try a little French too, they seem to like the fact that you're trying even if you're speaking rubbish!Meeting Characters: Captain Jack s well worth queueing up to meet, he is hilarious, and really makes the kids feel special. Generally, the queueing up for characters is a bit of a bore, I would recommend going to the Hollywood Studios instead where it's much easier to meet characters, they tend to be wandering around a lot more too, rather than just at the character meeting points so it can be a great surprise. We happened upon Lilo, Stitch, Cruella de Ville and Chip and Dale just wandering around! Anyway, pack to Disneyland Park   DO NOT MISS the dragon under the castle, it's very dark in there, but really worth going to see him! Also, really worth seeing the parade   we found a good spot right in front of the town hall in the main square, the floats seemed to slow down a bit there, so there was plenty of interaction from the parade cast.Food tips:As mentioned by many others on here, the food is eye wateringly expensive at Disneyland Paris. We got around the outrageous food prices by taking in our own picnics for lunch. There's a shop inside the train station (right next to Downtown Disney) where they sell reasonably priced baguettes and sodas. They do search your bags upon entry, but we never had any problems with bringing in food. For hot food, the McDonald's in Downtown Disney is the most normal priced place. It's quite nice too, as you can sit outside.Rides:We rode everything that we wanted to, except the Autopia cars ride in Tomorrowland which permanently had a huge queue. My boys loved the Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast, we must've ridden that 10 times, luckily you can fast pass it. You have got to do the classics: Pirates, Haunted Mansion, Small World, Dumbo, Big Thunder Mountain. But my kids also loved just running around at the play area in Frontierland and the fort at the entrance to Frontierland. The train doesn't go all the way round the park like it does in the US, so if it's a big queue, it is skippable, as you don't get to see much from the train.Getting about:We took it easy really, although making sure we got up and out early as it's a truism that you get the most done in the first 3 hours of your Disney day at the parks. We didn't have a rigid plan after the first four or five things that we wanted to do. It was well worth being at Adventureland for rope drop, to go to Pirates first, this was a priority for us of course with our young pirate!One sneaky tip: Use the arcades to the right and left of main street to get to your destinations much quicker, right hand side arcade (facing the castle) for Tomorrowland and Fantasyland and left hand arcade for Frontierland and Adventureland. You can move up these arcades really quickly, not have to go slow behind everyone else on Main Street.I've been to the Disney Parks in LA and Florida, and although Paris would be my third favourite after those two, (they're really hard to beat) it is still a wonderful, wonderful place. It really does take you back to being an uncynical, awe inspired kid again. We all had an amazing MAGICAL four days to be cherished forever.",Disneyland_Paris
103517877,5,2011-3,Ireland,"Disneyland Paris is absolutely fantastic, we are just back from our 2nd visit and are already talking about going again next year, the rides are great, queues manageable especially mid week and off season, highly reccommended.",Disneyland_Paris
103504504,1,2011-2,United Kingdom,"We went there this year and this was our fourth visit and probably our last, The staff are rude and unhelpfull, try the chap at Starbucks and youll se what i mean.The flooring between the parks and parts in general are showing wear and tear, a good tip would be dont go during French holidays you will regret it , no atmosphere serious people.Off course there are a few exceptions but on the whole it seems that all the good staff have moved on and replaced by zombies.",Disneyland_Paris
103024304,5,2011-3,United Kingdom,"We had 2 days to do both parks. We arrived early to make the most of our days and were very happy to find we could enter before the advertised opening times. We didn't have to queue at all. The rides didn't open till the advertised time but it allowed us to get in the queues and we managed to get on popular rides quickly. Its fair to say though that even at peak times we didn't have to queue for long, only maybe 15 to 20 mins if that! The park was magical! Music playing as you make your way around the park and all from the popular disney films that you will recognise. Everywhere was clean and tidy. I think its best to plan ahead and make your way to the rides that are a must and get them done and out of the way early on. You can always go again if you find more time.Be ready for the parades about half an hour before they start. I was surprised to see how many people were already waiting when we arrived at main street USA half an hour before. Use the programme to find out where the disney characters will be. We managde to stumble upon Mickey, Minnie and Goofy near a fast food outlet and it wasn't very busy so im assuming not many knew about it.Food is very expensive. If you want to eat in the resturants every night like we did (disney village) then I would strongly recommend you book way in advance! It was difficult to get a seat once the parks had closed and the waiting times were often an hour or more! When we return I will book 2 weeks before to ensure a seat and so we can get back to our hotels to rest earlier. Its a very tiring day after all!",Disneyland_Paris
102899700,4,2011-3,United Kingdom,"Just back from a hectic few days at DLP. We had read such negative reports here that we had very low expectations but please don't believe everything you read   we all had a fantastic time.TransportFlew Air France straight into Terminal 2 of CDG so we caught the TGV train. Landed at 12:15 and were walking through Disney Village at 1:30pm, great. The TGV cost us   95 return for 2 adults, 2 children and took 10 mins. It is incredibly efficient and very easy to book tickets on line but would not recommend using this if you have young children, buggies, loads of luggage. You also have to find your way around the platforms so need to have your wits about you.Hotel   Sequoia LodgeWe booked a Montana room   not really sure what difference there is! Check in was welcoming and polite. Rooms are available at 3pm but rather than use the luggage drop off, we asked nicely and got a room at 2:15. The room was not re furbished and looks exactly like the photo on the web site. Yes it's old fashioned but it was spotlessly clean and had everything we needed. The best bit was that we were 1min walk to breakfast and reception   it would be awful to trek through the hotel for 10mins.Breakfast was great   loads of it and good quality. We took freezer bags to store our cheese and ham sandwiches for lunch and were quite discreet   some people brought Tupperware boxes and were openly cramming food into them!Tip   wish we had taken sports drinks bottles for the boys to fill up with apple juice for the day.Went to the pool once for a break but had to leave after 30mins as the pool was closing as there was going to be a thunderstorm???? Apparently this is Disney policy?FoodHOT TIP   book restaurants before you go.1st night   I had booked Cafe Mickey and thank goodness. We were tired and hungry by then so were sooo pleased that we could walk in past the queues. We had the Half Board Plus option but even then food and choice was not great. We ate evrything we were given (v hungry now!) but the food is not the main event here. All of the characters came to the tables and really played with the boys. At first they were too  grown up  for it, but were loving it by the end of the meal. The faces of all the children there were lovely   really magical.This was lovely at the start of the trip but would have been too much for us after being in the parks all day! I spoke to one lady in our hotel who was desperate to eat there but was told they were fully booked for the next 3 days.2nd Night   I had booked Silver Spur in Frontierland. It was very quiet there which suited us that night   we had spent 12 hrs in the park and wanted to chill. Food was quite nice here but again limited to pizza, fish or burger for the children. The waiters were very friendly and we enjoyed it there.3rd Night   Hunters Grill buffet. We don't really like buffets   too many children sneezing on the salad but we booked this for the change and because we wanted an easy final night. The food was very good   loads of choice, very good local desserts, cheese and breads and the children were glad to have just a bowl of soup and bread to start. We sort of wished we'd had a buffet on the previous nights but they were all very different experiences and suited what we were doing at the time.Generally food and drink is very expensive and very poor quality   not unlike Alton Towers or Legoland. We took snacks with us and made lunch from the breakfast but we still had to spend so much on coffees and drinks through the day. Water or fizzy drinks were 3E each so that's 12E every time. 2 coffees at Starbucks 9E.The ParksWe loved them! It was definitely busier on Sun afternoon than the rest of the days but we were able to do a few rides in the Studios and watch the amazing motor stunt show.On Mon, we had 7am brekkie, were in the park for 8:30am and had walked straight on to loads of rides in Discoveryland by 9:15am. The queues tended to be about 15mins for most things and I think we went on most of the rides that we wanted to go on in each of the lands. We got back to the hotel at 9pm and had really overdone it   feet throbbing, we all soaked in the bath and fell into bed!!!The next day we had a later breakfast and finished off the Studios and were happy with lots of shows to sit down in!PeopleThe rude, smoking, ignorant people that have been written about before must have stayed away when we were there. Everyone at the resort was lovely   especially if you tried your school French and a smile. While queueing, we found families just enjoying themselves regardless of where they came from. My 7 yr old played on his DS in the queues and he usually ended up  chatting  with another child despite the language differences.Overall we had a magical time that we will always remember. My tips would be to take snacks, drinks bottles and comfy shoes. Book restaurants in advance. Plan in advance so you know which rides are where. Take loads of money or don't go near the shops. Just enjoy it for what it is   a magical place for the family",Disneyland_Paris
102814980,4,2011-4,United Kingdom,"We went to disneyland paris 31 march to 3 april. Two adults, 4 year old and 2 year old.The positives  very clean. We were there mid week and we queued on average 10 mins but during extra magic hours (disney hotel guests allowed into park 2 hours before general public) there were lots of rides where we did not que at all. Magical surroundings. Clean, spacious room at Sequioa Lodge, only few mins walk away from disney village. The train journey to Paris was very simple  35 mins for some culture. The look on the kids faces when they met characters was priceless! Plenty to see and do for toddlers.The negatives  public areas very busy. Getting a photo with characters was a bit of a scrum. The same rides were open each morning during extra magic hours, variety would have been better. Expensive food. Kids meals tended to come without veg  not the healthiest week we've ever had. Definitly worth a visit if you have young children but be research and plan your trip carefully. Book a table at Cafe Mickey for a relaxed way of getting photos with the characters.",Disneyland_Paris
102725968,3,2011-4,United Kingdom,"Arrived at opening time on a one day ticket with my 11 year old daughter, first ride we approached was not open and they could not give us a time when it would be, this also happened on another ride. Pirates of the Caribbean ride was not going to be open at all that day, but the next day which was no good to us, another attraction we approached was not open, and a show we went over to see were told was not showing again that day. The rides we did go on were great, however having visited the Disney parks in Florida on a number of occasions, we found many of the staff were disinterested in giving you a good time, and did not look happy to be there, and for the price you pay for a ticket you should expect more attention and rides which work. Save your money if possible and go to Florida instead, it is worth the wait.",Disneyland_Paris
102087859,2,2011-3,United Kingdom,"Having been to Florida last year & just coming back for a day trip to Disneyland Paris here are my thoughts that might help.1) We did the day trip on the cheap    9.50 sun vouchers for ferry crossing & family park ticket, 2 nights in a travelodge at Dover.   27.50 for 4 people   fuel  food  cheap treatThe kids were excited and enjoys the day but they are only 4 & 6 and didn't notice the things me & my wife did. 1) The park is dirty & run down compared to Florida   rubbish on the floor, bins not emptied, paint peeling on rides etc2) Staff just don't seem to have any interest. In Florida our kids were asked if it was there first visit or there birthday. They we then given a badge to wear and staff would either wish them happy birthday or ask them how their day was when they passed them. We had all on getting a smile out of any of the staff3) The food is shockingly over priced and of a poor quality. We took food & drink into the park   I still don't know whether you are allowed or not but no one stopped us. This allowed us to have this during the day. We were in the park for 9 hrs and spend 22 euros on popcorn & ice creams.4) In Florida smoking is banned except in one or two smoking zones within the parks. In Paris smoking is not permitted on the rides but appears to be acceptable everywhere else. This simply is not good enough for a childrens theme park. Several times in the day we were queue for rides with our children while people smoked all around them.5) Organisation of things in the park is partilculary poor. Pluto came out to sign autographs, he was mobbed by about 30 kids why his  helper  lent against a wall 10 yards away completely not interested. My two queued up to get Pluto's signature but all the normal rules of waiting your turn had been thrown out of the window . We didn't the helper take control? Because he looked about 17 years old and was too interested chatting up a female worker. OverallOur two enjoyed their trip to Disneyland & we proved it can be done on the cheap, however, take the above comments into consideration before spending   500   on a 2 or 3 day stay thereHonesty, save up and go to Florida and experience the real Disney & see how the Americans look after their guests & little ones!",Disneyland_Paris
102053927,5,2011-3,Ireland,"Not long back from a 4 day stay in disneyland paris and i have no complaints what so ever. Stayed in the Hotel Cheyenne, good base, clean, disneychanel in english for kids in the evening and kids got to meet jesse from toy story, goofy and pluto outside the hotel on several occasions and the buses provided to and from the park are just great, brilliant service. The parks and parades are magical!! some rides are closed for refurbishment no matter when you go to disney but you can check on the disney website before you go and see what ones will be closed during your visit and also the map and parades show list available just inside the park also state what rides are closed. The food is expensive in the park but bring your own snacks from the hotel breakfast and fill up your water bottles and you will save loads. There is a cheap supermarket in the train station where you can get tayto, chocolate, bottles of mineral, sandwiches, fruit, beer and wine all for the same price as at home or some things are cheaper than at home. For evening meals if your planning on going out for 3 course meals with beer and wine well then you are gona pay dear, the most expensive meal we paid for was main course for 2 adults and 2 kids and dessert was E65 in annettes diner, there is also a mcdonalds which is the same price as at home. If you have a toddler that drinks diluted juice like mine than i wud recommend bringing your own altho i did find bottles of   Fanta still   which did the job while we were there also that shop in d train station has bottles of babys milk for less than e2 which my 2 year old had no problem drinking!! We had a great holiday, didnt experience any rudeness from staff or other visitors, the characters were lovely to the kids and we will defo be returning in a few years when my toddler is a bit older to really enjoy the experience!! oh one more thing if you have a little princess who is going to want a princess dress your better off geting a dress here at home and bringing it with you E50 60 for a dress that is half that price at home.

101923037,4,2011-3,United Kingdom,"WE VISITED DISNEYLAND PARIS FROM MARCH 20TH     24TH, GIVING US A FULL 3 DAYS, WHICH WE FELT WAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME. ON THE DOWNSIDE OF DISNEY FOR A FAMILY OF 4 FOR LUNCH AND DINNER YOU WILL SPEND OVER   200.00 ON RUBBISH FOOD! AND IF YOU ARE GLUTEN FREE (LIKE ME) TAKE YOUR OWN, AS THE ONLY FOOD YOU   LL BE OFFERED IS    AIRPLANE TYPE PRE PACKED CRAP   , WITH 3 DISGUSTING CHOICES, FOR 1 COURSE COSTING AROUND   20.00! Just unbelievable! As I had been pre warned, I did take (as did my family inc 3 children) all my own food including a lightweight fridge (only weighed 2.5kilos & left it plugged in at the hotel!). We sneaked our picnic lunch in (as bags are searched at the entrance!) in the base of my Granddaughters pushchair!) I brought wine at the airport, as I wasn   t prepared to pay over   7.50 for a small glass! I wish to make it clear we are not a    tight    family but we weren   t prepared to be ripped of wasting money on overpriced and dreadful quality (value range burgers) food! As for Disneyland, it was brilliant! Yes O.K they are doing a few bits of refurbishment on a few areas and it was a bit disappointing to find, after another long walk (!) that some rides were closed. Why they can   t tell you this in their information, is a mystery! But then there is no information on the rides or there suitability to age. Yes they have a height restriction but when you consider my 4yr old grandson, was able to ride    The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and    Crush's Coaster   , for which my daughter and I had no idea that these rides were totally unsuitable for US let alone a small child, who was left tottally traumatised by both rides. It took us a long time to persuade him to return to his favourites    The tea Cups    &    It   s a small world, which was voted our no1 favourite. We stayed at the Hotel Cheyenne, which was peaceful, clean and more than adequate. FINAL TIP  DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU GO! AS ONCE YOUR THERE IT   S VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT EVEN BASIC STUFF. ALSO DON   T TELL YOUR KIDS ABOUT THE GETTING AUTOGRAPHS BECAUSE YOU   LL BE LUCKY TO SPOT MICKEY OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOT AND IF YOU DO HE   LL BE SURROUNDED BY ADULTS WANTING THEIR PHOTO TAKEN AND THE CHILDREN DON   T STAND A CHANCE....YOU   VE BEEN WARNED!! ........ENJOY!",Disneyland_Paris
101833156,5,2011-3,United Kingdom,"Visited Disney 21st   25th March 2011 .. my husband and I and our 3   year old little boy. I use tripadvisor all the time so feel its only fair to write a report. Airport   CDG .. if you want to go to disney via Disney Bus this is realy simple .. follow all the signs for Disneyland Paris... they are all over the airport .. this is the VEA and is the official Disney shuttle. There are alot of  others  but heard a few bad reports on ripping you off .. so I wouldnt bother. It would have cost us 102 euro return for the three of us and takes I believe 45 mins .. but there is a website so you might want to check. We chose TGV .. takes 10 mins .. cost   75 for the three of us .. return .. you have to have your wits about you .. get the shuttle to terminal 2 in the airport then you can get the TGV from there .. we did it purely for cost and for the fact its 10mins, there is a website so you can suss times before you go and book, we didnt book our tickets because you never know with planes being late etc! Takes you into the disney station which is literally next to all the bus stops for the disney hotels and disney is on the right. Everything is very very close to each other. So we found the bus stop for Hotel Cheyenne and waited. Along came the bus on we got .. stood for around 2 mins and then we were at the hotel .. amazing! The ease of the buses provided with your hotel is great for your holiday. Hotel Cheyenne is great .. its clean its basic yes, ranch style , towels changed every day and maid service with beds every day .. which I was impressed with to say its one of the cheaper hotels .. the room had loads of storage space absolutely loads!! 32  flatscreen tv with english channels, not that we watched it .. too tired ha! lovely bathroom with disney toiletries which were a nice touch .. no hairdryer or kettle so I took my own little travel kettle (will get onto that later!) .. but you can hire kettles, hairdryers and all sorts so if you dont want to take its fine. Only complaint I have is we were on a first floor with a buggy .. going fine .. but after a long 12 hour day at the park (!!) you are soo tired so getting up the stairs with the buggy took alot of energy ha! Big double bed and bunk beds in room.. great. We were in block 25. The hotels are huge! We were given info pack on arrival and told about happy hours .. which are 8   10 (not sure if this is winter months   i.e. might be at night as well as summer comes) .. asked what time we would want breakfast every day so we said 7.30 but we could change at any time. Told about buses to the park and basically given everything we need to know .. really good reception service. So next day we went to brekky or should I say the SCRUM ha! you realise how many people are staying when you walk in at 7.30 and the place is PACKED!!! Food, croissants, rolls, cheeses ham, cereal, fruit etc ... lots of people making sandwichs for the day and filling up there juice bottles!!! Everyone does it so dont feel worried about being caught! ha! Then off we went for the bus .. and to disney for our first day! Disney is magical .. Studio open 10   6 and Park open 8 (magic hours for disney hotel people 10 for joe public) till 8pm. Disney Village   where all the restaurants are open till late .. 11pm I think if not later. This is next to the parks. Food around disney .. hot dogs 8 euros, bottle of water 3 euros. There are no juices for little people .. not that we saw .. fizzy pop (coke etc) and water but no juice just so you know. There a no sweets choc either unless you want to buy a disney bag of sweets 6 euro .. so I think you get my drift. There are some nice coffee shops on main street in the park .. the mickey mouse chocolate brioche is scrummy have to say .. 3 euros but worth it for a treat! The  vineopolis  people walk by because its a place where you can sit and watch cartoons but in there is a great take away .. burger fries and a drink 10 euros .. which trust me is good ha! Takes a while to get your head around the food prices! I had read alot of reviews before I went and to be fair it can get confusing. Basic rule is food and drinks are expensive! We were only taking hand luggage but I decided that cost of a case vs food price would be cheaper! now .. i am a flask and sandwichs girl so .. I took cartons of juice .. chocolate .. cheese and biscuits .. even took a loaf cobs and some cheese spread for sarnis .. cakes .. crisps .. tea coffee longlife milk (for room and for flask in the day)   no im not kidding ha ha .. food bags and generally made pack up every morning .. saved a bomb! Now you may be thinking it cant me that expensive .. so ok .. one day my hubby wanted hot dog so .. 1 hot dog .. and three drinks .. 19 euros. Ben and jerrys 3 scoops 5 euros. Dont get me wrong I dont mind paying but I hate being ripped off and im really not tight .. its just you are such a captive audience that they can charge what they want. I was so pleased I had juice and choc crisps for my little boy. take thsoe if nothing else! Ok food at night .. well i'd read about the meal vouchers you can buy and thought quite pricey around   65 for the three of us a night for 1 meal. But I have to say .. if you want a big meal and alot of choice they are really good ... and I would recommend. We didnt buy them but I would for next time. We ate in Annettes Diner first night .. 2 beers 1 juice two burgers chips and a kids meal hotdog chips 58 euros. Annettes Diner do a take away ... we were very lucky that the weather was amazing and warm so one night we had that .. its scrummy .. 10 euros burger chips and kids 7 euros.. so we sat outside and ate that. There is a mcdonalds in the disney village it was absolutely packed and I think its because its the cheapest place on there! 7euros for a meal. Cost 20 euro for two meals and a happy meal. Alot of the restaurants are all you can eat about 25   30 euros each plus drinks on top. So when you consider the food vouchers its a cheaper as they are for 3 courses and a drink   unless you want mcdonalds every night. Your call really on how much you want to spend! We are not that food precious and will eat anything so were happy with spending our pennies on things to take back with us and fun stuff for our little boy. Beer 7 euros pint. Buggy .. you can hire when there .. have no idea on price but to say they dont look like a normal buggy is an understatement .. i would take your own definitely. All in all it was an amazing trip .. we got the TGV back to CDG and it was painless. Disney is amazing .. completely .. I wouldnt change a thing apart from probably buy meal vouchers for at night .. even I couldnt cater for that ha ha .. enjoy every second!!",Disneyland_Paris

101628646,4,2011-3,United Kingdom,"Just got back from a 2 night 3 day trip. We were a little worried before we went, we had been reading some very negative reviews on this site and were not sure what to expect this time round (last visit Nov 09). After a very early start we arrived via Eurostar at 1.30pm. Disney Express a must for anyone choosing Eurostar!! Took the in laws with us and their first words were 'Wow, isnt it lovely'!! A glorious sunny day and all the magic of entering Disney with 7 & 5 yr old kids!! Plenty of characters were found daily, although you do have to read the daily timetable to know where to find them. 27 character autographs obtained! Characters in good form and willing to interact with the friendlier children and adults! Both parks very clean, staff polite and friendly if you are polite and friendly to them!! Manners have to go out of the window as the saying goes 'when in Rome'. Pushing and shoving is just the Europeans way and when you adopt that it makes the experience easier!!! Queues were anything from 5 30 mins, which when you think of places like Lego land or Alton Towers this is the norm for any theme park world over! Stayed at the Santa Fe, a basic hotel but adequate for a short stay when the hotel is used pretty much just for sleeping. Clean and staff friendly. Breakfast can be a bit manic but again forget your British manners and follow the Europeans!! Had half board but this time round (as before) but was not as impressed this time, used the Plaza gardens both nights, 1st night was a bit of a nightmare but 2nd night and a change of staff it was a much nicer experience! Castle under going a bit of a face lift and has some scaffolding round it. Decorated boards have been put up at the front to cover the scaffolding and it didnt affect the beauty of the castle!! The back however is not so pretty and could spoil a first time visit! The castle is only a small area of the park and for somewhere that is open 365 days a year repairs have to be done at some point!Things are expensive inside the parks so take snacks and drinks with you, also pack a lunch from the hotel breakfast. Everybody does it and even the in laws had been told prior to do the same! Food varies in price around the parks anything from 13 36 euros, look around for what type of food and price suits you!If you go with very very high expectations of the parks and look for every little crack in the pavement or chip of paint there is no doubt you will come home disappointed! Remember the park entry cost for 2 parks is just   30 approx a day, roughly the same as 1 UK theme park. A reasonable price considering all the characters and parades. Already planning our next visit! All in all another fab time had by adults and kids!",Disneyland_Paris
101422065,2,2011-3,United Kingdom,"We went with our daughter and family, two grandchildren of 4half and 2. They enjoyed themselves and had a great time. But the adults found the whole experience very dissapointing. There was no magic to the trip for us, the parks looked rundown and tired. There was scafolding round the castle, broken pavements and faded paint on many rides. The food and drink in the parks was ridiculusly expensive,   7 for a pint of beer, nearly   4 for a diet coke in a bar,   12 for burger and chips,   4 for an icecream, etc, etc. The other European guests push and shove their way around the park, have no concept of personal space while queueing, don't bother to queue at all most of the time anyway, not even in the toilets. There are no characters walking around the parks and you have to queue for a meet and greet to get their autographs or a photo taken with them. The characters themselves were mostly lovely when we actually got to the front of the queues and this was the 4 year olds favorite part of the visit. There were big queues on lots of the rides and this was March. We had booked into a Disney hotel in order to make the most of the two hours pre opening but most of the rides were still shut until 10 which made the queues for the only rides open longer than during the rest of the day anyway. We were booked in to the Sequoia Lodge which was just a few minutes walk from the Disney Village. The hotel was clean and the beds were comfortable but they do not even supply tea and coffee making facilites in the rooms. We went to the swimming pool which was a nice size but not very warm. The changing facilities were hopeless with just two changing cubicles in the ladies (none at all in the mens), two toilets and a very small open changing area. They even charge 2 euros for a pool towel. The best thing about it was that the lockers were free. The breakfast buffet was a bit limted and there was nothing hot except toast and there was only one toaster for the whole room full of people (probably 100 or more). There was no variety in the breakfast either, just the same stuff every day. And if you went after7.30am, you had to start your day off with a queue to get in the door.Overall, the children loved it but they didnt know how much better it should have been. The adults found the whole place very disapointing and none of us would ever go there again.",Disneyland_Paris
101232691,1,2011-3,Sweden,"This was my first visit to Disneyland as a childhood dream (now I'm 30:) and i took my nephew 8 years old. 54 Eur for 1 park   1 day. (you should be a superman to visit 2 parkes in 1 day). We went on Monday the 14th of March (Pirats of the carrabian are closed, the train around the park is closed, the parade only 1 at 17:00   no fireworks) and the only thing we did   stayed in the queue! Everywhere! Poor famylies with small children   Disneyland is like a huge market and everything is made for you to spend money and not having fun! I said to my nephew that Disneylan is a fairyland for children and here they are the kings and queens, the next moment I hear from him: LOOK THEY ARE BEATING A CHILD IN DISNEYLAND!!! And it was true! You have to have a nerves of steel and bullockes of a bull:) This was my first one visit too many!!!So respect yourself and love your family   DON'T GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Disneyland_Paris
100987606,4,2011-3,Ireland,"We're just back from our first visit to Disneyland Paris,a 3 night stay, Monday to Thursday. The kids, aged 8,5 and 3 had an absolute ball. Whilst we did enjoy ourselves, it's certainly not as  magical  as I expected. I assumed all staff would be extremely friendly and that the  Disney spirit  would overwhelm, but sadly, I was wrong. We were blessed with three days of fine,sunny weather. Our last day was cold and damp and made such a difference to our level of enjoyment that day. We had no longer than 30 minutes to wait for any of the rides, if we saw a long queue we went on something else until the queue had shortened. We availed of the extra magic hours, but to be honest, there are only a few of the rides open at this time. Because everone is trying to get on the ones that are open, the queues were sometimes longer than we experienced during the day.The hits with our kids were, Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast It's a Small World Le pays des contes de fees Studio tram tour Cars rallyThe older boy really enjoyed the Moteurs stunt show.Some of the attractions closed for renovations were, Pirates of the Caribbean, Slinky dog Zig Zag and the Disneyland raiload.We found the parade at 2.45 in the Studios much more intmate than the larger one at 5pm in Disneyland Park, but it's good to see both. We travelled into Paris one morning on a  mobilis  train ticket ( about    40 for 2 adults and 2 kids, under 4's don't pay) It's about a 40 minute journey and well worth the effort if you can squeeze it in. We got off the train at  Chatelette des Halles  and walked down to  Notre Dame  passing the  Pomdidou Centre  on the way. After a quick coffee and cakes we caught a  Batobus  on the river at Notre Dame, (   14 per adult,    7 per child over 3). Its a hop on hop off service, with 8 stops along the Seine. We got off at the Eiffel tower and took the stairs up the tower to the 1st level for some brilliant views of Paris. We hopped back on the Batobus and got off at the next stop. We walked over the bridge close to this stop and through the gardens at the back of the Louvre, straight on until we reached the Opera House, a beautiful walk! The  Auber  RER train station is close by and we caught the train back to Disney. This short trip has whetted my appetite to get back to this wonderful city very soon, the kids really enjoyed their boat ride too.We were back in Disneyland in time to enjoy that evenings parade and took in a few rides the kids wanted to revisit.We ate in Mc Donalds, had the snack menu in Billy Bob's in Disney village (good value but get there around 7) and had dinner one night in the Rainforest cafe (great theme but be there around 5.30 for opening). We found the fish and chips in Toad Hall in Fantasyland to be fresh, good sized portion. We brought croissants and rolls from the breakfast buffet in the hotel to snack on. I was disgusted with the state of the toilets in Fantasyland when I brought my 3 year old daughter, overflowing sanitary bins and wet floors!!The Disney village seemed a bit tacky with the pavements in disrepair and no liferings to be seen around the unfenced lake (maybe I just missed them???)We stayed in the Sequoia Lodge which was convenient to the parks but nothing special.Be prepared for LOTS of walking, we were up and out early to make the most of our 4 days. It's not a relaxing break but I don't think anybody goes there for that reason. Keep referring to the maps and programme of shows and events, it's easy to miss something. Buy any snacks or drinks at the shop beside the train station, the Disney merchandise in the different shops is all the same price so don't waste time looking for a bargain.All in all , we enjoyed our stay. It needs a bit of a face lift and a bit more sparkle, but we were lucky with the weather and the  relatively  quiet period.",Disneyland_Paris
100850925,3,2011-3,United Kingdom,"I visited Disneyland Paris 2 weeks after it first opened in 1992 and it was chaotic, but great fun. We also visited it again a couple of years later, when it had changed from Euro Disney to Disneyland Paris and apart from the staff being a LOT less friendly it was still good.But this time, oh dear! How run down it has all got! Broken paving all over the place, the HSE would shut this place down in a heartbeat if it was located in the UK. Algae growing over the rides, and the hard landscaping crumbling and poorly kept.Unlike California or Florida, there are absolutely no characters in the park, unless you count the machine gun carrying gendarmes ( Daddy, why are those men carrying machine guns? ). It was very cold, so we bought a  tigger suit  from one of the Disney shops for our 14 month old   he did look very cute and lots of people asked for a photo with him   that was the closest to any characters in the park that day!We're Disney junkies and have been to the 2 US parks many times. We know it's a machine to extract the maximum money, but the quid pro quo is that the park operators give you a really good Disney themed time. The magic is lacking at Disneyland Paris   it just feels like a run down theme park. If you can manage it go to Orlando or Anaheim   they are in an entirely different league.",Disneyland_Paris
100739406,5,2011-3,Ireland,"Went here from 14th   18th March 2011. Had a fabulous time. Parks open at 8am for people staying in hotels in the complex. Have breakfast about 7.30am and get there for 8am. Have until 10am before the general public are allowed in. Try to go on Mon, Tues or Wed. Did not have to queue very much on these days   10 to 15 mins max per ride. Fri was really busy   more like 50 min queues. No problem taking in your own food. I had a small rucksack of food with me every day. They do a security search of bags going in but they are not bothered about food. Snacks and food inside the parks are expensive. If you have children, book Cafe Mickey in the Disney village for lunch with the characters between 12pm and 3pm. (Best time to get in is 12.15pm)They sit with you, come round the tables and get photos with you. Regular menu and regular prices   no extra charge for the characters. We saw six on Tuesday and another six on Friday. Kids loved it! Make sure to wear walking shoes   exhausted by the end of the day but happy! You can hire a buggy for 9 euro a day. Plaza Gardens is good for lunch or dinner   help yourself buffet with all sorts of food. We bought the plus meal vouchers before we went but it worked out more expensive than the menu in many restaurants. i wouldn't recommend it. In the Walt Studios, we did the buffet in Restaurant des Stars but it wasn't great. This is one place where the buffet price was a lot cheaper than I had paid for the voucher. Princesses came out at 11.30am each day but you need to start queueing 11am at the latest as the queue is huge. We had a fabulous time and I would recommend it. I read trip advisor's reviews the evening before we went and was disappointed in what a lot of people said. There are a few potholes but not what I imagined from reading the other reviews. We had no problem finding toilets   all marked on the map and plenty of staff around to help. Toilets were all clean. If staying in a hotel then New York is the closest   only couple minutes walk to Disney Village. We stayed in Newport Bay   the furthest away at about 10 mins walk. Didn't get a chance to look in the Disney hotel. Make reservations for dinner each evening as the restaurants are all busy. Rainforest Cafe will not take bookings. There are lockers near the entrance to leave bags  shopping. Shops inside the park are all much the same and quite expensive. Lovely little Christmas shop as you walk through Sleeping Beauty's castle into Fantasyland!",Disneyland_Paris
100738387,2,2011-3,United States,"just come back from sequoia lodge, hotel is good, location good, room good.In village and parks the food prices are way too high,   12 for burger and chips!!!!in some outlets.  4.50 for half a lager,   58 for the latest princess dress, this is extortion!!!!!!TIPS TO SURVIVE.....Take lots of food with you if you are drivingAlong from hotel Santa Fe there is a garage thats sells drinks, food, wine etc at very reasonable prices but Disney doesn't allow them to sell stuff after 6pm so go there in the morning.Also large supermarket at the outlet, with some restaurants,Take travel kettle, tea, coffee etc as there are penty of sockets in rooms.Beware of Eastern block scammers who try to stop you at village entrance, DON'T SIGN THE FALSE PETITION FOR HOMELESS KIDS (as they want a donation).In the parks be ready for a free for all at the character meet and greet!!!",Disneyland_Paris
100309244,3,2011-3,United Kingdom,"We stayed on a Sun deal,   138 for 4 all in with a night in the Cheyenne hotel and whilst I wasn't horrified I was underwhelmed. The room was clean, albeit with a missing bulb and an arm which came off the chair and a bit of mould in the bathroom but these can be overlooked. The beds were comfortable and everything looked fine. The buffet meal in the hotel can only be described as an ordeal in which you feel you are a processed like an overworked singing cartoon. It's a free for all basically and while the food is of average quality there is absolutely no atmosphere in the massive hall, no characters, no music even, just the din of thousands of other diners. Breakfast was even worth with little choice and no hot food except toast from two toasters between what I guessed was at least a thousand people in our sitting (if you can call the endless stream of people a sitting).Anyway, on to the park and after the 500 meter walk from car park to park you find yourself in DLP itself. The wonder of it all does hit you for a while, especially on Main Street, the detail, the realistic look, but then you find that on further inpection that underneath the surface there isn't much to nourish the soul. 90% of the shops sell overpriced merchandise and the other 10% lacklustre and unimaginative food.Then onto the theme parks themselves, Fantasy Land, Frontier Land etc. OK, the rides were realtively good for the late 80s, but come on we are in 2010 now with home entertainment on playstations etc making this fayre of Autopia and Frontier Land looking decidedly dated. OK, many people don't go for the rides, Alton Towers and a dozen others offering more thrilling, but even the heritage is wearing off. Star Tours (a Star Wars lookalike) looks faded and dated (where's the HD or Dolby Surround, or cushion molded seats), and Captain Eo, courtesy of Michael Jackson, this was dated in the 90s before all the scandal, but does an average 8 year old really have any concept of who Michael Jackson was?Then there are all the little things, faded paint on the Carousel, holes on the ride, graffiti in most of the toilets, potholes, poor customer service and staff who would rather point you in the general direction of something than take you there, true disney style, lack of characters walking around.Don't get me wrong it wasn't terrible. Some of the staff were great and for the price we paid, it was a bargain, but I wouldn't make a holiday of it. You honestly get better value for money at Chessington (with the animals to see as well as cheap thrills) or Alton Park.Lets see Disney reinvent its parks for the 21st century, get rid of the old rides and reintroduce some true innovation to beat back all the whipper snappers once again.",Disneyland_Paris
100241034,1,2011-3,United Kingdom,do not waste your money if you are looking for a holiday like this go to port aventura universal studios in spain this is the magic you are looking for. The resort looks tired and dirty like 60 minute makeover have not finished. The staff are rude we saw a scuffle with the staff and a family while the parade was going on this was because one of the children was over the line where they were meant to be standing. Everything is over priced and they do not care they are ripping youy off. You could be heartbroken if you are taking young children there for a holiday of a lifetime.I can not stress enough do not waste your money,Disneyland_Paris
100034342,5,2011-2,United States,We returned to Disneyland in the half term holidays after a three year gap with our 9 and 11 year old and had a great time. Despite some queues in both parks we still had three busy days and once you have mastered the fastpass and figured out what is busy or not there is a lot to do. Our biggest surprise was Crushers Coaster in the moviepark. It comes over as a quaint family ride but the third sector of the ride has the same impact as Space Mountain and is not for the fainthearted. (Imagine a smooth Space Mountain without 360 and a spinning carriage which leaves you completely disorientated   very clever and worth queuing for).We were still highly entertained by all the traditional Disney rides like Peter Pan and Pirates of the Caribbean.Food is still expensive although we did get some discounts by eating off peak which helped.,Disneyland_Paris
99885941,3,2011-2,Canada,"The lines were not bad in February, ticket machines for entering and fast pass were mostly not working and poorly staffed for help. Grounds not kept up. French were generally friendly people, but not the staff here, found them indifferent to their job, so unlike other Disneylands. Rides were well worn and in need of TLC. Still we had fun and mostly laughed about it.",Disneyland_Paris
99265640,4,2011-3,South Africa,"First time for me at any Disneypark so I was mightily impressed, my partner on the other hand who has visited the main man in Florida agreed he still had a fab time, but the Paris park was not up to the same calibre of its American flagship counterpart.We was travelling with a disabled person, and whilst mostly the park was very understanding and accommodating regarding this, we unfortunately did have a negative experience when visiting the Nemo ride in the Disney Studio's. A helpful  cast member  who was working at the entrance to the ride, directed us to the disabled person entrance via the exit... the lady operating the cars in the ride on the other hand was not so helpful and stated to go on the ride we needed to join the normal queue (which involved pushing into the Q with everyone else that had been queuing a lot longer, and going over a bridge via some stairs) I explained that due to the nature of the disability this was not possible, to which she retaliated in a rude and dismissive manner that if we was not prepared to climb the stairs then we simply cannot go on the ride. I appreciate there are language barriers, but I do not feel this was a language issue as her body language and dismissiveness was very telling. We left the ride having not been able to go on. I was very angry about this, but as we only had 2 days in the park I didn't want to take up time finding the appropriate office to complain. I was actually appalled at her behaviour and although it may seem petty to most, her intolerance was really upsetting. There are ways of talking to people effectively. I wish to highlight that the ride operator in question was a lady of a large build with curly hair, and that she could perhaps benefit from some customer relation training !  The park was very tidy, in fact there was always someone in an elaborate costume no more than 10 meters away with a hand held sweep, and generally all the staff were very helpful   although not as smiley as I imagined given Disney's reputation. I found Magic Kingdom more how imagined Disneyland to be, with recognisable tunes being played through loudspeakers throughout the parks and characters wandering around happy to pose for a photo or sign an autograph. Lots to do, and perhaps needed longer than our booked 2 days. However we still had a brilliant time and would happily revisit in a few years! I highly recommend Annette's diner in the Disney village for a burger served on roller skates and a nice ice cold cherry sprite!",Disneyland_Paris
98996315,1,2011-3,United Kingdom,"Four of us went to Disney Paris for three days two nights (2 adults 2 children 3 and 7)On arrival place looked shabby holes in path big enough to loose the buggy in, suit case got stuck couple of times.We stayed in the Santa Fe Hotel we knew this was the cheaper of the hotels and to be honest the room was ok no real problems until.. We booked for Breakfast and the que was a mile long ,did not help that the French dont seem to understand the concept of cueing (This point gets worse once in the park) Once we got to the front we got greeted by a memeber of staff seemed to me just did not want to be there she made matters worse by stoping us even though I had my ticket and then letting in some familys who were French and a couple from Spain who didnt even have tickets. (As we had the children I decided to let it go) Once in the eating area I was amazed it was just no holes bared people pushing and shoving this totaly scared my youngest. once we were able to sit down I was not in the mood to eat.Once in the Park I was once again suprised at how unfriendly the staff were no smiles and if you ask for some advice they either ignore you or just grunt and the park in general just looks old in places.I was ready for the ques but once again I was not ready to be pushed out the way whilst in a que by French and Spanish at one point my daughter got knocked over it was at this point I lost my temper, (Is there no word in french or spanish for excuse me or sorry) This matter was not helped by the staff who seem to just watch it happen and not help infact on one ride the staff member let people in half way in the que. And why dont they make it no smoking policy once in the ques. Once in the que there is nothing to see would have thought they would have somthing going on to keep you entertainedToilets in the park were badly signpost and there was not enough of them and once you got to one they were dirty.I think Disney need to send there staff on a course on public relations and how to smile and defently a course on que managment.It was a real shame it could have been great ,kids did enjoy it but its a family park there deffently seemed no Disney magic. Its a shame we are planning to go to Florida in a couple of years but this has put me off big time",Disneyland_Paris
98540382,1,2011-2,United Kingdom,"We have just returned from a weekend break with our 3 children aged 4,11,14 and to say we were disappointed is an understatement . We found the park dirty and it's in need of a magic wand to make things look better. The castle was covered with scaffolding so the bottom half was in all of our photos , toilets are terrible with tissue and water everywhere . We actually had a competition amongst ourselves to find a Disney member of staff with a smile on their face .. We are yet to find one! . We have been to Florida Disney world and staff will come over and have a conversation and ask how you are enjoying your stay, even the retail staff seem to be in character they are always happy and polite . My advice to families would be to save your money and go to Alton towers instead, it's closer to home and a lot cheaper.",Disneyland_Paris
98508032,4,2011-2,United Kingdom,"Kids loved it, but I was annoyed with the Fast pass queuing system. It would have been better if they had released more tickets as we were only able to use it once as they had run out and you can only have one at a time. The queues were about 40 mins long which you do expect but it gets a bit annoying. The park was generally clean but where we sat and ate our lunch the bins were overflowing and needed to be emptied. There were no signs for toilets and they were crowded so these could be better and more plentiful . The rides were great because most were accessable for everyone. The staff were fine but could have been a bit more visible I was expecting to see characters like Mickey Mouse walking around but we only really saw characters at the Parade. I felt that more information could be given regarding waiting times because once you were in a queue you had no idea how long your waiting time was. why didn't they put up signs as you queue or have staff to talk to you to pass the time? This would definately make it less boring  I liked the queue system at Pirates of The Carribean because it felt like you were part of the ride as you went through various tunnels to get to the front.",Disneyland_Paris

It seemed a lot smaller and poorly organised than its Floridian counterpart.

Went on Pirates of the Carribean ride, left pushchair amongst many others minus personal belongings, finished ride to find it gone. Spent the rest of the holiday pushchair watching. TIP: take cheap lock and pimp your pushchair to make it less easier to blend with others. Park staff very helpful, got free loan of rental stroller for remainder of stay.",Disneyland_Paris
97932473,5,2011-2,United Kingdom,"When you arrive at Disneyland Paris your heart starts beating to the tune of 'It's a small world', your steps get a little quicker and you feel your body clock turning back years. That's what it's supposed to do. No it's not Florida by a long shot but it's still got the pull, it's still got the Magic. I've done both Paris and Florida on many occasions and I still get that tingle at Paris. The staff are lovely and helpful, they are great with the kids. They work hard making sure the park looks good and is clean and that you don't queue to long for things. It's us that's dirty throwing litter everywhere and moaning when we have to wait ten minutes to be served. When it's busy yes you have to queue, but every theme park is like that. I've never queued more than an hour at any Disney and yet I've queued over 3 hours at Alton Towers. Enjoy yourself at Disney, let go and chill and experience the magic.The park is currently being updated ready for the new theme so some area's are closed but hey things have to be updated so it's not a problem. Everything about this park is amazing and I will definitely being seeing it again soon. Favourite rides:  Runaway Train, It's a small world and Buzz Lightyear. Also this year has the Captain EO show which was the first thing I saw when I first went to Florida in 1988. I loved every second of my walk down memory lane and I think it's something that should be made to stay.Do not hesitate to come and see this magical place whatever your age and have fun.

It is just like any other theme park, crowded, dirty, rubbish everywhere, dirty toilets, indifferent staff, long long queues for fast food, over priced tat in the shops pilled up everywhere with no one to tidy it up, some of the rides look shabby and a bit broken. I was disappointed. We went on a busy day so we were prepared to queue but nothing prepared us for the shock of the way the staff were either indifferent to whether everyone was having a good time or completely absent. Several times we were told to queue (pointed, not asked) in the wrong place and then almost man handled into the right place. Star tours, for example, had broken seat belts and rubbish in the simulator. BTM had a 45 minutes sign but we queued over 1 hour. We were the only people in the burger bar opposite at 11am yet it took the staff 15 minutes to complete our order. There were no characters anywhere except in the parade. The parade was good but there were only 4 floats, one group of 12 dancers and 3 green men from Toy Story. Its a good job it came around twice! No balloon sellers or photographers on Main Street. There was no cast member interaction at either the Haunted Mansion, or Pirates of the Carribean, although we asked a cast member if we could ride in the front and he said yes. How much nicer it would have been if he had asked us though! I never saw a single cleaner in any of the seating areas or in the toilets the whole time we were there. The French are known for their filthy toilets I know but these were no better than anywhere else in France. Last we were going to eat at the Agrabah Restaurant as there were big signs everywhere for it but when we got there it was closed. Why did no body bother to take the signs down if it wasn't open? It has the Disney name but it is everything Walt Disney hated about theme parks when he took his daughters to them in the 1950's. That is why he build Disneyland in Anaheim and I am sure he would be horrified to see what has been done here in France with his name on it. I went to Alton Towers, UK's best theme park in 2010, and it has really up ed its game since Tussauds bought it out. Staff were helpful and friendly, often on hand to direct you about and ask if you are enjoying yourself and there were cleaners about in plenty. Its worth staying this side of the chanel for that. It is the little things, not the lack of queues that make a good day and Disney needs to take its staff back to basics or else take the Disney name off the park and sell out. Save your money and go to Florida or California instead.",Disneyland_Paris
97332607,4,2011-2,United Kingdom,"Just returned from 4 day stay with our two under 6 yrs kids. Stayed at seqouia lodge and had no problems, all staff were very helpful and easy to deal with. f you plan on going make sure that you book for half board. We had no cause to complain about any of the food, but remember they are mass catering so everything is not piping hot all the time. Good selection if you eat in hunters grill buffet, we chose to go out of season and breakfast times were still busy, but everything was constantly being re stocked or topped up so there were no problems. I magine it could be really packed out in peak season though. ** When at breakfast take some freezer  sandwich bags so you can make up a couple of snacks to keep kids going through the day as the park  hotel prices are very high if you eat there. Buffet evening meal at seqouia lodge would be around 100  120 euros for a family of four for one evening. There is a small shop in the train station that sells smaller items, sandwiches sweets etc for less than half the price you would pay in disney village or in the parks themselves. Make sure that you see the motor stunt show in the studio park, and get a good spot half an hour prior to the parades starting. Didn't have any of the problems cited by others here, park toilets were ok, some better than others but this was due to the amount of traffic passing through not a lack of effort, every time you turned around in the park you saw someone with a brush and pan litter sweeping the smallest of items. Our two had a great time, as did we, and would recommend it to friends but as I said the half board option is a must if you dont want to pay way over the odds for you meals.",Disneyland_Paris

96775103,4,2011-2,United Kingdom,"Having just returned from a 3 day break to Disneyland, Paris I would have to disagree with the negative reviews. I visited with my husband and three children (aged 2, 6 and 8 yrs) and stayed at Disney's Sequoia Lodge. Hotel was great   clean, lovely breakfast buffet, pleasant staff and my kids loved the pool. On to the parks themselves :Positives   parks were vey clean, I saw virtually no litter and the toilets were also clean   a must when you have young children. The rides were well maintained and looked fresh. We arrived at Disney Park at 8am every day and got on the rides easily   Buzz Lightyear Laser Spin 3 times in a row with no queue!My kids were the ideal ages as the rides appealed to them. My 2 year old could get on most rides (even the Toy Story parachute) and with the exception of 2 or 3, the older two could get on 'thrill rides'   Thunder mountain, Tower of Terror, RC car.Negatives   Disney Studios did not open at 8am for the 'extra magic hours' for Disney Hotel guests. Although Disney park did open early, only a few rides were open   the same ones each day. However, it did give you the opportunity to go on a few times. Another complaint was that not that many rides actually use the fast pass system   6 in Disney Park and 3 in Disney studios. The parks were very busy at the weekend, mainly with adults and it was slightly annoying that so many couples and groups of adults seemed bizarrely happy to queue for over an hour for a child's ride e.g Dumbo!Tips : Plan ahead, use the early opening for Disney guests. Get on the non fast pass rides very early and get fast passes for the others. Accept you probably won't see everything!! Although you can't get on the rides you can enter Disney Studios at 9.30am so arrive early and make your way to Toy story Playland where you can wait until 10am then get on the rides quick as the waiting time jumps up soon.Food is extortionate so if you're staying at a Disney Hotel   hop on the free No. 50 Shuttle to Hotel D'Elysse, get off, walk a few feet and to your left is the large Val D'Europe Shopping Mall. The food hall is far cheaper and nice   The pizza  pasta restaurant does an adult meal and drink for 10 euros, kids for 6 euros with dessert. Also there is a large supermarket, Autran, where you can stock up on drinks, fruit etc.I have also been to Florida and didn't spend my trip comparing the two. Just enjoy!!",Disneyland_Paris
96633962,1,2011-2,Belgium,"250 total for tickets, parking and food for two adults, two kids. Very disappointing. Very long queues everywhere, even in February. We joined one queue at the  30 min from this point  sign. One hour later we finally got on the ride, which lasted exactly 1min 20 seconds!Some more rides might be a good idea   there are more shops than there are rides.Very little indoor seating at any of the fast food restaurants   fine in summer but not very comfortable on a cold February day. Staff are unfriendly to the point of being rude. Instructions are barked at you. On more than one of the rides, a member of staff came along and tugged at our seatbelt without saying a word, no  excuse me  or  please may I check you have your seatbelt on . As if we were animals being herded. I didn't see a single member of staff smile the entire day and noticed very few smiles on the faces of the other visitors.Nothing magical about it at all. A complete rip off. We'll definitely not be going back.",Disneyland_Paris
96158259,2,2010-9,United Kingdom,"Dear AllI never complain , but I feel that I have been robbed of my money by disney paris. Two year ago we went to disney florida. Wow that was not cheap , but we had a fantastic time. In disney paris we stayed at the hotel santa fe (was ok) the first night i went to the buffet , and for 80 euros we where fed slop. We were all disappointed and I complained to the manager of the restaurant.  After telling him my complaints he shrugged his shoulders and said    do you want to have a word with the chief    , I said    yes    and went into the food area and pointed out to both to the manager and to one of the chief   s what food we had. Seeing me pointing out this food some of the other chiefs came out and joined the chef I was with. Immediately I felt intimidated. I looked around for the manager who brought me over, he had gone??? so I felt I should go and we all left feeling that no one had taken any notice of what I said . From then on the rest of my holiday went down the pan..I then noticed falts in everything from the overflowing bins , long que's i mean really long que's for every thing , the cold fast food , rude staff and poor customer service..Still today 3 months later on , I only have bad things to say about disney paris. I have wrote to the customer complains department, and after all this time i have no responce.We as a family will not be going to disney again.Phil from Swansea",Disneyland_Paris
95910770,1,2011-1,United States,"My expectations were set by my favorable visits to DisneyWorld in Orlando. This place is a brand killing experience. DL Paris looks like they built it 19 years ago and forgot about it. It suffers from a lack of maintenance (potholes in the sidewalks, siding falling off buildings, burned out light bulbs in marquees, peeling wallpaper), the hotel rooms don't meet the standards of the economy hotels in USA , serv ice is SLOW everywhere and there was garbage everywhere (it looked like it snowed cigarette butts and trash cans were overflowing). All of this comes at the normally high Disney prices. Why anyone would spend time here is beyond me. We attended a corporate function with 1,500 people from across the world and the work topics were trumped for the entire week by the negative discussions about the park and hotels. As far as the hotels go, these were the worst I've seen in 30 years of travel.",Disneyland_Paris

95016178,5,2011-1,Cyprus,"We had an excellent time. Only complain was that the package prices vary depending on the country you are booking from. This is unfair, i live in UK and paid 40% less than what my relatives had to pay for the same package!!! We all booked via the Disney website. Disney has to realize they are loosing a lot of business because of this parity.Other than this the meals at Disney village should be upgraded. We tried different restaurants and always ended up commenting  McDonald's would have been a better option . We love the place will visit again and would be happier if the above was taken into consideration.",Disneyland_Paris
94915551,5,2010-8,United Kingdom,"If i lived in Paris, i would definetely have made a Year Pass. This place is magic, it makes you fell like a kid, get enthusiasted and enjoy your stay. If you have more days, enrich your stay with a night in the hotels of the park, although a bit expensive. Great games, attractions, parades and lovely fireworks (i think only in summer).",Disneyland_Paris
94826092,1,2010-5,United States,"I was thrilled to check out a Disney park outside of the US but soon found myself horrified at what I saw. There is none of the Disney service that is standard at the American properties, and the two parks themselves were sad little versions of what makes Disney parks so great. The service was non existent, the rides were pathetic, and the cleanliness was an embarrassment. I cannot recommend strongly enough that anyone seeking a Disney park experience save their money and get to either Disneyland in California or Disneyworld in Florida. The experience could not be more different. The staff at the US parks makes you feel like the most important customer in the world, while the staff at Disneyland Paris made my family feel as if we couldn't leave fast enough. These people owe Walt Disney an apology for defiling his name   they should rename it  Dismal Land .",Disneyland_Paris
94821035,5,2011-1,United Kingdom,"We visit in january and it was cold with the odd rain. However there are loads of attractions inside so we could soon warm up! We did the main disney park on the first day and Thunder mountain and space mountain are not to be missed! There were lots of opportunities to see disney characters thorughout the day and the locations were shown on the map of the park. Small world was closed during our visit. Day 2 we went to the Walt disney park next door and agian there was loads to do. Would definately recomment rock and roller rollercoaster and the stunt show. Also cinemagique and the playhouse disney show, which is done twice daily one in english and one in french. The leg trembler for us was the hollywood hotel hotel ride! Day 3 we went to the walt disney park to cover what we had missed on day 2 and then went to the disney park to cover what we had missed on day 1 or to do some rides again and to see the big parade at 5pm. Fast pass is worth doing as you miss the qeues and costs nothing extra. You scan your ticket on a machine by the ride between certain times to get a fast pass ticket. We were told before going they search you for packed lunches and we thought we may spend a fortune on food in the park which was expensive. However they do scan you bags at eh entrance or search them depending on the queue you are in but certainly did not tell us off for taking a packed lunch. We did have to search for somewhere to eat but there are picnic spots around and on day 3 when it was very cold we were able to eat our lunch in a ice cream parlour as long as we brought ice cream and coffee! The shows are well worth seeing as you see all the disney characters. We found the souvenir shops everywhere and werent much more to buy than what you would expect over in the UK. I would recommend to anyone going to plan your day s before setting out as there is so much to do (we still missed a few attractions) as the shows are timetabled, some once a day so we made sure we were in the right area so not to miss the shows. We had a 2 year old and she was still able to go on pirates of the carribean and lots of other rides etc.",Disneyland_Paris

94480541,4,2011-1,United Kingdom,"I have just returned from here having spent 4 fun filled day with my son. I am 47 and he is 22 and we loved it!! We arrived by eurostar and had the disney express for our luggage which is well worth the extra   just hand in your bags at the station in eurodisney and you go staraight in to the parks while your bags go to your hotel and the same in reverse. WE arrived on the Sunday and queue weren't to bad   however from Monday there were hardly any at all! Even for the most popular rides it was only about 10 minutes at the most! So try to avoid the weekends. If there is a queue give it half an hour and go back as it will probably be gone. Height restictions were very strict when we were there but crush's coaster is not for the faint hearted   it is very dark, spinsand while we loved it some children looked shell shocked getting off!! IF you want to meet the characters I would go for a meal at Cafe Mickey in Disney village (book early) They come around the tables, pose for photos and sign autographs without the queuing, pushing and shoving!! We met Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Pluto. Tigger, Eeyore, Captain Cook, Mr Smee, Stitch and the cat from Pinochio! There is no rush and no set charge   just pick your meal from the menu. It's not a cheap meal  fish and chips 22 euros but no where in disney is cheap. Euro Disney is not a patch on Florida but it's nearer and great for younger children. Just go with an open mind and regress to your childhood and you'll have a great time. Take plenty of Euros though!",Disneyland_Paris
93840657,3,2011-1,United Kingdom,I just wanted to post a word of warning about the huge variation of prices quoted for exactly the same holiday!First trying to book on the phone with Disney we could not book the Eurostar to arrive to give us a few days in Paris before going to Disney.Then I started to book on line with Disney and for 3 of us Eurostar   2 nights hotel and 3 days park entrance came to almost   900We then got a quote from an independent travel company and it was   780Then I tried to do is on line with Eurostar and it came to   595 for exactly the same deal   same hotel etc. I was scared that i had missed something so I called Eurostar and sure enough the deal was for real   300 difference!,Disneyland_Paris
93597662,4,2010-11,United Kingdom,"we went in an off peak season and found that the queues werent too bad if you stay on a disney park ,have your breakfast early so you can get the extra hours in the parks.the food isnt great in the parks and very overpriced,so if you can try to have a big breakfast then snack in the parks and have a meal in the evening off the park,in the downtown disney area.when you first go in the main park,take the train around the park,so you get a little barings to where the big rides are,if you have a child under 5,I would defentley recommend hiring a park buggy as its well worth the money as they get so tired of the walking all day!!!also the main show at 5pm is the same everyday so when youve watched it a couple of times this is the best time to slip off on the big attractions as there are heardly any queues!",Disneyland_Paris

92478058,2,2010-12,United States,"My husband and I visited the park for our 25th wedding anniversary and were guests on 12 27 and 12 28. We used the two day park hopper pass. I am a Disney fanatic and I was so excited to go to Paris Disneyland...it was a disappointment in a big way. First of all, before even getting into the park, we had trouble. We arrived by train and intended to take the shuttle to our hotel, the Radisson Blu. The area for the buses, shuttles, taxis and private cars is three narrow lanes right outside of the train station. You'd think it would have been easy for us but it was chaos. The shuttle pick up zones are not marked; no signs. Fortunately we overheard someone talking about our hotel and asked if they were waiting for the shuttle, which they were. It took at least a half an hour. Although we were right at the curb, all of a sudden about 20 people appeared and stared shoving onto the shuttle ahead of those that were waiting at the curb. The people packed on the shuttle and then the shuttle driver announced that he couldn't drive the shuttle with people standing. Funny how he didn't count or organize the people in any manner to avoid the angry, frustrated group that had to either rearrange, or get off the shuttle. Eventually all children were put on the laps of adults and the shuttle left. This whole ordeal was repeated again every time we took the Radisson Blu shuttle. This hotel is a Disney partner, so I would expect better service and organization. When we arrived at the park the next morning, it was cold and icy. I saw no one clearing snow or putting down gravel or sand to help prevent slips. It was treacherous walking on the steps and sidewalks. There were smokers EVERYWHERE. The amount of smoke was unbelievable and I just about passed out when I got a lungful while waiting in a crowd for a parade to start. Bad enough that I had to experience that as an adult, but really, come on, the cigarettes are burning at kid level all the time. This is obnoxious and unhealthy. Every restaurant we went in, with the exception of the Hakuna Matata, was beyond filthy. Overflowing garbage cans, tables with gobs of food on, around and under them and barely a cast member in sight cleaning up. You would NEVER see this at Anaheim or Orlando Disney parks. Walt would freak. It's not very magical. An interesting, if not disturbing thing I noticed was men in the women's restrooms. Several times I observed this. Maybe this is a European thing? I could understand it if a dad was escorting his very yound daughter, but what was the excuse for the dad with his 10 year old son???? Odd.The queue line up problem was not just in the parking and shuttle area. Since there seems to be a lack of staff, the lines for the rides were also unorganized and chaotic. I need to close on a positive note, so I'll say that as far as structural detail, Paris Disneyland is best. The castle is amazing, the gaslit walkways behind the Main Street stores are lovely and the Discoveryland decor is hands down better than the US Disney Parks. Too bad Paris Disneyland doesn't seem to care enough to keep this park maintained, clean and organized.",Disneyland_Paris
92338628,5,2010-10,Canada,Hey its Disneyland. Expect everything that you see at the other parks with one exception. Where are the 5 hour lines. I am sure that in the middle of summer the crowds are bigger but still at the size likely nowhere like Orlando or Anaheim.This is a great place to spend the day. Food is reasonable in price and everywhere. To make the most you should follow the guide to see all the parades and performers.We went at halloween and it was a different experience. When possible try to get to Disney for a seasonal event. They do it as only they can.Taking the train to the station is not as cheap as it appears. When you arrive you will have to upgrade your ticket and this can be a shock to the pocket book. There are other options and discounts to get there   look into them (there are plenty of hotel shuttles and bus trips for the same or less).Unlike everywhere else in europe you can carry your backpack with you   so stock up of snacks and enjoy your day.,Disneyland_Paris
92198076,4,2011-1,United Kingdom,"Although our pick up was prompt the taxi driver wasnt too sure about what time he should be picking us up for our return journey,we asked to be picked up at 12 o,clock but he insisted that 1pm would be enough time for our 3.05pm departure from charles de gaulle airport. At 1pm i phoned to double check the driver would be arriving soon only to be told he would contact driver and put the phone down.Iphoned back a couple of minutes later and he said he was stuck in traffic and would be another 40 mins , our check in was closing at 2.25 i said, only to be told that we wouldn,t have enough time so sorry madam the traffic was busy and they weren,t coming at all .I told them it was a very bad service as we had been stranded with no transfer to the airport and we had a young child with us,the only compensation they could offer was to refund us 55 euros ,which we have not yet received, and it cost us 80 euros to get a taxi from our hotel ! So to cut a long story short we had 2 mins before our check in closed and as easyjet says if your late we wont wait ,we had to jump a queue of about 200 plus people and run to the departure gate ,i suffer from chest pain and found the whole episode very traumatic as did my husband and child . Any one planning to travel with easyjet please be aware that every flight leaving charles de gaulle all check in at the one check in lane .you really need to be there at least 2 hours before your departure. On a high note we really enjoyed our stay at disney in the sequoia lodge.The food in beaver creek was about the best in disney .",Disneyland_Paris
92061774,4,2011-1,Germany,"Just returned from a 4 days family trip to Disneyland with my two boys aged 6 and 9. Reading the previous negative reviews for the same visiting period, which do not match our great experience, I list below a few simple tips to make the most out of your visit. 1. Stay in a Disneyland hotel, have breakfast early (e.g. 07:30) and enjoy the 2 extra hours that the Park is open only for hotel guests (from 08:00   10:00 ).2. Do your internet search before going and plan the attractions you want to visit if you have limited time available. To me the most joyfull and of course popular ones are: In Disneyland Park (i) Peter Pan's flight, (ii) Pirates of the Carribean, (iii) Thunder Mountain Roller Coaster and in Disney Studios (i) Rock 'n Roller Coaster Aerosmith, (ii) Toy Story Parachute jump (iii) The Stunt's 45 mins show3. Timing and location is everything when visiting so do read the programs, be there 20 minutes earlier before the shows and DO USE the FASTPASS whenever available. It is better to wait in line for 10 mins to get a fastpass rather than 1  hours in minus 5 degrees. For those complaing about the long queues, I wonder if they used the fastpass. Go and gather the more fastpasses you can and then plan the sequence of rides accordingly, spending time for shopping and dinning. 4. If you are there only for 1 2 days and you have spent so much money... buy the Premium VIP fastpass at 60EUR per person to get immediate access at every attraction. I saw people entering from the  exit , flashing their VIP fastpasses to the attaction handler and getting immediately in front of every raw.5. The prices for dining are indeed a rip off. So, make sandwitches or have some snacks for the kids. Many people was preparing them from the hotel buffet breakfast... It's far better to have a good breakfast and snacks during the day, rather than loose more time in queues for the restaurants, even with reservation.6. Stay until the closing time. People leave half an hour early to avoid the rush... BUT that's the best time to visit attractions that had the longest queue. We did Buz Lightyear flashing gunshot 4 consecutive times just before the closing time. During the day the waiting time was never below 40 mins for a single ride.7. Read the programs for special parades events like Fantillusion which was available only until 06 January and started 5mins after the official closing time of the park !!! 8. If you have many days availalble start your day early, spent the morning for the extra 2 hours, then get the train to Paris at 10:15 You will be there before 11:00... visit Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum and or shopping at Gallerie Lafayette behind Opera (BTW: dining at 6th floor offers great views of Paris). If you get the RER A train back to Marne La Vallee in the evening you may still have time to re enter the park for 1 2 attractions.9. The purpose of the visit are the Parks but leave a couple of hours, ideally during the last day of your visit that you have visited everything in the Parks, to go to Marne la Vallee Outlet village. It's 5 miles away and depending on the season you can really find great bargains at 60% discounted prices. If you find items that you would buy anyway at normal retail prices, then that shopping can even compensate the expenses of your whole trip.10. Buffalo Bill's Dinner Show is heavily advertised but it is overrated. Still, it is a different experience that the kids will enjoy and the food is plenty and good.Enjoy your visit, do not let  queues by passers  to spoil your mood and be prepared for an upwards budget spending.",Disneyland_Paris
91995748,1,2010-12,United Kingdom,"We spent the 20 Dec 2010 in the Disney park and by lunchtime attractions were starting to close or break down. Getting about the park was ridiculous as the snow was turning to freezing slush and people with strollers were experiencing extreme difficulties. As parades and attractions were declining we left the park in early evening to find the hotel buses were suspended and we had to walk to our hotel   Sequoia Lodge. The next morning the snow outside the hotel was compacted and though slippery was suitable for walking on and reasonable dry. We walked to MGM studios and easily got in an into the first building which was populated with shops and food outlets. As we entered the park proper we found a sea of slush and many attractions closed. The open air Magic Carpet ride was open but it was left to the riders to clear the deep snow from the seats. People headed for the indoor attractions to find that under cover marshalling areas were closed on the pretext of dangerous snow levels on roofs and people were being advised to return later. The Aerosmith Roller Coaster became almost impossible to get onto. Fast pass booths were closed presunably because of weather damage. Animagiqe and Cinemagique were two indoor shows that were closed which upset hordes of people who were hoping for a half hour or more respite from the cold and wet. The only things that appeared to be functioning were where money could be taken. Shops and restaurants. These places became almost claustrphobically overpopulated. Snow ploughs were attempting to clear parade routes but were only succeeding in making pedestrian areas even more treacherous. By lunchtime we had enjoyed only 4 hot chocolates each and one ride for with our grand children so we gave up and retried the Disney park. Things were a little better but only for the mainly indoor attractions. Again there were lengthy delays as staff were not letting queues from getting too large by limiting those being let into the undercover walkways. It was impractical to queue outside of marshalling areas because of the large crowds wandering aimlessly. A slight easing of the weather enabled two of the parades to operate but the main wish of our grandkids to see princesses was not achieved. In the end we booked an expensive character dinner just to enable them to meet Mickey, Minnie and some of the animal characters. Instead of any magic we saw confusion and raw commercialism at its worst . Our 8th visit in 9 years was a total disaster and will never pay for a winter visit again.",Disneyland_Paris
91984642,2,2010-12,United Kingdom,"Well I was really looking forward to this trip over the Christmas period, as were my family. I have 2 small children 5 and 3. It was absolutely freezing which obviously is not Disney's fault but it was snowing when we arrived which was quite magical but the snow settled on ice and previous snow which basically created a lethal surface with which to walk on!We made it through the crowds and survived Christmas eve and Christmas Day, even through the ludicrous queues to get on the shuttle bus from the hotel parks hotel, the french have no idea how to queue!Anyway we were going to the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show on Christmas Day and on entering the show I promptly slipped on a wet floor. They had made no effort to clean or sweep the floor which was like an ice rink. The pathways up to the entrance were not cleared of ice snow..I expected more from Disney.Anyway to cut a long story short I ended up in a french hospital for 7 hours on Christmas night on my own as my husband had to watch my children. In fairness the staff were very pleasant at Disney but I think they knew they were very wrong in not cleaning putting something down to make floor less slippery.It ruined my holiday but I think the children still enjoyed themselves...favourites were Buzz Lightyear ride, Peter pan ride and Live animated Stitch.Glad I looked on here before we went for tips..Don't catch shuttle from hotel to parks..walk along canal river at back of Disney..brings you out at Disney Village and much less hastle!Take rolls batches cheese and ham from buffet breakfast to eat throughout the day.we actually took a suitcase of our own food drink which was a life saver.Rainforest cafe was great to eat...everywhere is expensive but you get an experience with this too!",Disneyland_Paris
91827418,5,2010-9,United Kingdom,"If staying at a Disney hotel make good use of your extra hours & your fast pass it will help avoid the long queues. Not all rides use fast pass so go to the nemo ride 1st to avoid at least an hour wait, similair with the toy story rides. If you want lunch the shop by the train station sell drinks sandwiches & fresh rolls much cheaper than the parks & you can take them in with you.Remember to take a mac in case it rains they are around 8 euros (child size) for a thin rain poncho in the disney shops.Have fun!",Disneyland_Paris
